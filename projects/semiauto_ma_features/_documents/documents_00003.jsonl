Previous research into the pathophysiology of ET suggested underlying cerebellar abnormalities. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nIn this study, we added electromyography as an index of tremor intensity to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (EMG-fMRI) to study a group of ET patients selected according to strict criteria to achieve maximal homogeneity. With this approach we expected to improve upon the localization of the bilateral cerebellar abnormalities found in earlier fMRI studies. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe included 21 propranolol sensitive patients, who were not using other tremor medication, with a definite diagnosis of ET defined by the Tremor Investigation Group. Simultaneous EMG-fMRI recordings were performed while patients were off tremor medication. Patients performed unilateral right hand and arm extension, inducing tremor, alternated with relaxation (rest). Twenty-one healthy, age- and sex-matched participants mimicked tremor during right arm extension. EMG power variability at the individual tremor frequency as a measure of tremor intensity variability was used as a regressor, mathematically independent of the block regressor, in the general linear model used for fMRI analysis, to find specific tremor-related activations. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nBlock-related activations were found in the classical upper-limb motor network, both for ET patients and healthy participants in motor, premotor and supplementary motor areas. In ET patients, we found tremor-related activations bilaterally in the cerebellum: in left lobules V, VI, VIIb and IX and in right lobules V, VI, VIIIa and b, and in the brainstem. In healthy controls we found simulated tremor-related activations in right cerebellar lobule V. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur results expand on previous findings of bilateral cerebellar involvement in ET. We have identified specific areas in the bilateral somatomotor regions of the cerebellum: lobules V, VI and VIII. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAlthough essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common hyperkinetic movement disorders ( ), the underlying disease mechanism is poorly understood. ET has long been considered a benign disorder, but opinions about the disabling nature of ET are changing ( ). \n\nCerebellar abnormalities are commonly found in investigations of the pathophysiology of ET. Yet, post-mortem studies have provided conflicting results, with cerebellar degeneration reported in some ( ,  ) but not all studies ( ). \n\nSimilarly, neuroimaging results in ET are also incongruent, but do provide support for cerebellar involvement. In structural imaging the most frequent result is cerebellar abnormality in ET, although this is not consistently reported. These reported abnormalities are located in the anterior and posterior lobules of the cerebellum, although not all studies specify the specific areas in the cerebellum ( ). Positron emission tomography experiments consistently report changes in blood flow in the bilateral cerebellum and in some cases in the red nucleus, thalamus and inferior olive during performance of a motor task ( ,  ,  ). Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies, examining motor tasks in ET patients, report abnormalities in widespread areas of in the (bilateral) cerebellum but are not able to point to specific locations due to methodological limitations ( ,  ). Clinically, cerebellar abnormalities would fit well with the presence of symptoms associated with cerebellar malfunction in ET, such as intention tremor ( ,  ). \n\nAlthough many of the results point towards the cerebellum, overall studies and especially functional neuroimaging studies, are inconclusive about the specific areas of the cerebellum involved in ET. One cause contributing to this imprecision in findings may be that \u2018ET\u2019 used to be the label for \u2018tremor not otherwise specified\u2019, resulting in a heterogeneous group with high variability in clinical presentation, response to therapeutic intervention and on etiologic level. In this study, we have attempted to define a more homogeneous group of ET patients by requiring a clear diagnosis and in addition a positive response to propranolol medication. We selected propranolol for this study, as it is a drug that has obtained level A evidence for efficacy in ET ( ). \n\nMoreover, we improved upon existing functional imaging methodology in ET by combining electromyography (EMG) and fMRI. This novel approach allows recording tremor simultaneously with brain activity and to directly relate tremor to brain activity in the analysis. We expected to improve upon the localization of the bilateral cerebellar abnormalities found in earlier fMRI studies. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThis study was conducted in two academic hospitals in The Netherlands: the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) and the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam (AMC). Patients who had a definite diagnosis of ET according to criteria defined by the Tremor Investigation Group were included ( ). All patients had bilateral upper limb tremor, an age at onset <\u00a065\u00a0years, and a disease duration >\u00a05\u00a0years. A positive family history was present in most patients (see  ) but not required for inclusion. Patients had to report a positive subjective response to propranolol and could not use other tremor medication. Patients and healthy controls (age- and sex-matched) were all right-handed as assessed by the Annett Handedness scale ( ) and had a score >\u00a025 on the Mini Mental State Examination to ensure proper understanding of the task. Exclusion criteria were neurological comorbidity (for patients: other than ET), age <\u00a018\u00a0years and the use of medication (other than for ET) affecting the central nervous system. The study was approved by the medical ethical committees of the UMCG and the AMC. This study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki (Seoul, 2008) and all participants gave written informed consent. \n\n\n### Study set-up \n  \nPatients quit propranolol for a minimum of three days before participating in the study; 3-day withdrawal is sufficient to largely eliminate propranolol taking into account the elimination half-life of 3\u20136\u00a0h or 12\u00a0h for the long-acting formulation ( ). Tremor was assessed off medication using the Fahn\u2013Tolosa\u2013Marin Tremor Rating Scale (TRS) ( ) and a visual analog scale (VAS). The TRS is composed of three parts. Part A consists of assessment of tremor amplitude during rest, posture, movement and finger-to-nose maneuvers. Part B consists of tremor-inducing tasks, including writing, two standardized Archimedes spirals, a line-drawing task and a water pouring task. In part C the patients rate the limitations they experience in daily life due to tremor. Part A and B were performed and videotaped for both hands, separately. An experienced movement disorders specialist (J.D.S.) blindly determined TRS scores for part A and B. The range of the total TRS (part A, B and C) is 0\u201388. The VAS subjectively rated tremor severity, patients marked a 10\u00a0cm line ranging from 0 to 10, 0 meaning no tremor at all and 10 meaning intolerable tremor. In all patients, propranolol was washed in again at the end of the study, according to a personalized schedule under supervision of neurologists specialized in movement disorders (M.A.J.T, K.L.L and A.F.R) in both centers. \n\n\n### Motor tasks during EMG-fMRI \n  \nAn fMRI scan was performed, while EMG was recorded simultaneously, off-medication. During scanning patients executed a motor task in which they were instructed to alternate periods of 30\u00a0s rest with periods of 30\u00a0s right hand and arm extension without supporting the hand and arm. The left arm and hand were relaxed which was verified by EMG. An additional task, in which the arm extension was combined with silent reading, was included in the same experiment. To maintain transparency of the results presented here, these blocks were not used for analysis in this study, but were analyzed for a different purpose ( ). Here, we analyzed 10 motor task blocks of 30\u00a0s that did not involve reading. Healthy controls mimicked a tremor during right arm extension by self-paced wrist flexion extension. Before scanning, participants were instructed and practiced the task outside the scanner. We asked the participants to raise their arm only slightly, because this was enough to evoke tremor when supine in the scanner. As large movements were also not possible due to limited space in the scanner bore, the disruption of the magnetic field due to movement was limited. All subjects received visual task instruction using slides during scanning. \n\n\n### EMG-fMRI acquisition \n  \nImages were acquired on a Philips 3T MR scanner (UMCG: Intera, AMC: Intera and Achieva, Philips, Best, The Netherlands) with SENSE-32 channel (UMCG) and SENSE-16 channel (AMC) head coils. In both centers, T2*-weighted, 3D functional images were obtained using multislice echo planar imaging (EPI) with an echo time (TE) of 30\u00a0ms and a repetition time (TR) of 2000\u00a0ms. Per TR, 39 axial slices, with a field of view (FOV) of 224\u00a0mm, flip angle of 70\u00b0 with a 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064 matrix and isotropic voxel size of 3.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0mm were acquired. To provide anatomical information, additional T1-weighted 3D anatomical scans with an axial orientation and a matrix size of 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256\u00a0mm were obtained (isotropic voxel size 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm). EMG was recorded simultaneously (BrainProducts GmbH, Munich, Germany (UMCG) and MicroMed, Italy (AMC)), with pairs of sintered silver/silver-chloride MR-compatible EMG electrodes were placed above five right arm muscles: extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), flexor carpi radialis (FCR), extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) and first dorsal interosseus (FDI). To verify that the left arm and hand were relaxed during the tasks, EMG was recorded from bipolar EMG channels with electrodes placed above three left arm muscles, as well: extensor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi radialis and first dorsal interosseus. A ground electrode was placed on the left wrist joint. Further EMG recording procedures were similar to the methodology developed in our previous studies ( ,  ). \n\n\n### EMG-fMRI analysis \n  \nEMG data were corrected for scanning artifacts using the MR correction algorithms incorporated in Brain Vision Analyzer (Imaging Artifact Reduction method ( ); UMCG data) and FARM (fMRI artifact reduction for motion ( ); AMC data). After correction, data was further analyzed in Matlab (Matlab R2007a, Mathworks, Natrick, USA) using custom-made scripts. For each segment of 2\u00a0s, corresponding to one scan, the frequency spectrum was calculated using the default fast Fourier transform in Matlab (FFT). The individual frequency at the dominant tremor peak (both for tremor and mimicked tremor) was determined for each patient and healthy control by visual inspection of the segments. Patients without a clear and regular tremor peak in the EMG during the task segments were excluded from further analysis. Due to scanner artifacts in the EMG that could not be removed sufficiently by EMG artifact correction, determination of a dominant tremor peak was not possible for these patients. Total spectral power in a 5\u00a0Hz symmetrical band around the individual (mimicked) tremor peak frequency was exported for each segment and each right arm EMG channel, resulting in five vectors of the length of the number of scans/segments. The vectors of the three EMG channels with the highest total power were averaged. This procedure resulted in an EMG power vector with one entry for every scan. Next, this vector was orthogonalized with respect to the motor task block vector using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, to subtract the information that is already present in the block vector ( ). The orthogonalized EMG vector (referred to as residual EMG or r-EMG vector) now provides a measure of additional EMG relative to the mean EMG value across the task block. It represents the variation in tremor intensity over time. Subsequently, the r-EMG vector was element-wise multiplied with the block vector to obtain a vector that only has nonzeroes for the r-EMG during the task blocks, and zeroes otherwise. Finally, this vector was convolved with the canonical HRF, scaled by its SD and used as a regressor in the fMRI design matrix in addition to the block regressor. See   for a representation of EMG characteristics for one patient. \n\nfMRI data were analyzed using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL, London, UK;  ). Preprocessing consisted of standard realignment and coregistration steps. A group-specific anatomical template was created using DARTEL (diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra) for a more precise inter-subject alignment to take age-related changes in anatomy into account ( ). Individual functional data were normalized and smoothed using the DARTEL template and an 8-mm full-width half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. To reduce movement artifacts, the six movement parameters derived from realignment corrections were entered as covariates in each individual analysis. Inspection of the EMG was used to correct the block regressor for actual on- and offsets of the motor task. Each single-subject first-level model thus consisted of a (corrected) block regressor, a residual-EMG (r-EMG) regressor and the six movement regressors. We refer to the resulting activations as block-related activations and tremor related activations. \n\nIn this manner, activations that are common across task blocks will be mostly explained by the block regressor, whereas activations due to variations in tremor intensity will be mostly explained by the rEMG regressor, thereby overcoming the problem in traditional designs used for investigating tremor, where block- and tremor-related activations are mixed. \n\nAt second level, dummy variables were inserted in the model, coding for each scanner, to model the effect of the different scanners used in this study. Second level within-group comparisons for the task and r-EMG contrasts, and between-group comparisons for each individual contrast were made on whole brain level. Activations were considered significant at a threshold of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 (FWE corrected) and an extent threshold (k) of 20 voxels. This whole brain analysis was only applied for the cerebral hemispheres while cerebellar activations were analyzed with a more specific method for infratentorial regions (see paragraph below). \n\nGiven the tremor, it is plausible that the ET patients made more head movements than healthy controls when executing the motor task. To test this we used the scan-by-scan realignment parameters calculated during fMRI preprocessing. We calculated the total range of head motion for each translation direction (x, y and z) and each rotation direction (pitch, roll and yaw) separately, across each session per participant and compared groups. \n\nAs we hypothesized cerebellar involvement in ET, we additionally performed an analysis focused on the cerebellum using the Spatially Unbiased Infratentorial Template (SUIT) toolbox ( ). This toolbox isolates the cerebellum and creates a mask. The individual T1 image of the cerebellum was normalized to the SUIT template using nonlinear deformations. The contrast images resulting from the first-level whole-brain analysis were masked with the created cerebellum mask, normalized into SUIT atlas space and smoothed with a Gaussian filter of 4-mm FWHM. Contrasts were thresholded at voxel level p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, uncorrected, applying a cluster size of 20 voxels. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Subject characteristics and behavioral results \n  \nA total of 40 ET patients were initially included in this study. Data of twenty-one ET patients and twenty-one age- and sex-matched healthy controls were analyzed. Reasons for exclusion of patients from further analysis were either too much head-movement during scanning (one patient), unidentifiable tremor peak during fMRI data collection (16 patients), failure of equipment during scanning (one patient) or incorrect normalization to the DARTEL template (one patient). Analyzed ET patients (12 males) had a mean age of 51.6 (SD 17.8) years and mean disease duration of 29.8 (SD 15) years. Healthy controls (14 males) had a mean age of 50.6 (SD 16.4) years. Age and sex did indeed not differ between the analyzed groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.86 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.35, respectively). Patients had a mean TRS score of 25.7 (SD 10.8) and a mean VAS score of 6.2 (SD 2.1) off medication. Mean peak frequency during scanning was 7.5\u00a0Hz in patients and 5.1\u00a0Hz in healthy controls. See   for characteristics of patients and healthy controls. No left arm movement was seen in the EMG signal. Head movement during scanning did not differ between ET patients and healthy controls (see  ). \n\n\n### Block-related activations, cerebrum \n  \nThere was no significant effect of scanner on brain activation, i.e. the results were the same for the different scanners used in this study. \n\n#### Within-group results \n  \nFor ET patients, block-related activations (block regressor) were found in the left motor- and premotor cortex and in the supplementary motor area (SMA). Additional activations were found in the right supramarginal gyrus, frontal areas, primary somatosensory cortex, superior parietal cortex and right thalamus (T\u00a0>\u00a06.49, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE, k\u00a0=\u00a020, see  ). In healthy controls, we found block-related activations (block regressor) in the left motor cortex and bilateral premotor cortex and the SMA. In addition, activations were observed in the left supramarginal gyrus, the inferior parietal cortex and frontal regions (T\u00a0>\u00a06.95, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE k\u00a0=\u00a020, see  ). \n\n\n#### Between group comparisons \n  \nNo significant increased activations were detected in ET patients when compared with healthy controls. Healthy controls had increased activations in the left sensori-motor cortex compared to ET patients (both T\u00a0>\u00a05.34, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE, k\u00a0=\u00a020, see  ). \n\n\n\n### Tremor-related activations, cerebrum \n  \n#### Within-group results \n  \nFor ET patients, tremor-related activations (r-EMG regressor) were detected in the left motor-, premotor and somatosensory cortex. Additional activations were found in the bilateral visual cortex, the middle part of the cingulate gyrus and the right motor cortex (T\u00a0>\u00a06.74, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE, k\u00a0=\u00a020, see  ). In healthy controls, no significant activations were seen in relation with mimicked tremor (T\u00a0>\u00a07.05, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE, k\u00a0=\u00a020). \n\n\n#### Between-group comparisons \n  \nCompared to healthy controls, ET patients showed increased activations in the right motor cortex, middle part of the cingulate gyrus and the left somatosensory cortex (T\u00a0>\u00a05.45, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE, k\u00a0=\u00a020 see  ). The reverse contrast (healthy controls\u00a0>\u00a0ET patients) was not further investigated because we found no significant mimicked tremor-related activations in healthy controls. \n\n\n\n### Block-related activations, cerebellum (SUIT analysis) \n  \nBlock-related activations in the cerebellum of ET patients were found in the right lobule V, VI and VIIIa (T\u00a0>\u00a03.58, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected, see   and  A). Healthy controls showed a large cluster of block-related activations in the right lobules V, VI, VIIIa and b (T\u00a0>\u00a03.61, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected, see   and  C). ET patients had no increased activations compared to healthy controls in the cerebellum. Healthy controls showed increased activations in the right lobules V, and VI and in Vermis VI compared to ET patients (both T\u00a0>\u00a03.32, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected, see  ). \n\n\n### Tremor-related activations, cerebellum (SUIT analysis) \n  \nTremor-related activations in the cerebellum were found in left lobules V, VI, VIIb and IX, right lobules V, VI, VIIIa and b and in the brainstem (particularly the dorsomedial parts of the pons and midbrain) in ET patients (T\u00a0>\u00a03.58, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected, see   and  B). Healthy controls showed mimicked tremor-related activations in right cerebellar lobule V (T\u00a0>\u00a03.61, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected, see   and  D). Increased activations were detected in ET patients when compared with healthy controls in the midbrain, pons and cerebellar lobules V and VIIIb, all left-sided. Healthy controls showed increased activation compared to ET patients in the right crus II (T\u00a0=\u00a03.32, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected, see  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nUsing a combination of EMG and fMRI we identified specific, somatotopically explicable areas in the bilateral somatomotor regions of the cerebellum associated with tremor. The technique employed here has been used successfully before in a small sample of ET patients, in patients with cortical myoclonic tremor and in Parkinson's tremor ( ,  ,  ). By selecting patients with a clear diagnosis of ET, we aimed to identify brain areas correlating specifically with ET. To our knowledge this is the first controlled EMG-fMRI study investigating a large, more homogeneous group of ET patients. \n\n### Block-related brain activations \n  \nThe participants performed a unilateral (right) arm extension task and, not to our surprise, the classical motor network was activated in both patients and healthy controls. These motor network activations were stronger in healthy participants compared to patients, probably because the tremor simulating movement made by the healthy controls was deliberate and had an observed larger amplitude than the trembling in ET patients. The simulated tremor movements made by the healthy controls were also more constant than the involuntary tremor of the ET patients. The block-regressor therefore likely explained more of the (simulated) tremor-related activation \u2013 the part that is common across task blocks \u2014 in healthy controls than in ET patients, also probably leading to increased activations. \n\n\n### Tremor-related brain activations \n  \nIn ET patients, tremor-related activations were found bilaterally in the cerebellum: in left and right lobules VI and V, and additionally in right lobules VIIIa and b, and in the brainstem: in dorsomedial parts of the midbrain, bilaterally, and pons, left-dominant. These results expand on earlier findings that the bilateral cerebellum is involved in ET ( ,  ,  ). Indeed, with our EMG-fMRI approach, we discovered specific, well-defined areas within the cerebellum, thus adding detailed information to the more diffuse localizations that have previously been described. \n\nWe identified two distinct tremor related activations in lobules V-VI and in lobule VIII of the right cerebellum, ipsilateral to the right hand and thus particularly implicated in left-hemisphere functions. This particular cerebellar location indeed accurately fits with a previous study on functional connectivity of the cerebral motor hand region which revealed somatomotor regions of the cerebellum ( ). In this previous study by   representation in the cerebellum was cross-lateralized and had a double representation, with a strong primary somatomotor representation in lobules V and VI, and a slightly weaker secondary representation in lobule VIIIb. However, in addition to the cerebellar activity ipsilateral to the tremulous hand, activations were also observed in the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere at the same locations as in the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere. Activations were evident in the   left   somatomotor areas, lobules V and VI, and at a lower threshold we found activations in the   left   lobule VIII as well. Thus, we found increased activations in specific somatomotor areas of the   bilateral   cerebellum. The additionally observed increased brainstem activations in the dorsomedial parts of midbrain and pons may point at involvement of the reticular input nuclei of the cerebellum. This putative role of cerebellar input sources in the tremor-related functional changes generates new questions concerning possible underlying causes of pathology to be addressed in future studies. We like to point out, in this respect, that these activations were specifically   tremor  \u2014rather than   movement   related, as the brain activation in these areas covaried with tremor intensity over time   independently   of movement task performance. \n\nIn healthy controls activations covarying with simulated tremor intensity were found in the ipsilateral cerebellum, right lobule V. This corresponds to earlier findings in an EMG-fMRI study examining similar motor tasks in healthy participants ( ). So, in comparison with simulated tremor, ET patients show additional contralateral activations in the cerebellum. \n\nThere are different theories about cerebellar abnormalities in ET. According to the oscillating network hypothesis, tremor is driven by several components in a tremor network, that all act as oscillators ( ). Within this cerebello-thalamocortical tremor circuit, the cerebellum may act as one of these oscillators. The GABA hypothesis states that ET is associated with GABAergic dysfunction within the cerebellum, as evidenced by increased 11C-flunazenil binding to GABA-receptors in the cerebellar cortex, increasing with tremor severity ( ,  ). This leads to a third, neurodegenerative hypothesis, that is based on signs of neurodegeneration such as Purkinje cell loss and torpedoes that have been reported particularly in the cerebellar cortex in ET ( ,  ), at the same locations as where GABAergic dysfunction is found. \n\nOur findings could fit in several ways in these hypotheses. We found hyperactivity in multiple parts of the bilateral cerebellum, which could be explained by either primary or secondary effects of ET. Hyperactivity may be primary as a result of neurodegeneration leading to cerebellar atrophy as found in a recent study ( ). We hypothesize that the affected cerebellar cells are deficient and disorganized, making them less efficient, and this inefficiency could induce increased activations. On the other hand, the cerebellar hyperactivity may be secondary because of compensation of another defect in the cerebello-thalamocortical tremor circuit. \n\nBilateral activation in unilaterally challenged tremor may seem odd at first sight. Activation of the right cerebellum is congruent with the right hand and arm extension task and the activated motor cortex in the left hemisphere. Left cerebellar activation points at functional coherence with cortical regions of the right hemisphere, i.e., opposite to the executive motor cortex for right arm movement. In this respect, it is noteworthy that, at a lower threshold, we indeed found increased activations in the right cerebral cortex in ET patients compared to healthy participants. These activations were located in the anterior parietal and premotor cortex. Together, these areas are known to play a major role in sensorimotor transformations underlying task-related visuomotor control ( ) and the organization of stereotypic movement ( ). Increased coupling between   left   cerebellum and   right   parietal cortex was recently demonstrated by functional imaging investigating multisensory processing ( ), independently of right or left arm involvement. One might therefore speculate that ET patients encounter more difficulties in maintaining a steady raised-arm position, which is imaginable because of their tremor, and that the increased activations in the functionally coherent areas of left cerebellar and right anterior parietal and premotor cortex reflect increased higher-order somatosensory processing implicated in motor tuning during posture maintenance. \n\nWhether the activations we found are the cause and/or consequence of tremor cannot be distinguished on the basis of fMRI \u2013 which is an associative technique - alone. To make such a distinction, longitudinal studies or interfering techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation might be helpful, but even then, the highly plastic and flexible human brain may make it impossible to make this distinction. Yet, by using a method that focuses on the anatomy of the cerebellum, we were able to more precisely localize the parts in the bilateral cerebellum that are involved in ET. \n\n\n### Methodological considerations \n  \nIn this study, the use of propranolol was one of the inclusion criteria we applied to define a homogeneous group of ET patients. This is one of the many variables that can be chosen for patient selection. The advantage of choosing this variable is the future option to compare the current propranolol group with other ET patient groups using different medication. This is a first step at an attempt, as far as we know, to differentiate medication-based subtypes of ET. \n\nA common difficulty in fMRI research lies in selecting a suitable task for healthy controls that corresponds well with the patients' task. In this study, a mimicked tremor was used. Consequently, the two groups were actually performing a different task: we asked the tremor patients to maintain their right arm in a postured position, while the healthy controls had to deliberately move their hand. These tasks were chosen to allow optimal distinction of brain networks involved in involuntary tremor as opposed to compensation or afferent feedback by deliberate, mimicked tremor movements. The mimicked tremor movement overall had a slightly lower peak frequency and had a larger flexion\u2013extension movement of the right wrist compared to the tremor in ET patients. The effect of this behavioral difference can be seen in the task-related activations: the healthy controls showed a more widespread and a higher activation signal in comparison with the ET patients. We would like to emphasize however, that for our design and analysis that focuses on identifying tremor-related activations, it is not important that the participants, patient or control, execute the task exactly in the same way, or that their (mimicked) tremor (amplitude or frequency) is the same. Our analysis takes variation in task execution, leading to tremor intensity variation, into account and actually even depends on it. If there would be absolutely no variation in tremor intensity, our r-EMG regressor would be zero and we would not find brain activations related to tremor intensity variability. \n\nFinally, one may wonder why we did not identify activations in the cerebellar nuclei, also hypothesized to be involved in ET generation ( ). Finding activations in small structures, such as the cerebellar nuclei, is a challenge. Spatial resolution and intersubject variation of its shape with functional specialization of subcompartments may play a role in the absence of activation of this cerebellar region with 3-T data acquisition. In addition, high iron content in the deep cerebellar nuclei decreases the blood oxygenation level dependent-signal making functional imaging a difficult matter, that requires not only higher MR field strength but also novel dentate normalization methods ( ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn the current study, we used EMG-fMRI to identify brain activations specifically associated with variations in tremor intensity in essential tremor patients. Including a more homogeneous patient group and adopting the EMG-fMRI technique for data collection and analysis probably allowed to now identify specific bilateral areas in the cerebellum involved in essential tremor: lobules V, VI and VIII. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: t0005\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tAge\tSex\tMean tremor frequency (Hz)\tAge at onset (years)\tDuration (years)\tFamily history\tHead tremor\tAlcohol response\tPropranolol use (mg)\tTRS-score off medication\tVAS-score off medication\nPatients\tPatients\tPatients\tPatients\tPatients\tPatients\tPatients\tPatients\tPatients\tPatients\tPatients\tPatients\n1\t21\tMale\t10\t10\t11\t+\t\u2212\t+\t40\t15\t5.4\n2\t22\tMale\t7\t12\t10\t\u2212\t\u2212\t+\t20\t13\t5.2\n3\t27\tMale\t7.5\t0\t27\t\u2212\t\u2212\t+\t160\t22\t8.7\n4\t30\tFemale\t8\t15\t15\t+\t\u2212\t?\t20\t17\t2.9\n5\t32\tFemale\t7\t3\t29\t+\t\u2212\t+\t40\t22\t6\n6\t35\tMale\t8\t7\t28\t+\t\u2212\t?\t80\t17\t7.8\n7\t46\tMale\t7.5\t5\t41\t+\t\u2212\t+\t80\t19\t4.4\n8\t47\tMale\t7\t15\t32\t+\t\u2212\t+\t40\t15\t6\n9\t48\tFemale\t7\t10\t38\t+\t+\t\u2212\t120\t37\t5.4\n10\t53\tFemale\t7.5\t28\t25\t+\t+\t+\t30\t35\t7.8\n11\t53\tMale\t8\t16\t37\t+\t\u2212\t+\t50\t19\t8.6\n12\t57\tFemale\t7\t22\t40\t+\t+\t?\t10\t23\t4\n13\t62\tFemale\t8.5\t5\t57\t+\t\u2212\t?\t100\t36\t8.5\n14\t63\tMale\t7\t43\t20\t+\t\u2212\t+\t40\t17\t3.4\n15\t63\tFemale\t7.5\t39\t24\t+\t\u2212\t+\t80\t29\t7.4\n16\t64\tMale\t6.5\t12\t52\t+\t\u2212\t+\t20\t17\t4\n17\t65\tFemale\t7.5\t60\t5\t+\t+\t?\t80\t20\t2.7\n18\t69\tMale\t7.5\t40\t29\t+\t+\t\u2212\t40\t45\t9.2\n19\t72\tMale\t6\t10\t62\t+\t+\t+\t320\t48\t9.2\n20\t74\tMale\t9\t50\t24\t\u2212\t\u2212\t?\t80\t32\t6.6\n21\t80\tFemale\t6\t60\t20\t+\t\u2212\t+\t80\t41\t6.9\nMean (SD)\t51.6 (17.8)\tM: 12F: 9\t7.5(0.9)\t22 (18.9)\t29.8(15)\t\t\t\t72.9(67.8)\t25.7(10.8)\t6.2(2.1)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHC\tHC\tHC\tHC\tHC\tHC\tHC\tHC\tHC\tHC\tHC\tHC\n1\t20\tMale\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n2\t22\tMale\t3.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n3\t27\tMale\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n4\t30\tFemale\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n5\t33\tFemale\t3.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n6\t36\tMale\t7.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n7\t47\tMale\t6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n8\t49\tMale\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n9\t52\tMale\t6.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n10\t52\tMale\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n11\t56\tMale\t3.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n12\t57\tFemale\t6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n13\t59\tFemale\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n14\t59\tFemale\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n15\t60\tMale\t5.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n16\t60\tFemale\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n17\t62\tMale\t4.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n18\t68\tMale\t5.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n19\t68\tMale\t5.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n20\t72\tFemale\t7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n21\t74\tMale\t6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMean (SD)\t50.6 (16.4)\tM: 14F: 7\t5.1(1.2)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n### Caption\nPatients and healthy controls characteristics.\n### Footer\nVAS: Visual Analog Scale, range 0\u201310.

To clarify the functional role of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) for semantic processing with respect to semantic decision making compared to semantic processing per se, we used a linguistic task that involved either a binary decision process (i.e., semantic categorization; Experiment 1) or not (i.e., silently thinking about a word's meaning; Experiment 2). We observed associative priming effects indicated as neural suppression in bilateral superior temporal gyri (STG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), occipito-temporal brain areas, and in medial frontal brain areas independently of the linguistic task. Inferior parietal brain areas were more active for silently thinking about a word's meaning compared to semantic categorization. A conjunction analysis of linguistic task revealed that both tasks activated the same left-lateralized occipito-temporo-frontal network including the IFG. Contrasting neural associative priming effects across linguistic task demands, we found a significant interaction in the right IFG. The present fMRI data give rise to the assumption that activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) in the semantic domain might be important for semantic processing in general and not only for semantic decision making. These findings contrast with a recent study regarding the role of the LIFG for binary decision making in the lexical domain (Wright et al. 2011). \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nWhile automatic language processes are described as proceeding without awareness and producing benefits and no costs, controlled language processes are described as slower acting and requiring effort and awareness (Posner and Snyder  ). In Psycholinguistics, behavioral evidence from priming studies on lexical access suggests that automatic lexical retrieval can be affected by controlled strategic processes depending on experimental parameters such as the stimulus onset asynchrony  (SOA; De Groot  ; Altarriba and Basnight-Brown  ), the proportion of related prime\u2013target pairs (PRP; De Groot  ; Altarriba and Basnight-Brown  ) and the linguistic task (De Groot  ; Balota and Chumbley  ; Balota and Lorch  ; for reviews, Neely  ; McNamara and Holbrook  ). The present priming study focused on the effect of linguistic tasks on the neural response related to automatic lexical-semantic processing. In the light of a considerable controversy regarding the exact function of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) in lexical-semantic processing with respect to language-specific versus domain-general cognitive functions (decision making), we examined the functional role of the LIFG using two semantic linguistic tasks that differed in the presence of a binary decision process. Recently, Wright et al. ( ) investigated the role of the LIFG by studying the neural effects of lexical processing with respect to a binary decision process using a lexical-decision task (LDT) and a passive listening task. They showed that activation of the LIFG was larger for the LDT than the passive listening task. In contrast, passive listening elicited higher activations in a cluster composed of the right superior and middle temporal gyri (STG, MTG). At first glance, the absence of activation in the LIFG for passive listening reported by Wright et al. ( ) supports the view that LIFG may be involved in semantic decision making only. However, neural semantic priming effects (Wheatley et al.  ; i.e., suppression of neural activation for related compared to unrelated word pairs) and neural word repetition priming effects (Chee et al.  ) have been reported in the LIFG with linguistic tasks that did not require a binary response, namely silent reading and silently thinking about the meaning of words. The absence of consensus between the studies of Wheatley et al. ( ), Chee et al. ( ), and Wright et al. ( ) may be due to the fact that both the paradigms (Priming vs. Word presentation) and the linguistic tasks (Silently reading vs. Passive listening) did not activate semantic properties of words in the same way. In the present research, using the same experimental design and the same linguistic materials, we compared the neural response related to lexical-semantic processing by contrasting two semantic tasks that involved either a binary decision process (i.e., semantic categorization task: natural/manmade decision; Experiment 1) or not (i.e., silently thinking about a word's meaning; Experiment 2). \n\nThe role of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in semantics was intensively investigated in the last two decades (for a review, Thompson-Schill et al.  ; Bookheimer  ; Noppeney et al.  ). Activation of the LIFG is discussed as especially contributing to the processes required for semantic decision making (Demb et al.  ; Gabrieli et al.  ; Wagner et al.  ; Roskies et al.  ) and strategic semantic retrieval (Sylvester and Shimamura  ). \n\nSemantic processing using lexical tasks involving a binary decision like the LDT, semantic judgment or categorization tasks shared activations in temporal brain areas such as the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), the MTG, and the STG, in the inferior parietal lobe (IPL), and particularly, in the LIFG (Demb et al.  ; Roskies et al.  ; Wagner et al.  ; Kotz et al.  ; Copland et al.  ; Rossell et al.  ; Giesbrecht et al.  ; Raposo et al.  ; Kuperberg et al.  ; Ruff et al.  ; Wright et al.  ). Roskies et al. ( ) showed that brain activation during a two-choice semantic synonym task (i.e., subjects indicated whether two words had the same meaning) compared to a rhyme-judgment task was modulated within the LIFG. This task-driven activation of left inferior frontal regions was discussed as possibly subserving controlled \u201cend-stage decision processes\u201d that interact with other brain regions like the temporal cortex to access, select, gate, or retrieve semantic information stored in the lexical entries of the mental lexicon. This interpretation is in accordance with Wu et al. ( ) suggesting activation of a separate fronto-parietal network for semantic decision making and it matches the general role of frontal regions during cognitive control processes (Duncan et al.  ; Fuster  ; Miller and Cohen  ; Koechlin et al.  ). Recent neuroimaging studies showed that the neural response underlying semantic processing in semantic priming paradigms was affected by the explicit (Semantic judgment task vs. LDT) versus implicit nature of a binary linguistic decision task (Kuperberg et al.  ; Ruff et al.  ). Thus, semantic priming in implicit tasks was related to semantic suppression in the left anterior IFG and the right anterior orbito-frontal gyrus (Kuperberg et al.  ), as well as in the left STG and bilateral middle frontal gyri (cf., Rissman et al.  ). In contrast, for explicit semantic tasks, differential effects were observed with semantic suppression in the LIFG by Ruff et al. ( ), and semantic enhancement (i.e., increased neural activation for related compared to unrelated word pairs) in the left IPL by Kuperberg et al. ( ). Both studies showed consistent Task by Relatedness interactions in the left IPL with suppression for the LDT and enhancement for the semantic judgment task. Neural suppression effects for the implicit linguistic task might be explained by facilitated lexical access induced by either automatic spreading of activation that typically occur with short SOAs (i.e., 50 msec; Ruff et al.  ), or the use of semantic expectancy strategies that occur with long SOAs (i.e., 800 msec; Kuperberg et al.  ) as proposed before in lexical priming studies (Collins and Loftus  ; Copland et al.  ; Wheatley et al.  ; Gold et al.  ; Raposo et al.  ). In contrast, neural enhancement effects for the explicit semantic task might be related to postlexical semantic matching mechanisms that might have been induced by the explicit nature of the task and that are especially induced by high PRPs present in both studies (cf. also, Kotz et al.  ; Rossell et al.  ; Raposo et al.  ; Kuperberg et al.  ; for reviews, Henson  ; James and Gauthier  ). Although the findings of Kuperberg et al. ( ) and Ruff et al. ( ) underline that linguistic task effects affect the neural response related to semantic processing, both studies cannot shed light on the function of the LIFG with respect to automatic semantic processing because semantic processing might have been affected by lexical strategies induced either by large SOAs or large PRPs. In the present study, we tested the functional role of the LIFG in automatic semantic processing with respect to a semantic decision making process controlling for SOA and PRP. \n\nIn contrast to linguistic tasks requiring a semantic or lexical decision, semantic processing using linguistic tasks that do not involve a binary decision process led primarily to activation of temporal brain regions including inferior, middle, and superior temporal regions (Petersen et al.  ; Howard et al.  ; Moore and Price  ; Wright et al.  ). The temporal brain areas are assumed to support activation of lexical entries within the mental lexicon (Howard et al.  ; Fiebach et al.  ). It appears that both kinds of tasks (i.e., with a binary decision or not) show neural effects in temporal brain areas but linguistic tasks involving a binary decision process seem also to involve activation of inferior frontal brain regions (cf., Wright et al.  ). However, as pointed out before, neural semantic and repetition priming effects have been found in the LIFG using linguistic tasks requiring no binary decision (Chee et al.  ; Wheatley et al.  ). So, activation of the LIFG in semantic processing seems not to be restricted to complex semantic retrieval demands like in a semantic decision making task. To date, no study directly compared the neural effects of a semantic task requiring a binary decision with a semantic task that did not. \n\n\n## Current Study \n  \nIn the present study, we evaluated the impact of a binary semantic decision process on the neuroanatomical localization of neural associative priming effects within a fronto-parieto-temporal network (including the IFG, ITG, STG, MTG, and IPL) that is assumed to support semantic processing at word level (for a review, see Price  ; Bookheimer  ; Wu et al.  ) by contrasting two semantic tasks that differed with respect to a binary semantic decision, (i.e., semantic categorization [Experiment 1], and silently thinking about a word's meaning [Experiment 2]). In both experiments, we used an associative priming paradigm with a short SOA (300 msec) and a low PRP (6.25%) to increase the chance to capture automatic lexical access of semantic representations assumed to be stored in each lexical entry. The focus lay on the functional role of the LIFG in semantic processing. \n\nWe tested whether the LIFG was specifically activated by semantic tasks involving a binary decision process. For Experiment 1, we expected associative suppression effects in temporal and frontal brain areas with a predominant activation of the LIFG shown to be especially involved during semantic decision making (Demb et al.  ; Gabrieli et al.  ; Wagner et al.  ; Roskies et al.  ; Wu et al.  ). For Experiment 2, alternative hypotheses were formulated. If the LIFG was specifically task-related as suggested by Wright et al. ( ), then associative suppression effects should predominantly be observed in occipito-temporal regions (Petersen et al.  ; Howard et al.  ; Moore and Price  ; Fiebach et al.  ). However, if the LIFG also takes in charge lexical-semantic processing irrespective of the nature of the task, then similar results in Experiments 1 and 2 should be expected. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThirty-six native speakers of German (17 females, 19 males, mean age = 26.45 \u00b1 4.9, age range 21\u201341 years) recruited from a database available at the Department for Systems Neuroscience (University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany) took part in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. All participants were right-handed according to the Edinburgh Inventory (Oldfield  ; mean laterality index of 97.1 \u00b1 5.05%). All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. None had a history of neurological or psychiatric disease. All participants gave informed consent after the experimental procedure was explained and were paid for participation. This study was approved by the research ethical committee of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. Eighteen of the 36 subjects (8 females and 10 males, mean age = 26.3 \u00b1 4.6 years, age range: 21\u201341 years) were assigned pseudo-randomly to Experiment 1 (semantic categorization) and the remaining 18 subjects (9 females and 9 males, mean age = 26.6 \u00b1 5.2 years, age range: 21\u201338 years) were assigned to Experiment 2 (silently thinking about a word's meaning). None of the subjects participating in Experiment 2 took part in Experiment 1. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nCritical items were 60 morphologically simplex concrete German nouns of the open class category. These items were adapted from a previous fMRI study of the neural representation of the bilingual mental lexicon (Isel et al.  ). Half of the words (  n   = 30) referred to natural entities (e.g., Frucht ), whereas the other half (  n   = 30) referred to manmade entities (e.g., Koffer ). The mean age of acquisition (AoA) of the critical words was 2.7 years (\u00b10.1) for the 30 natural concrete nouns and 3.3 years (\u00b10.1) for the 30 manmade concrete nouns. Target words were matched for word frequency (mean word frequency: natural nouns = 34 [SEM = 7.9], manmade nouns = 22 [SEM = 5.9]; CELEX database, Baayen et al.  ), word length (mean word length: natural nouns = 5.4 letters [SEM = 0.2], manmade nouns = 5.8 letters [SEM = 0.2]) as well as for concreteness and imageability (MRC Psycholinguistics database, Coltheart  ). Prime words in the related and unrelated conditions were matched for frequency (mean word frequency: related condition = 28 [SEM = 6.8], unrelated = 31 [SEM = 7.3]; CELEX database, Baayen et al.  ). \n\nIn the related condition, prime\u2013target word pairs were associatively related and therefore were matched for associative strength  (mean association strength: natural nouns = 39.7% [SEM = 2.9%], manmade nouns: 42.1% [SEM = 2.3%]). In the unrelated condition, prime and target words did not present either a phonological/orthographic, morphological, or semantic/associative link. Finally, in both the related and unrelated conditions, natural noun targets were primed by natural nouns whereas manmade noun targets were primed by manmade nouns. Table   displays examples of word pairs in the related and unrelated conditions. \n  \nExamples of word pairs in the related and unrelated conditions \n    \nIn addition, we selected 420 filler pairs (300 word\u2013word pairs, 60 \u201cblank screen\u201d\u2013word pairs [12.5%; neutral condition], and 60 symbol pairs [12.5%]). Among the 300 word\u2013word pairs, half of them were constituted of two natural nouns, whereas the other half was constituted of two manmade nouns. The nouns used for creating the filler pairs were matched on different dimensions (frequency, number of letters, imageability, and concreteness). For each word\u2013word pair, the nature of the relation existing between the prime word and the target word was carefully inspected by two native speakers of German for ensuring that the two words did not share semantic or associative properties. All neutral pairs consisted of a blank screen of 300 msec followed by a target word (50% natural and 50% manmade words). Finally, half of the symbol pairs consisted of a series of six identical symbols (e.g., %%%%%%), whereas the other half was constituted of six different symbols consisting of the repetition of two different symbols (e.g., %$%$%$). \n\n\n### Experimental design \n  \nIn order to minimize the use of a possible postlexical semantic matching processing strategy, a low proportion of related prime\u2013target pairs (PRP) was used (i.e., 6.25%). By means of a Latin square design, four experimental lists were created such that related (e.g., Saft \u2212FRUCHT ) and unrelated (e.g., Anzeige \u2212FRUCHT ) pairs were balanced across four different lists. Each target was presented under both priming conditions, but no participant saw the same prime or the same target twice, thus avoiding possible practice effects that could arise from multiple presentations of an item (Slowiaczek and Pisoni  ). Furthermore, although there was no orthographic overlap between prime and target words (i.e., a same letter at the same position in the word), primes were presented in lowercase letters, whereas targets were presented in capital letters in order to minimize sensorial match between primes and targets. In each list, the 30 related, 30 unrelated, and 420 filler pairs were organized into five sessions, with session order counterbalanced across subjects. Each session comprised 96 trials (6 related pairs, 6 unrelated pairs, and 84 filler pairs). In each session, item pairs were pseudo-randomly interspersed according to the two following constraints. First, each type of pair (related, unrelated, filler, neutral, symbol) was presented in no more than three consecutive trials. Second, no more than three pairs with natural or manmade targets were presented in succession. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nIn the related, unrelated, and filler conditions, two German words were presented successively. Each word-word trial consisted of a fixation cross presented in the middle of the screen for 500 msec that was followed by (1) a blank screen presented for 100 msec, (2) a written prime word presented in lowercase letters for 200 msec, (3) a blank screen for 100 msec, and (4) a written target word presented in capital letters and remaining on the screen until the participants responded (maximal response time was limited to 1800 msec; see Fig.  ). The same timing was applied for the neutral and symbol pairs. For the neutral pairs, the prime word was replaced by a blank screen for 200 msec. For the symbol pair, the prime word was replaced by a blank screen for 200 msec, and the target was replaced by a series of either identical or different symbols. The SOA between prime and target was 300 msec. The use of a short SOA between prime and target (300 msec) ensures to reduce the risk of semantic expectancies (i.e., creation of a mental list of potential associates). The intertrial interval (ITI) separating the single trials varied between 2000 msec and 2000 msec plus one repetition time (TR; here TR = 2.37 sec) to increase the sampling rate of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response (Josephs et al.  ). The stimuli were presented visually via projection to a mirror directly above the participant's head at eye level. The experimental procedure was programmed using the software presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems,  ). \n  \nTiming (in milliseconds) used in each experimental trial of Experiment 1 (semantic categorization [SC]) and Experiment 2 (silently thinking about a word's meaning [SilTh]). \n  \nCritically, Experiments 1 and 2 differed with respect to the linguistic task. However, a linguistic task involving a binary decision was used in Experiment 1 (i.e., semantic categorization), a linguistic \u201ctask\u201d that did not require a binary decision was used in Experiment 2 (i.e., silently thinking about a word's meaning). \n\n#### Experiment 1: semantic categorization \n  \nParticipants were asked to decide whether each item presented in capital letters (i.e., the second word of each trial) was natural or manmade (i.e., semantic categorization). For the symbol pairs, participants indicated whether the series of symbols were identical or different. Participants responded using their left hand. Half of the participants (  n   = 9) used the forefinger for the response \u201cnatural\u201d and the middle finger for the response \u201cmanmade\u201d and the other half (  n   = 9) used the reversed pattern. The first session was preceded by a short practice session of 12 items before scanning started. Practice was repeated until participants responded without errors. \n\n\n#### Experiment 2: silently thinking about a word's meaning \n  \nIn the related, unrelated, neutral, and filler conditions, the trial timing was identical to the one used in Experiment 1 except for the presentation duration of the target word. The written target word was presented in capital letters for 300 msec followed by a blank screen for 1500 msec. The same timing was applied for the presentation of symbol pairs. As in Experiment 1, the prime word was replaced by a blank screen for 200 msec in the neutral and symbol trials. All other parameters (i.e., SOA, variable ITI) and the software used for stimulus presentation were equivalent to Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, inspired by Chee et al. ( ), participants were instructed to read each uppercase target-word silently and to think of its meaning (i.e., deeply process its semantic properties). Participants performed the semantic processing from the onset of the target until the next trial started. The experimental task of Experiment 2 (\u201csilently thinking about a word's meaning\u201d) did not require an overt behavioral decision. To ensure that participants carefully processed the critical target words, a paper\u2013pencil postscanning recognition-test was administrated outside the scanner after the completion of the main experiment. The recognition-test was composed of 240 words. Among these words, 30 words were critical target words of the experiment (\u201cold\u201d target words, 1/8) whereas, the other 210 words were not (\u201cnew\u201d target words). For each word, participants were told to indicate whether this word was presented during the experiment (\u201cold\u201d word) or not (\u201cnew\u201d word). The first session was preceded by a short practice session of 12 items before scanning started. Practice was repeated once if participants did not understand the task. \n\nEach of the five sessions lasted for \u223c10 min, with 1\u20132 min rest between each session. \n\n\n\n### Behavioral data analysis \n  \n#### Experiment 1 \n  \nA counter module was started at the onset of the visual target presentation to register RT using presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems). We recorded both reaction times (RTs in msec) and accuracy (in %). Time-out was set at 200 msec and at 1800 msec; if the participants responded before 200 msec or after 1800 msec, the response was coded as missing. A correction procedure (mean \u00b1 2SD) was applied on the RTs for correct responses in order to discard extreme values. RTs were then averaged in the two experimental conditions across participants and across items. Priming effects were calculated by subtracting the averaged RT in the related condition from the averaged RT in the unrelated condition by participants and by items. \n\n\n#### Experiment 2 \n  \nThe postscanning recognition-test resulted in accuracy rates that are indicated by the percentage of hits (percentage of \u201cold\u201d words that were correctly recognized as \u201cold\u201d) and of correct rejections (percentage of \u201cnew\u201d words that were correctly identified as \u201cnew\u201d). We computed the mean percentage of hits and the mean percentage of correct rejections of the postscanning recognition-test per participant to gain accuracy rates. \n\n\n\n### fMRI acquisition and analysis \n  \nAll imaging data were collected with a 3.0-Tesla Magnetom TrioTim syngo MR B13 whole body system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Image acquisition consisted of a fast   T  -weighted sequence (localizer) and   T  *-weighted sequences for functional images. Functional images were acquired in 38 axial slices using a BOLD-sensitive gradient-echo echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence with an echo time (TE) of 30 msec, a flip angle of 90 degrees, a TR of 2.37 sec, and an acquisition bandwidth of 100 kHz. The matrix acquired was 64 \u00d7 64 with a field of view (FOV) of 192 mm , resulting in an in-plane resolution of 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm. Slice thickness was 3 mm without interslice gap. Each trial had a length of 2.7 sec followed by an ITI in milliseconds varying from 2000 msec to 2000 msec + 1 TR. The functional measurements were carried out in five sessions of about 10 min length. There were 96 trials per session (480 trials, in total). In each session, about 240 volumes were recorded. For each run, the functional scanning was always preceded by five dummy scans to insure tissue steady-state magnetization. After functional scanning, a high-resolution (HR) 3D   T  -weighted sequence for anatomical images was performed (12 min). HR   T   images were acquired for coregistration of the functional images (data matrix = 256 \u00d7 256, slice-thickness = 1 mm, FOV = 256 mm , TR = 2.3 sec, TE = 2.98 msec). The whole experiment lasted for about 1 h. Preprocesing of fMRI data was carried out with Statistical Parametric Mapping SPM2 (Wellcome trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK,  ). First, the functional images were checked for motion-related artifacts per participant per experimental session. The exclusion criterion was set to 3 mm deviation from the initial position of the head at the beginning of a session according to the six movement parameters. Then, all functional images were corrected for slice timing, spatially realigned, normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template, and smoothed using a Gaussian filter of 8 mm. A high-pass filter was used to remove low-frequency drifts. \n\nRandom-effects analyses were conducted using SPM8 (Wellcome trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK,  ). At single-subject level, we modeled each experimental condition (related, unrelated, filler pairs, neutral, and symbol trials) as separate events using the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) supplied by SPM8 and its temporal derivative to correct for the implied impreciseness in timing, resulting in two regressors per experimental condition. The onset of the second word of each pair (i.e., the target word, or the presentation of the symbol string) was defined as the onset of the HRF used in the regressor. For Experiment 1, we added two regressors for incorrect and missed trials to explain variance introduced by error trials. Six realignment parameters (three translation, three rotation) estimated during preprocessing were added as regressors of no interest. We computed individual contrast images for the critical conditions (related, unrelated) by subtracting the activation associated with the symbol condition from the related and unrelated condition for each linguistic task, respectively. We used the symbol condition as visual baseline condition in both tasks to subtract out any activation associated with motor responses in Experiment 1 and with activation related to basic processing of visual stimuli for both linguistic tasks. Otherwise, a comparison of both linguistic tasks would have resulted in a main effect of semantic categorization in motor brain areas. \n\nThese individual contrast estimates for the critical conditions for both linguistic tasks were subjected to a group analysis. At the group level, we ran a 2 \u00d7 2 full-factorial model with the within-subject factor Relatedness (levels: related, unrelated) and the between-subject factor Linguistic task (levels: semantic categorization, silently thinking about a word's meaning). In addition to the full-factorial model, we conducted a conjunction analysis across both linguistic tasks to examine whether both tasks recruit overlapping brain areas. For the analysis of fMRI data, the resulting statistical parameter maps were thresholded at   P   < 0.001 uncorrected. All brain areas surviving this threshold are reported in the results section. However, we restrict the discussion of data to effects found in a priori regions of interest (ROI) such as inferior and middle frontal regions, inferior parietal, middle, superior, and inferior temporal regions including the fusiform gyrus. We report the significance level at the peak level and at the cluster level corrected for multiple comparisons (family-wise error [FWE] corrected   P  -values). Only clusters of at least 25 connected voxels (i.e., 675 mm ) are reported. Given the a priori hypothesis of linguistic task effects in the LIFG, we also ran ROI analyses using small volume correction (SVC) implemented in SPM8. It is recommended to derive the location for the ROI from meta-analyses of functional imaging studies that explored the process of interest like \u201csemantic processing\u201d (Poldrack  ; Poldrack et al.  ). ROI analyses were performed with 15 mm spheres around the peak voxel (a) in the LIFG (MNI coordinates:   x   = \u221244,   y   = 24,   z   = 4, see   for location) showing activation for \u201csemantic processing\u201d in a meta-analysis provided by the Neurosynth database (source:  ; number of implemented studies: 60), and (b) in the LIFG (MNI coordinates:   x   = \u221236,   y   = 33,   z   = \u221212) showing linguistic task effects in the Wright et al. ( ) study. Although statistical effects drawn from ROI analyses should be corrected for multiple comparisons (cf., Poldrack  ), we used liberal significance thresholds of   P   < 0.005 (uncorrected) with at least five connected voxels to avoid Type-II errors (cf., Lieberman and Cunningham  ). \n\nFor labeling of brain regions, we transformed MNI-coordinates to the Talairach space and used the \u201cTalairach Daemon Client\u201d (Lancaster et al.  ,  ). All coordinates were reported in MNI space in the results section. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Experiment 1 \n  \n#### Behavioral data obtained in the MRI scanner \n  \n##### Reaction times \n  \nThe mean RTs averaged across participants and items and the standard errors of the mean (SEM) are displayed in Table  . We subjected the correct RTs to an omnibus test consisting of a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by participants (  F  1) and by items (  F  2) in which Relatedness (2 levels: related, unrelated) was considered as a within-subjects factor and in which List (4 levels: list 1, list 2, list 3, list 4) was considered as between-subject factor. The factor List was introduced merely to extract any variance due to the counterbalancing of critical items. A significance level of   \u03b1   = 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. The lack of any interaction with List (  Fs   < 1) indicates that the counterbalancing of items in the four experimental lists did not introduce variance in the results. Therefore, all further tests were performed on data collapsed across list. We then submitted the correct behavioral RTs to one-way ANOVAs with the within-subject factor Relatedness. The main effect of Relatedness was significant for participants (  F1   = 4.43,   P   = 0.5, mean square error = 1850.1), indicating that the averaged correct response times were significantly faster for the related (813 msec, SEM = 25) than for the unrelated (843 msec, SEM = 29) condition. In contrast, the main effect Relatedness was not significant for items (  F  2 < 1). \n  \nReaction times to correctly answered trials \n    \nWe included the neutral condition into the experimental design to control for inhibition effects. Behavioral analyses of RTs of the related, unrelated, and neutral condition showed that we observed facilitation but not inhibition effects. Two-tailed paired   t  -tests revealed that the mean RT of the neutral condition (894 msec [SEM: 21 msec]) was significantly longer than the mean RTs of the related (  t   = 5.337,   P   < 0.001) and the unrelated conditions (  t   = 3.082,   P   < 0.001). \n\n\n##### Accuracy \n  \nThe error data (in %) are presented in Table  . Relatedness had no effect on errors   (   Fs   < 1). \n  \nTask accuracy: percentages of error \n    \n\n\n\n### Experiment 2 \n  \n#### Behavioral data obtained postscanning outside the MRI scanner \n  \nWe assessed accuracy rates for hits (old words correctly identified as \u201cold\u201d) and correct rejections (new words correctly classified as \u201cnew\u201d). The mean accuracy rates were 80% (SEM = 3%) for hits and 90% (SEM = 2%) for correct rejections. A significant positive correlation between hits and correct rejections (  r   = 0.56) was found. This correlation indicates that participants showing a high accuracy rate for hits, showed as well a high accuracy rate for correct rejections. \n\n\n#### Imaging data \n  \nAll results of the 2 \u00d7 2 full-factorial ANOVA and the conjunction analysis are based on whole-brain analyses surviving a significance threshold of   P   < 0.001 and represent clusters of at least 25 connected voxels. The 2 \u00d7 2 full-factorial ANOVA with the within-subject factor Relatedness and the between-subject factor Linguistic task revealed neural associative priming effects and Relatedness \u00d7 Linguistic task interactions. Comparing neural activity with respect to the factor Linguistic task, no differences were apparent at a significance threshold of   P   < 0.001. The conjunction analysis revealed that semantic categorization and silently thinking about a word's meaning activated an overlapping left-lateralized network of infero-temporal and inferior frontal brain areas. \n\n##### Neural associative priming \n  \nIn order to investigate which brain areas show neural associative priming effects independently of the factor Linguistic task, we contrasted the hemodynamic response of the unrelated with the related condition. Contrasts were assessed according to suppression of neural activity (activation of related trials < activation of unrelated trials) and to enhancement of neural activity (activation of related trials > activation of unrelated trials). We showed associative suppression effects in bilateral STG, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), in occipito-temporal brain areas such as the lingual and the parahiccocampal gyrus and in medial frontal brain areas (BA 6/BA 9). All brain regions showing neural associative priming effects are presented in Table  . Brain areas belonging to a priori ROIs; that is, brain regions usually involved during semantic processing as highlighted in the Introduction section (i.e., inferior and middle frontal regions, inferior parietal, middle, superior, and inferior temporal regions including the fusiform gyrus in both hemispheres) are marked in bold face. Brain areas showing neural associative suppression effects are shown in Figure  . Additionally, we present the mean contrast estimates for related compared to unrelated trials for the neural associative priming effects in the left and right STG. No associative enhancement effects were observed. A comparison of related and unrelated trials with the neutral condition was carried out to exclude that our data were affected by inhibition effects. Consistent with the behavioral data of Experiment 1, no inhibition effects (unrelated > neutral) were observed in relevant brain areas for semantic processing ( ). \n  \nBrain areas showing (A) neural associative suppression effects for both linguistic tasks, (B) linguistic task effects, and (C) Relatedness \u00d7 Linguistic task interactions \n      \nBrain areas showing neural associative suppression, that is significantly lower activation for related than for unrelated trials in native speakers of German (  n   = 36), independently of the linguistic task (  P   < 0.001 uncorrected). Mean contrast estimates (% signal change) for related (RL) compared to unrelated (UL) trials across participants are shown for the left and right superior temporal gyri (STG) for both tasks (semantic categorization [SC], silently thinking about a word's meaning [SilTh]). Error bars indicate the SEM. \n  \n\n##### Linguistic task effects \n  \nNo linguistic task effects could be observed in prefrontal brain areas. ROI analyses in the LIFG (a) active during semantic processing in a meta-analysis ( ; MNI coordinates:   x   = \u221244,   y   = 24,   z   = 4), and (b) showing a linguistic task effect in the Wright et al. ( ) study (MNI coordinates: \u221236, 33, \u221212) did not reveal task-specific activation, even at liberal significance thresholds of   P   < 0.005 (uncorrected). Consistently, no brain region was more active for semantic categorization compared to silently thinking about a word's meaning at the specified threshold of   P   < 0.001 (uncorrected) in the full-factorial ANOVA. In contrast, higher activation was observed in occipital and inferior parietal brain areas for silently thinking compared to semantic categorization (see Table   section B) at   P   < 0.001 (uncorrected). Note that the individual contrast estimates for the critical conditions subjected to group-level analysis were subtracted from the symbol condition, the visual, and in the case of semantic categorization, the motor response baseline condition. \n  \nBrain areas showing greater activation for the critical condition compared to the visual symbol baseline condition. (A) Brain areas showing overlapping activation for both tasks, (B) brain areas showing task activation for semantic categorization, and (C) for silently thinking about a word's meaning \n    \n\n##### Relatedness \u00d7 Linguistic task interaction \n  \nWe evaluated the Relatedness \u00d7 Linguistic task interaction by contrasting neural associative priming effects for semantic categorization with silently thinking about a word's meaning (i.e., Associative Suppression \u2013 semantic categorization > Associative Suppression \u2013 silently thinking about a word's meaning and vice versa). Relatedness \u00d7 Linguistic task interactions were revealed in the right (R) IFG and the cingulate gyrus (see, Table   section C). This effect was significant at the specified threshold of   P   < 0.001 uncorrected, but not at a significance level corrected for multiple comparisons at peak or cluster level. The Relatedness \u00d7 Linguistic task interaction in the RIFG and its mean contrast estimates are displayed in Figure  . \n  \nRight inferior frontal gyrus (RIFG) showing a Relatedness \u00d7 Linguistic task interaction in native speakers of German (  n   = 36) at   P   < 0.001 uncorrected. Mean contrast estimates (%) for related (RL) and unrelated (UL) trials across participants for semantic categorization (SC) and silently thinking about a word's meaning (SilTh) are displayed. Error bars indicate SEM. \n  \n\n##### Conjunction analysis \n  \nIn addition to the 2 \u00d7 2 full-factorial ANOVA, we computed a conjunction analysis across both tasks independently of the factor Relatedness. The conjunction analysis revealed overlapping task activation in a left-lateralized network consisting of occipito-temporal brain areas including the fusiform gyrus and inferior and middle frontal brain areas (Fig.  ). All the brain areas showing overlapping activation for semantic categorization and silently thinking about a word's meaning are reported in section A of Table  . In addition, we report the task activation ([Related + Unrelated] \u2013 Symbol) for semantic categorization and silently thinking about a word's meaning separately in sections B and C of Table  . \n  \nOverlapping task activation for semantic categorization and silently thinking about a word's meaning across critical conditions (related [RL], unrelated [UL]) compared to a visual baseline (A). Brain areas showing task activation for semantic categorization (B) and silently thinking about a word's meaning (C). \n  \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we investigated whether the neuroanatomical localization of neural associative priming effects within a fronto-parieto-temporal network thought to subserve semantic processing (for a review, see Price  ; Bookheimer  ; Wu et al.  ) differed with respect to the presence of a binary semantic decision process. In particular, we focused on the functional role of the LIFG in semantic decision making. Linguistic task demands were systematically manipulated with respect to a binary semantic decision process in two associative priming experiments designed to elicit automatic lexical processing by controlling the SOA and PRP (cf., De Groot  ; Balota and Lorch  ; Neely  ; McNamara and Holbrook  ). \n\nOur results provide a clear picture: the two semantic tasks activated the same left-lateralized fronto-temporal network, recruiting the fusiform gyrus, the cingulate cortex, the IFG, and MFG, irrespective of the presence of a binary decision component. No linguistic task effects could be observed in the LIFG. However, silently thinking about a word's meaning showed higher activation in inferior parietal brain areas compared to semantic categorization, but no brain area was more active for semantic categorization. Regarding associative priming effects, we found neural associative suppression effects in bilateral superior temporal brain areas, occipito-temporal, and medial frontal brain regions independently of the linguistic task. However, one brain area seemed to be selectively activated as a function of the binary decision process, namely the right IFG. At the behavioral level for semantic categorization, there was a significant 30-msec associative priming effect indicating that lexical access was facilitated (cf., Meyer and Schvaneveldt  ). No inhibition effects were observed as expected for experimental paradigms with short SOAs and low PRPs (cf., Neely  ). For silently thinking about a word's meaning, we observed high accuracy rates in the postscanning recognition-test with a significant positive correlation between hits and correct rejections emphasizing that participants did well process the critical words. \n\n### Neural associative suppression effects \n  \nObservation of neural associative suppression effects in a fronto-temporal network across both tasks indicates that semantic processing was facilitated for related compared to unrelated word pairs (Copland et al.  ; Wheatley et al.  ; Gold et al.  ). In the present research, the neuroanatomical activation pattern of associative suppression effects in frontal and temporal brain areas is in line with the assumption that semantic processing necessitates that prefrontal brain regions interact with temporal brain regions (cf., Roskies et al.  ). We propose that the neural associative suppression effect in the STG and MTG likely reflects facilitated lexical access of the second word of an associatively related word pair at the level of the mental lexicon (cf., Howard et al.  ; Fiebach et al.  ). Temporal brain areas are discussed as being involved in accessing, selecting, gating, or retrieving semantic information stored in lexical entries of the mental lexicon (Roskies et al.  ). Furthermore, the neural associative suppression effect observed in medial frontal brain areas (BA 6/BA 9) might reflect facilitated integration, control, and retrieval processes of semantic information that is necessary to activate semantic representations in the related compared to the unrelated condition. Activation of anterior prefrontal areas has previously been associated with integration of verbal information and control processes (e.g., Christoff and Gabrieli  ; Prabhakaran et al.  ), management of multiple task-relevant goals (e.g., Koechlin et al.  ), and memory retrieval processes (Tulving et al.  ; Schacter et al.  ; Lepage et al.  ; McDermott et al.  ). Regarding neural associative suppression in the ACC, we suggest that this effect might be related to the conflict arising in the unrelated critical condition compared to no conflict in the related condition. It is well known that the ACC is activated in conflicting situations (e.g., Botvinick et al.  ,  ; Kerns et al.  ). Thus, this effect is mainly related to nonlexical processes that are induced by the associative priming paradigm underlining that the paradigm worked very well. \n\n\n### Linguistic task effects \n  \nLinguistic task effects were found in inferior parietal regions with higher activation for silently thinking about a word's meaning compared to semantic decision making. We suggest that this difference might be due to the fact that silently thinking about a word's meaning led to a deeper analysis of semantic content like previously observed for explicit semantic tasks (cf., Kuperberg et al.  ; Ruff et al.  ). No brain area was more active for semantic decision making. In contrast to Wright et al. ( ), who showed linguistic task effects with respect to binary decision making (LDT vs. Passive listening) in the LIFG, we showed overlapping activation in occipito-temporal and inferior and middle frontal regions irrespective of the binary decision. This finding suggests that the whole fronto-temporal network including the LIFG is important for activating semantic content in general irrespective of linguistic task demands. In our study, activation of the LIFG with a task that did not involve a binary decision might be explained by the fact that a \u201cdeep\u201d semantic analysis was conducted. This could be due to the fact that we combined a paradigm favoring activation of the semantic representation of words, that is, associative priming, with a task that explicitly led the participants to deeply process the semantic properties of the words, that is, silently thinking about a word's meaning (cf., Ruff et al.  ). Our findings are consistent with previous lexical priming studies (semantic/repetition) showing neural responses related to lexical/semantic processing in the LIFG (Chee et al.  ; Wheatley et al.  ) with linguistic tasks that did not involve an overt behavioral response (silently activating the meaning of words/silent reading). Activation of the LIFG irrespective of linguistic task demands converges also with a previous study of Ruff et al. ( ), who failed to show a linguistic task effect (LDT vs. Semantic judgment) in the LIFG indicating that the LIFG is active independently of the explicit or implicit nature of a linguistic task. \n\nThis is the first study that directly compared the neural response related to semantic processing in two semantic tasks, which differed with respect to semantic decision making, assessed with a linguistic paradigm tapping into automatic lexical access. Unlike in previous studies, we are convinced that the participants analyzed the semantic properties of the target words in depths in both tasks underpinned (1) by associative suppression effects in brain areas typically active during semantic processing as the STG, (2) by behavioral associative priming effects for semantic categorization, and (3) by high-accuracy rates in a postscanning recognition-test for silently thinking about a word's meaning. Altogether, our experimental choices may have contributed to be able to capture activation in the LIFG and temporal brain areas with the two linguistic tasks. \n\nMoreover, we found a Task \u00d7 Relatedness interaction in the RIFG with associative suppression for semantic categorization but not for silently thinking about a word's meaning. This interaction may be related to decision making per se, independently of activating semantic content, which would be consistent with the general role of prefrontal brain areas in decision making. However, this effect was significant at the specified significance threshold, but not after correction for multiple comparisons. Conservative significance testing in fMRI analyses has been discussed as possibly increasing the risk of committing Type-II errors compared to Type-I errors in statistical inference (Lieberman and Cunningham  ). Thus, we suggest that the effect in the RIFG with a large cluster size of 40 voxels and a   t  -value of 4.22 is unlikely to represent a false positive. Further investigation should be conducted to disentangle the functional role of the left and right IFG in semantic processing. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nLeft-lateralized activation of temporal and inferior frontal brain areas irrespective of linguistic task demands call into question the role of the LIFG as center of semantic decision making (cf., Demb et al.  ; Fiez  ; Gabrieli et al.  ; Wagner et al.  ; Roskies et al.  ; Wu et al.  ). The present fMRI data lend support to the claim that the LIFG is involved in semantic content activation in general and not especially involved during semantic decision making. In contrast, the right IFG may play a role in decision making independently of semantic processing. Further investigation would be necessary to investigate the temporal structure of the involvement of the different parts of the fronto-temporal network involved during lexical access depending on the task demands. For this purpose, combined neurophysiological and neuroimaging methods will be fruitful to precise the neurodynamics of activation within this cortical network. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: tbl1\n### Label: Table 1\nExperimental condition\tPrime word\tTarget word\nRelated\tSaft (juice)\tFRUCHT (fruit)\nUnrelated\tAnzeige (announcement)\tFRUCHT (fruit)\n### Caption\nExamples of word pairs in the related and unrelated conditions\n### Footer\nEnglish translation equivalents are shown in brackets.\n\n\n## ID: tbl2\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0\tSubjects analysis (F1)\tItems analysis (F2)\nRelated\t813 (25)\t845 (16)\nUnrelated\t843 (29)\t864 (14)\nPriming effect\t30 (14)???\t19 (22)???\n### Caption\nReaction times to correctly answered trials\n### Footer\nMean reaction times (RTs; in milliseconds) for semantic categorization to target words in subjects and items analyses in each condition as well as priming effects (in milliseconds).

Our previous fMRI study demonstrated that amygdala reactivity was independently predicted by affective-cognitive styles (phobic prone or eating disorders prone) and genotype of the serotonin transporter in a discrimination task of fearful facial expressions. Since the insula is associated with the subjective evaluation of bodily states and is involved in human feelings, we explored whether its activity could also vary in function of individual differences. In the present fMRI study, the association between dispositional affects and insula reactivity has been examined in two groups of healthy participants categorized according to affective-cognitive styles (phobic prone or eating disorders prone). Images of the faces of partners and strangers, in both painful and neutral situations, were used as visual stimuli. Interaction analyses indicate significantly different activations in the two groups in reaction to a loved one's pain: the phobic prone group exhibited greater activation in the left posterior insula. These results demonstrate that affective-cognitive style is associated with insula activity in pain empathy processing, suggesting a greater involvement of the insula in feelings for a certain cohort of people. In the mapping of individual differences, these results shed new light on variability in neural networks of emotion. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAn important goal of integrating psychology and neuroimaging is to understand the detailed mechanisms mediating inter-individual differences in human behavior. Individual variability in emotion processing may be associated with genetic variations as well as with psychological predispositions  \u2013 . In order to refine the integration between genetics and psychology, more psychological tools would be useful in the attempt to grasp the complexity of human variability. Several authors consider the dispositional affect to be the predominant modality of emotional engagement with the self and with the environment  \u2013 . Our concept of dispositional affect developed based on previous works on the relationship between cognitive styles and attachment patterns  \u2013  in some psychopathological conditions  \u2013 . It emphasizes the need to account for the way in which each person, in dealing with others and the different circumstances of everyday life, feels situated in the environment  \u2013 . Within this new perspective, two general dispositional affects can be defined: primarily based on basic emotions or primarily based on emotions which are co-perceived through others (non-basic emotions)  \u2013 . Subjects with a better knowledge of basic emotions are said to have an inward disposition (not to be confounded with introversion-see below)  \u2013 ,  \u2013 . Inward subjects tend to be more viscerally aware, more sensitive in the detection of changes in bodily states occurring during emotions and feelings. In brief, their focus is primarily directed towards a frame of reference that predominantly uses a body-centered coordinate system  \u2013 . Subjects with a better knowledge of non-basic emotions, i. e. emotions that require some kind of relationship between the self and external points of reference, are said to have an outward disposition (not to be confounded with extraversion -see below)  \u2013 ,  . Outward subjects tend to be more externally aware, and in this sense, their focus is primarily directed towards a frame of reference that predominantly uses an externally-anchored coordinate system, i. e. contexts, people or rules and norms  \u2013 . \n\nDifferent dispositional affects could explain behavioral data on field-dependent or independent perceptual processing  , on independent or interdependent self-construal  ,  , as well as on variability of interoceptive sensitivity in emotional processing  \u2013 . \n\nWithin these two general dispositional affects, five categories are identified as affective-cognitive styles among which two are particularly orthogonal: 1) phobic prone individuals (inward), and 2) eating disorders prone individuals (outward). It is necessary to underline that the terms phobic prone and eating disorders prone do not necessarily imply that these subjects are at higher risk of pathological phobias or of eating disorders. Phobic prone individuals rely predominantly on basic emotions and are characterized by a sense of permanence of Self predominantly centered on the visceral reading of emotional states. The \u201chypercognition\u201d   of basic emotions (especially fear) plays a central role in the development and regulation of a stable perception of Self. In fact, the recurrent activation of basic emotions is matched by a subjective experience of \u201cgut feelings\u201d. As a result these individuals tend to regulate their relationship both with others and in accordance with the ongoing situations through bringing internal states into focus, thereby allowing their personal stability to coincide with the stability of their own bodily conditions (body-bounded sense of self). Therefore the bodily-emotional condition and its control (through various strategies) are centrally salient to these individuals in regulating their emotional life. On the other hand, eating disorders prone individuals are characterized by a sense of permanence of Self that emerges simultaneously and in tune with the perception of a source of meaning  ,  \u2013 . While this produces a recognition of one's own internal states stemming from a focus on the real or imagined other in ongoing situations  ,  \u2013 , at the same time the \u201coutward\u201d referent becomes the source of information (perceived as source of expectations, of judgment, of emulation or as a pole of opposition, of challenge, etc.) to recognize one's own emotional experience. In this regard, eating disorders prone individuals tend to be more socially aware and to regulate their personal stability on a coordinate system which is outwardly anchored to a real or imagined other. One effect of this situational and social interest is that those emotions which emerge through mediated affective engagement (non basic emotions) can change more easily -since they tax the system's visceral resources less\u2013 and with greater flexibility with regard to the flow of ongoing events. \n\nThe insula plays a key role in homeostatic afferent activity that engenders distinct subjective bodily feelings  , and it is involved in human feeling processing  \u2013 . Therefore, its reactivity could be associated with individual differences. Neuroimaging studies have provided evidence for the direct involvement of the insular cortex in the so-called \u201cpain matrix\u201d during empathy for pain  \u2013 . However, current debates on empathy have raised unanswered questions about individual differences  \u2013 . To our knowledge, no fMRI studies have been conducted previously with this objective. Therefore, the present study was carried out to determine whether and how individual differences in affective-cognitive styles are associated with insula reactivity during affective empathic responses to directly perceived feelings of others. \n\nWith this objective, two groups of healthy subjects were categorized according to their affective-cognitive style, phobic prone or eating disorders prone. In order to study the role of the affective-cognitive styles, salient visual stimuli depict a loved one, in both painful and neutral expressions. Unfamiliar faces were used as controls. We predicted greater insular cortex activity associated with the subjective evaluation of their condition   in the phobic prone subjects, because of their relatively greater focus on a body-centered coordinate system as a frame of reference. More precisely, we hypothesized that the activation of the insular cortices during a visual experience of a loved one's pain would differ according to group. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFifteen participants were phobic prone (PP) (6 females; mean age 39.2; standard deviation [SD] 7.4) and 15 were eating disorders prone (EDP) (5 females; mean age 34.4; standard deviation [SD] 8.65). The couples enrolled had been together in a committed relationship for the last three years and had been living together for at least one year. To assign the participants to a group, they were assessed with a semi-structured interview  \u2013  and the Personality Meaning Questionnaire (PMQ)   one month before the scanning session. Concordance between the two investigators was 100%. As in our previous study  \u2013 , the semi-structured interview was administered independently by two trained investigators who were blind to each other's results. The aim of the semi-structured interview was to assess the key themes characterizing different affective-cognitive styles in the matter of emotional activation, duration and regulation. The semi-structured interview was divided into three consecutive steps. The subject was asked to give a detailed account of two meaningful emotional experiences involving anger and fear. After the account, the interviewer marked the characteristics of the appraisal, regulation and duration of the emotional experiences. If necessary, the interviewer asked for more details and then, the interviewer assessed the underlying predominant affective-cognitive style. The PP key themes detected were the tendency a) to focus on the visceral bodily states once the basic emotions have been triggered (automatic appraisal), b) to have the subjective perception of inability to modify these emotions after they have been triggered (duration), c) to have control over bodily-emotional condition aimed at limiting the emotional intensity; fear in these subjects lasts just as long as the perception of not being in control (regulation). Instead, EDP key themes detected were the tendency a) to focus on the outward referent recognized as the source of one's own emotional states (reflective appraisal), b) to have the subjective perception of capability to rapidly change these emotions by modifying the simultaneous focus on a different point of reference (duration), c) to adjust their personal stability to the perceived source of reference; being without a point of reference is perceived by these subjects as a feeling of emptiness (regulation). The PMQ questions on which PP subjects tend to score higher identify a score of need for emotional over-control in situations that may be felt as potentially dangerous (PP score)  . The questions on which EDP subjects score higher identify a score for need for consent and approval, sensitivity to judgment, and vulnerability to criticism (EDP score)  . \n\nA behavioral evaluation of how subjects in each group processed empathy for pain was obtained through the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI)   comprised of four subtests which measure dispositional empathy based on the notion that empathy consists of a set of separate but related constructs. In order to support the behavioral characterization of each dispositional affect style in terms of body perception, we also employed two subtests of the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ)  : the \u201cAwareness of Bodily Processes\u201d (ABP) and the \u201cAutonomic Nervous System Reactivity\u201d (ANSR). The study was approved by the local IRB. Subjects also completed a series of questionnaires identifying different personality characteristics, such as the NEO Five Factors Inventory  , the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI)  , the Positive and Negative Attitude Scale (PANAS)  , the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI)  , and the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ)  . Other demographic variables included years of education, parental socioeconomic status  , total IQ (assessed with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised [WAIS-R]), and handedness   ( ). Exclusion criteria included a history of drug or alcohol abuse, previous head trauma with loss of consciousness, pregnancy, and any significant medical or psychiatric conditions as evaluated with the SCID interview. \n   Questionnaire Scores for Phobic prone and Eating disorders prone Groups.        \n\n### Ethics statement \n  \nThe present study was approved by the Comitato Etico Indipendente Locale of the Azienda Ospedaliera \u201cOspedale Policlinico Consorziale\u201d of Bari. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants before participation. \n\n\n### Functional MRI data \n  \nfMRI data were acquired on a 3T GE (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) MRI scanner with a gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence and covered 26 axial slices (5 mm thick, 1 mm gap), encompassing the entire cerebrum and most of the cerebellum (TR 2; field of view, 24 cm; matrix, 64\u00d764, a voxel size of 3.75\u00d73.75\u00d75 mm). For each scan, a total of 330 EPI volume images were acquired. \n\n\n### Visual Stimuli \n  \nVisual stimuli consisted of 160 pictures (720\u00d7576 pixels), 40 for each condition, depicting faces of a loved one and of actors, in both painful and neutral situations. Two professional actors, a female and a male, were enrolled as models for the pictures of unfamiliar faces ( ). Facial expressions of actors and partners were filmed in a session previous to scanning. Painful facial expressions were elicited by mechanical stimuli during a pain threshold test. Two investigators reviewed the videotaped recordings and selected by consensus the picture frames conveying evidence of the intensity of the experience of pain, based on Ekman and Friesen's Facial Action Coding System (FACS)  . \n   Sample of visual stimuli: actors' neutral and painful facial expression.    \n\n### General fMRI Procedures \n  \nFunctional MRI scanning consisted of one run in an event-related design. To optimize the stimulus sequence, we used a genetic algorithm  . The exact timing of the occurrence of each event was generated with the genetic algorithm, using an average inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 1300 ms, equal numbers of on and off events, and optimization for hemodynamic response detection. Visual stimuli were presented for 1400 ms in a random order. During the interstimulus interval (ISI), a crosshair was presented. Total run time was about 11.2 minutes. Visual stimuli were presented using Presentation 10.5 ( ). During the scanning session participants were required to perform a discrimination task between known and unknown faces, in both painful and neutral situations. Responses were given via a button box which recorded accuracy (i. e. percent correct responses) and reaction time (measured in milliseconds). Before the scanning session, each participant completed the STAI questionnaire   to evaluate their state of anxiety. After scanning, participants were asked to rate the intensity of others' pain and of their own feelings of unpleasantness on the basis of the same visual stimuli by using a computerized visual analogue scale (VAS) with target words ranging from \u201cno pain\u201d to \u201cextreme pain\u201d and from \u201cno effect\u201d to \u201cextreme unpleasantness\u201d. Participants were not informed of their partners' role in the study before the scanning session. \n\n\n### Image analysis \n  \nImages were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM5 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK), implemented in MatLab 7.2 (MathWorks\u2122). For each subject, functional images were first slice-timing corrected, using the middle slice acquired in time as a reference, and then spatially corrected for head movement, using a least-squares approach and six-parameter rigid body spatial transformations. They were then normalized into a standard stereotactic space (Montreal Neurological Institute MNI template) by using a 12-parameter affine model and spatially smoothed with a three-dimensional Gaussian filter (10 mm full-width at half-maximum). \n\nImages were analyzed using a standard random-effect procedure. The time series of functional MR images obtained from each participant were analyzed separately. The effect of the experimental paradigm was estimated on a voxel-by-voxel basis, according to the general linear model extended to allow the analysis of fMRI data as time series. Low-frequency noise was removed with a high-pass filter (time constant 128 s). The onset of each trial constituted a neural event that was modeled through a canonical hemodynamic response function, chosen to represent the relationship between neural activation and hemodynamic changes. Serial correlation in the fMRI time series was estimated with a restricted maximum likelihood (ReML) algorithm using an autoregressive AR(1) model during parameter estimation, assuming the same correlation structure for each voxel. The ReML estimates were then used to whiten the data. These subject-specific models were used to compute four contrast images per subject (partner's neutral face, partner's painful face, unknown neutral face, unknown painful face), each representing the estimated amplitude of the hemodynamic response in one experimental condition. Contrast images from all subjects of the two groups (inward and outward) were entered at the second level into a random-effects model repeated-measures 2\u00d72\u00d72 ANOVA with non-sphericity correction (as implemented in SPM5). For interaction analyses and direct comparisons of the two groups a 2\u00d72\u00d72 factorial design was used: a group factor (inward-outward), a painful facial expressions factor (painful-neutral faces) and a \u201cfamiliar\u201d facial expressions (partner's-unfamiliar faces). Across all analyses, the statistical threshold was set at p<0.001 uncorrected with an extent threshold of 8 contiguous voxels. Fisher's LSD test was used for post-hoc comparisons. All MNI coordinate spaces were converted to the Talairach coordinate system by icbm2tal ( ).Anatomic and Brodmann's areas labeling of the activity of clusters was performed with the Talairach Daemon database ( ). \n\nIn order to investigate signal intensity of BOLD responses, regions-of-interests (ROIs) were defined as spheres with 6 mm diameter centered at the peak voxel in the activated clusters identified in the 3-way interaction analysis. The parameter estimates of signal intensity in ROIs were computed from the first-level analysis in each participant and successively compared with a repeated measures ANOVA, with four facial expressions as within-effect factors and with dispositional affects as between-subjects factors. \n\nIn order to evaluate any differences between groups for VAS ratings intensity of the others' pain and of their own feelings of unpleasantness, a 2\u00d72\u00d72 factorial design was used with the group factor (PP-EDP), pain factor (painful-neutral faces) and familiarity factor (partner's-unknown faces). T tests were used to verify any difference s between groups due to the familiarity factor in VAS ratings of the intensity of others' pain and of their own feelings of unpleasantness. T tests were employed to evaluate any differences between groups in questionnaires. Repeated measures ANOVAs with dispositional affects as the between-subjects factor were carried out to analyze any differences in reaction time and performance accuracy. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographics and questionnaires \n  \nT tests and \u03c7  indicated that the two groups of subjects were well matched for age, gender, parental education and years of education (all p>0.2). T tests of the IRI scores only revealed a significant difference between groups for one subtest, \u201cPerspective Taking\u201d (PT), which measures the reported tendency to spontaneously adopt the psychological point of view of others in everyday life (t-value \u200a=\u200a\u22123.65 df\u200a=\u200a28 p<0,001): the EDP group had higher PT scores than the PP group ( ). Interestingly, subjects in the PP group had higher scores than outward subjects for the \u201cAwareness of bodily processes\u201d (ABP) subtest (t-value \u200a=\u200a2.6 df\u200a=\u200a28 p<0.03) ( ). These results provide evidence that the two groups have different questionnaire response rates: the PP group was more likely to be aware of bodily processes and a less prone to adopt another's point of view, whereas the opposite tendency was seen in the EDP group, i.e. more likely to adopt another's point of view and less likely to be aware of bodily processes. T tests of the other questionnaires did not indicate any significant difference between groups (df\u200a=\u200a28; NEO: t-value\u200a=\u200a0.5 p>0.62; TCI: t-value\u200a=\u200a1.67 p>0.11; PANAS: t-value\u200a=\u200a1.4 p>0.17; EPI: t-value\u200a=\u200a0.8 p>0.4; BFQ: t-value\u200a=\u200a1.96 p>0.06), suggesting that the two groups of subjects did not significantly differ on other aspects of personality identified by these questionnaires ( ). \n\nOn the other hand, the VAS ratings ANOVA revealed that no significant interactions occurred between the group factor, pain factor and familiarity factor, in both the evaluation of pain intensity in others and in the personal experience of unpleasantness when observing others' pain. No significant differences due to the familiarity factor were found between groups in VAS ratings of the intensity of others' pain or in participants' own feelings of unpleasantness. \n\nIn addition, in a repeated measures ANOVA with the dispositional affects factor as the between-subjects factor showed no differences between the two groups in terms of reaction time and performance accuracy. \n\n\n### Neuroimaging Results \n  \nFirst of all, the main effects of pain, familiarity and affective-cognitive style factors were investigated. Observing pain in others (painful faces>neutral faces) caused activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal gyrus (BA 46) (DLPFC), left cerebellum and right red nucleus (p<0.001 uncorrected) ( ). In contrast, the main effect of the familiarity factor [partner's faces>unknown faces] was associated with activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA9), the right medial prefrontal cortex (BA10) and the left posterior cingulate cortex (BA31) (p<0.001 uncorrected) ( ). Previous studies have found these same areas to be involved in cognitive and emotional processing of pain empathy and familiarity. The main effect of the affective-cognitive style was interesting to observe, as the group factor produced a significant effect. Indeed, activity in the left posterior insula (BA13) and the right parietal lobe (BA40) (SI) (p<0.001 uncorrected) was greater in the PP group; whereas in the EDP group, the BOLD response was greater in the bilateral DLPFC (BA9), bilateral precuneus (BA7) and left posterior cingulate cortex (BA23) (PCC) (p<0.001 uncorrected) ( ,  ). Interestingly, in the PP group, greater activation was seen in those areas usually involved in the bodily states, even though no real bodily experience was administered. \n   3D rendering (image threshold at p<0.05 FWE corrected) of the BOLD response of the main effects of group factor.  \nSignificant activation: INWARD: left posterior insula BA13, and the right parietal lobe SII BA40; OUTWARD: bilateral DLPFC BA9, bilateral precuneus BA7. 2-D overlay with multiple slices of insular activation in each group. \n     Main effects of pain and familiarity factors p<0.001 uncorrected, k\u200a=\u200a8.           Inter-group comparisons p<0.001 uncorrected, k\u200a=\u200a8.        \nAt this point, the three-way interaction between affective-cognitive style, the observed facial expression, and the familiarity of the face was explored. This interaction demonstrated differential activity in the left insula (BA13) (x\u200a=\u200a\u221241 y\u200a=\u200a\u22124 z\u200a=\u200a10) at a more lenient threshold (p<0.01) ( ). Moreover, the interaction also indicated differential activity in left precuneus (BA31) (x\u200a=\u200a\u221226 y\u200a=\u200a\u221271 z\u200a=\u200a35; p<0.001) ( ) and in the right mPFC (BA10) (x\u200a=\u200a11 y\u200a=\u200a60 z\u200a=\u200a\u22125; p<0.001) ( ,  ). ANOVA analyses of parameter estimates from these clusters indicated greater activity in the left insula for the PP group during processing of partners' painful expressions and of strangers' neutral expressions. On the other hand, in the EDP group, the left precuneus was more engaged and the right mPFC (BA10) was less deactivated during processing of partners' painful expressions and of strangers' neutral expressions ( ). This finding suggests that a significant correlation was present between the group factor and the differences observed among the participants. \n   Left insula with significantly greater activation in the inward group, obtained with the the 3-way interaction analyses, identified at p<0.001 uncorrected, Ke\u200a=\u200a8 voxels.  \n a  ) the left posterior insula (peak coordinates x\u200a=\u200a\u221241, y\u200a=\u200a\u22124, z\u200a=\u200a10; p<0.01 uncorrected, Ke\u200a=\u200a8 voxels);   b  ) the left precuneus (peak coordinates x\u200a=\u200a\u221226, y\u200a=\u200a\u221271, z\u200a=\u200a35);   c  ) the right medial PFC (peak coordinates x\u200a=\u200a11, y\u200a=\u200a60, z\u200a=\u200a\u22125).

Bars depict variance loadings and 90% confidence intervals. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study investigated the relationship between affective-cognitive styles and insula reactivity during affective empathic responses to the directly perceived feelings of others. \n\nFor this purpose, visual stimuli depicting partners' and unknown faces, in both painful and neutral situations, were presented to two groups of healthy participants, categorized according to their affective-cognitive style, inward (phobic prone) or outward (eating disorders prone). \n\nThe results suggest that affective-cognitive style is associated with differential insula reactivity to painful facial expressions. Imaging data revealed that the involvement of the insular region was quantitatively different in these two groups of healthy subjects categorized according to their affective-cognitive styles. Interaction analyses demonstrated that different brain regions were more involved in each group, particularly while processing partners' painful facial expressions. Indeed, in PP subjects, more activation was seen in the left posterior insula, whereas EDP subjects had greater engagement in the left precuneus and mPFC. \n\nUp to the present, several studies have provided results that assign a key role to the insula during the direct experience of pain and during a vicarious experience of another person's pain  \u2013 ,  \u2013 . These studies significantly contributed to the development of the current topic concerning insular cortex engagement in emotions  \u2013 . Concerning the individual differences issue in pain empathy  \u2013 , our results suggest that dispositional affects act upon the neural regions that subserve the ability to appreciate others' pain. At least two conclusions can be drawn from this fact. First, the role played by the insular cortex in the affective response to others' pain is central for a certain cohort of people. Secondly, the engagement of the insula in emotional experiences is modulated by dispositional affects. \n\nA primary interoceptive representation of the physiological condition of the body has been shown to exist in the posterior insular cortex  ,  \u2013 ; thereby it is involved in human feelings  \u2013 . As suggested by Craig's studies, a phylogenetically new homeostatic afferent pathway from lamina I, through the thalamus, to the posterior insular cortex provides a direct representation of homeostatic afferent activity that engenders distinct bodily feelings such as pain and visceral sensations  ,  . Thus, it seems that the regions with more activity in the PP group engage first-order mapping structures like the posterior insula and the somatosensory cortex/SI- recipients of signals from the internal milieu and the viscera  ,  ,  \u2013 . These results are consistent with the theoretical construct of inwardness described by our model  \u2013 . As they are more aware of the changes in bodily states occurring during emotions and feelings, these subjects had greater involvement of an area such as the posterior insula associated with regulating bodily states. \n\nIn contrast, the EDP group had greater activation in fronto-posterior parietal areas, such as the medial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus, while processing partners' painful facial expressions. The role of the precuneus has been demonstrated in processing self-relevant contextual information  \u2013 , in attention tracking  \u2013 , and in attentional non spatial shifts  . On the other hand, the mPFC/BA10 as a whole plays a role in self-referential processing  ,  \u2013  and social cognition  ,  . It has also been suggested that the mPFC/BA10 influences the attentional balance between self-generated and perceptual information, rather than being exclusively involved in processing self-generated information  . Thus, the precuneus (and interconnected posterior cingulate) and medial prefrontal cortices are engaged in continuous information gathering and representation of the self and the external world (\u201cco-perception\u201d), as well as in the assessment of self-relevant sensations  \u2013 ,  ,  \u2013 . Such results seem to be consistent with our model's of outwardness, as these subjects preferentially use an externally-anchored coordinate system as a reference frame during emotions and feelings. \n\nThe greater response in the left insula in the PP group to unfamiliar neutral faces, and in the left precuneus and right mPFC in the EDP group, could be related to the processing of the emotional significance of ambiguous stimuli when making a judgment  . This speculation is supported by the observation that both groups had similar BOLD responses. \n\nThe activation of different regions for the two groups cannot be attributed to dispositional variables such as sensitivity to pain expression: the two groups did not differ in their ratings of the intensity of pain in others or in their personal feelings of unpleasantness when observing others' pain. Moreover, behavioral data support the inter-group differences: PP subjects scored higher on indexes of internal body perceptions on the on the \u201cAwareness of Bodily Processes\u201d questionnaire  , while EDP subjects scored higher on indexes of \u201cPerspective Taking\u201d questionnaire  . \n\nIt is interesting to note that our results are in line with those of Critchley's study   which used a synchronized or desynchronized heartbeat tone signal in contrast with a series of ten similarly timed tones that either did or did not include an oddball tone. In this study, the interaction between desynchronized timing and interoceptive attention highlighted several regions including the precuneus and posterior insula. These regions are directly involved in interoceptive attention and exteroceptive attention. Interestingly, the engagement of the precuneus was greater when one person was in a painful situation caused by another individual, that is to say, when attention was focused on the social context  . \n\nOne limitation of this study was the insula sub-threshold activation reached in the interaction analysis. It should be viewed in the context of the significant main effect of the group factor. \n\nIn conclusion, all these findings indicate that affective-cognitive styles play a key role in explaining individual differences in insula reactivity when observing partners' painful facial expressions. As predicted, during cerebral processing of emotions, imaging in the PP group demonstrated a greater engagement of the posterior insula, which is involved in mapping of internal bodily and subjective feeling states.

{"text": "Li, Baojuan and Friston, Karl J. and Liu, Jian and Liu, Yang and Zhang, Guopeng and Cao, Fenglin and Su, Linyan and Yao, Shuqiao and Lu, Hongbing and Hu, Dewen\nSci Rep, 2014\n\n# Title\n\nImpaired Frontal-Basal Ganglia Connectivity in Adolescents with Internet Addiction\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nUnderstanding the neural basis of poor impulse control in Internet addiction (IA) is important for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of this syndrome. The current study investigated how neuronal pathways implicated in response inhibition were affected in IA using a Go-Stop paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-three control subjects aged 15.2 \u00b1 0.5 years (mean \u00b1 S.D.) and eighteen IA subjects aged 15.1 \u00b1 1.4 years were studied. Effective connectivity within the response inhibition network was quantified using (stochastic) dynamic causal modeling (DCM). The results showed that the indirect frontal-basal ganglia pathway was engaged by response inhibition in healthy subjects. However, we did not detect any equivalent effective connectivity in the IA group. This suggests the IA subjects fail to recruit this pathway and inhibit unwanted actions. This study provides a clear link between Internet addiction as a behavioral disorder and aberrant connectivity in the response inhibition network. \n \n\n# Body\n \nInternet addiction (IA) is described as \u201cproblematic Internet use\u201d  or \u201cpathological Internet use\u201d  and refers to the inability to control the use of the Internet . IA has become more prevalent over recent years. Previous studies suggest that Internet addiction is found in individuals from different areas and backgrounds . The prevalence of Internet addiction varies from 5.4% in Italy  to 18.3% in Britain . IA has been reported to lead to academic, social, and occupational impairment . Furthermore, the levels of loneliness , depression , compulsivity  and suicide ideation  are higher in Internet addiction relative to control subjects. In particular, problems are more commonly reported by younger and more recent Internet users . \n\nA significant and interesting finding is that IA is associated with poor impulse control . Individuals with IA usually use the Internet compulsively , despite adverse consequences; show diminished control over Internet use, and feel a great urge to be \u2018online\u2019 when disconnected . An early study reported that problematic Internet use of all twenty subjects studied met DSM-IV criteria for an impulse control disorder (ICD) not otherwise specified . Similarly, Treuer and co-authors  found that the prevalence of ICD features is high among Internet users and we have noted that adolescents with IA exhibit more impulsivity than controls . Based on these findings, it has been argued that IA may represent a subset of ICD . Understanding the neural basis underlying poor impulse control in IA subjects may therefore be of great importance for the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder. \n\nRecently, there has been increasing interest in investigating the neurobiological mechanisms of IA using neuroimaging . These studies have revealed lower gray matter density , reduced orbitofrontal cortical thickness , abnormal white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) , impaired brain activity , and decreased functional connectivity  in individuals with IA. In particular, studies performed by Dong and colleagues have demonstrated altered brain activity that was associated with less efficient impulse inhibition in IA subjects . Lower NoGo-N2 amplitude, higher NoGo-P3 amplitude, and longer NoGo-P3 peak latency were detected in the IA group during a Go/NoGo task . In addition, significantly greater activity in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex was found in IA subjects using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) . \n\nConvergent findings from previous studies indicate that impulsive responses are inhibited by engaging frontal-basal ganglia pathways involving the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) , the striatum , the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) , and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) ; yet little is known about how these response inhibition pathways are affected in IA. We used stochastic dynamic causal modeling (DCM) \u2013 a technique that measures the directed (effective) connectivity among brain regions \u2013 to characterize a network including the IFG, striatum and pre-SMA in healthy subjects and IA adolescents while performing Go-Stop task. As a behavioral measure of impulsivity, this task assesses the capacity to inhibit a response that has already been initiated. Three hypotheses were tested: 1) IA subjects would show impaired response inhibition during the Go-Stop task; 2) the frontal-basal ganglia pathways would be disrupted in IA; 3) impaired response inhibition would be associated with abnormal information flow in the frontal-basal ganglia pathways. \n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral performance \n  \nThe IA group showed impaired response inhibition during the Go-Stop task ( ). The percentage of successfully inhibited responses was significantly lower in the IA group than the controls during a 50\u2005ms delay task (p<0.05). However, when the task became harder, both groups demonstrated difficulty withholding their response. Although the control group performed better during the 150\u2005ms and 250\u2005ms delay tasks, the differences did not reach significance (p<0.05). \n\n\n### Conventional fMRI \n  \nConventional fMRI analysis (using statistical parametric mapping) revealed that the response inhibition network, including the right IFG, the right striatum and the left pre-SMA were activated in the control group, when the subjects tried to inhibit their responses ( ,  ). The right IFG and striatum survived small volume correction:   p  <0.05, FWE corrected. In contrast, only the left superior frontal gyrus, the left and the right striatum were activated during response inhibition in the IA subjects ( ,  ). Two-sample   t   tests (at the group level) showed that activations in bilateral IFG and the right striatum were weaker in the IA group compared to the control group ( ,  ). This cluster survived correction at p<0.05 for a small volume correction. On the other hand, we observed increased activation of the left superior frontal gyrus in the IA group ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Effective connectivity \n  \nSignificant connections at the group level (one-sample   t  -test at p<0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons) are shown in  . In all subjects, V2 exerted a significant positive influence on the activity of the pre-SMA. However, the connectivity between the IFG and the pre-SMA, between the pre-SMA and the striatum, and from the IFG to the striatum was only significant in the control group ( ). Conversely, the effective connectivity from the pre-SMA to V2 was only significant in the IA group ( ). \n\nFinally, we calculated the correlation between behavioral performance and the strength of the connections. We found a positive correlation between the strength of the connection from the IFG to the striatum and the percentage of successfully inhibited responses during the 150\u2005ms and 250\u2005ms delay tasks in all subjects. The behavioral performance was also negatively correlated with the strength of the connection from V2 to the pre-SMA, from the IFG to the pre-SMA, and from the pre-SMA to the IFG ( ). These results provide a behavioral validation of the quantitative effective connectivity estimates based purely upon the fMRI data. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of the present study was to investigate how neural pathways underlying response inhibition were affected in IA using a Go-Stop paradigm. Our results showed that core brain regions in the response inhibition network \u2013 including the IFG and the striatum \u2013 exhibited stronger activation in the control group than in the IA group. Crucially, a DCM analysis revealed directed connectivity between the frontal cortex and the striatum that was consistent (significant) in control subjects. However, we did not detect any significant effective connectivity between regions in the frontal-basal ganglia pathways in the IA group. These findings suggest that abnormalities in the neural pathways in the fronto-basal ganglia system underlie behavioral response inhibition in the IA group. \n\nIn this study, we found that the percentage of successfully inhibited responses was significantly lower in the IA group, suggesting impaired response inhibition in IA adolescents. This result is in line with previous studies that reported poor impulse control in IA . Moreover, conventional fMRI analysis detected reduced activation of the bilateral IFG and the right striatum in the IA group during response inhibition. Convergent findings from human studies have suggested that the right IFG is crucial for response inhibition . Brain activations in this region have been shown to be correlated with successful inhibitory control . Patients with lesions of the right frontal lobe needed more time to suppress a response than controls. Furthermore, IFG damage is also associated with stop signal reaction time (SSRT) . Stimulation of the IFG impaired the ability to inhibit an action . Considering the critical role of the right IFG in response inhibition, hypoactivation of this region may account for the poor impulse control observed in our study and previous studies of IA subjects . \n\nNeurobiologically, response inhibition has been suggested to be mediated via the indirect and the hyperdirect basal ganglia pathways . The hyperdirect pathway is thought to rapidly suppress a response through a projection from the frontal cortex to the STN . In contrast, the indirect pathway is thought to be slower, because it has more synapses than the hyperdirect pathway . In the indirect pathway, cortical outputs are first sent to the striatum. Neuronal signals are then passed to the globus pallidus pars externa and, finally, the STN. \n\nBecause we did not detect significant activation of the STN during response inhibition, this region was not included in our DCM \u2013 and thus we did not assess the integrity of the hyperdirect pathway. However, our results provide evidence for a key role of the indirect pathway in response inhibition. Our DCM results support the notion that when a stop signal is presented, the sensory input is relayed to the frontal cortex through a connection from V2 to the pre-SMA. The pre-SMA then communicates with the IFG via bidirectional connections. Finally, the IFG sends a stop command to the striatum to suppress the unwanted response. \n\nThe results of the DCM analysis are in line with findings from recent effective connectivity studies that also implicate the indirect pathway in suppressing responses . Using a novel method (ancestral graphs), Jahfari and co-authors found that the indirect pathway between the cortex and the caudate played an important role in response inhibition. They also noted that higher connection strengths between the cortex and the caudate were associated with more efficient response inhibition . Findings from effective connectivity studies are supported by studies using tractography data . A projection between the IFG and pre-SMA is consistently reported in these studies . Fiber tracts connecting the striatum with the inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis (IFGoper) were also reported in a recent diffusion tensor imaging study . Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have shown similar results : stimulation of the IFG was found to increase right striatal activation, implicating the indirect pathway in reactive inhibition . \n\nOne of the main contributions of this study is the detection of aberrant effective connectivity within the response inhibition network in IA. In contrast to control subjects, consistent directed connectivity between the IFG and the pre-SMA, between the pre-SMA and the striatum, and from the IFG to the striatum were not detected in the IA group, suggesting a failure to recruit the indirect pathway to suppress unwanted actions in Internet addiction. \n\nOur hypotheses were further verified by the association between connection strengths and subjects\u2019 performance during the Go-Stop task. Stronger IFG-striatum connections are associated with more successful response inhibition. This makes perfect sense: according to the DCM analysis, the connection strength describes the strength of a coupling in terms of the rate at which neuronal responses are elicited in the target region (in other words connection strengths are effectively rate constants in 1/s, Hz) . Thus a larger connection strength suggests a faster effect on the target region, resulting in more efficient termination of the action. In contrast, lower IFG-striatum connection strengths in the IA subjects represent slower suppressing of the responses through the indirect pathway, leading to failures in inhibiting responses. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nTwenty-eight adolescents with IA \u2013 as diagnosed by the modified Young's Diagnostic Questionnaire (YDQ) for Internet Addiction  \u2013 and 27 well-matched healthy subjects participated in this study. The IA subjects were outpatients of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University while the controls were recruited from high schools in Changsha. All subjects (and one of their parents) received a structured clinical interview from two experienced psychiatrists, which was based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). None of the participants in this study fulfilled any DSM-IV axis I disorders. Four healthy adolescents and 8 IA subjects were excluded from this study due to a failure to record behavioral data during the Go-Stop task. In addition, two IA subjects were removed from further analyses due to excessive head motion. Finally, 23 controls and 18 IA subjects were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences between the two groups in age (mean \u00b1 S.D., IA: 15.1 \u00b1 1.4 years versus control: 15.2 \u00b1 0.5 years), ethnicity or education ( , p<0.05, two-sample   t   test). All subjects' caretakers gave written informed consents. The study was conducted according to the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China. \n\nYDQ is a questionnaire proposed by Young to diagnose Internet addiction based on the DSM-IV criteria for pathological gambling . YDQ consists of eight criteria ( ). Young asserted that those who fulfill five or more of the eight criteria should be considered Internet-dependent. The initial Young's YDQ criteria were later modified by Beard and Wolf . They recommended that only those who met all of the first five criteria and at least one of the last three criteria should be considered Internet-dependent. The modified YDQ was used in the present study for the diagnosis of IA. \n\n\n### The Go-Stop Task \n  \nAs shown in   this study used a block design. The scanning session began with a 70 s period of the Go-Stop task, which was followed by rest block that lasted for 20\u2005s. The word \u2018rest\u2019 was fixated during the rest block, which was then followed by another task block. Rest and task blocks were repeated six times in each experiment and the scanning session lasted 9\u2005min. \n\nGo-Stop is a paradigm developed to assess the capacity to inhibit a response that has already been initiated. It requires participants to response to a series of five-digit numbers presented in black on a white background. There are three trial types: no-stop, stop and novel trials ( ). Participants are told to response with a button press to a number that is identical to the previous number presented in black, and this is a no-stop trial. A stop trial presents a number that matches the one before it, but it changes unpredictably from black to red at some specified stimulus onset asynchrony (50, 150, 250, or 350\u2005ms) after stimulus onset. No button is pressed during a stop trial. Novel trials present randomly generated non-matching numbers in black. In the current study, the intervals (50, 150, 250, or 350\u2005ms) \u2013 during which the target remained black (no-stop) before turning red (stop) \u2013 occurred with equal probability. Number stimuli were presented on the screen for 500\u2005ms once every 2\u2005s. The participants were instructed to response to a no-stop trial before the number disappeared from the screen but withhold response to a stop trial or novel trial . \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nA PHILIPS 3.0T whole-body scanner was used for acquiring the functional MRI images. A T2*-weighted gradient-echo EPI sequence (TR/TE = 2000/30\u2005ms, 4\u2005mm slice thickness, typically 36 axial slices, 64 \u00d7 64 matrix size, 24 \u00d7 24\u2005cm FOV, 90\u00b0-flip angle) was used to measure blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses. \n\n\n### Data preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing of the fMRI data used SPM8 ( ). First, a six-parameter rigid body transformation (three rotations, and three translations) was used to realign the functional images to the first image of each session. Then images were normalized to a MNI EPI template with affine registration followed by a nonlinear transformation, using a voxel size of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2\u2005mm. Finally, an 8-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel was used to smooth the data. \n\n\n### Statistical parametric mapping \n  \nSubject-specific responses were modeled using a general linear model (GLM) and standard (statistical parametric mapping) procedures: No-stop, stop and novel trials were modeled after convolution with a canonical hemodynamic basis function. The six motion parameters were included to model the movement correlated effects. In the first-level (within subject) analyses, we determined the contrast \u201cstop>baseline\u201d, which allowed us to identify brain regions that were activated or deactivated when the subject tried to inhibit responses. The resulting contrast images were then entered into the second-level (between-subject) analyses. Statistical parametric maps based on one-sample   t  -tests were used to illustrate brain activation during response inhibition for each group, while two-sample   t  -tests were performed to determine group differences of brain activation in the Go-Stop task. As this study focused on the response inhibition network, small volume correction was employed to a priori regions of interest: the IFG, striatum and pre-SMA. Sphere ROIs (radius = 25\u2005mm) centered at peak coordinates as reported by Aron et al.  were constructed. \n\n\n### Dynamic causal modeling \n  \nEffective connectivity analysis was performed using DCM12. The basic idea behind DCM is to treat the brain as a dynamic input-state-output system that is driven by experimental inputs and produces outputs (BOLD responses). Each region has a (hidden) neuronal state corresponding to neuronal or synaptic activity and four (hidden) hemodynamic states representing a vasodilatory signal, blood flow, blood volume and deoxyhemoglobin content. At the neuronal level, the neuronal state equations describe how neuronal activity in one region is affected by neuronal activity in others and how these influences are modulated by experimental inputs. The neuronal state equations are supplemented with the hemodynamic state equations that transform the neuronal activity in each region to observed BOLD response . \n\nIn this study, we used stochastic DCM. Stochastic DCM differs from conventional deterministic DCM by allowing for endogenous or random fluctuations in unobserved (hidden) neuronal and physiological states, known technically as system or state-noise . Compared to deterministic DCM, stochastic DCM has been shown to provide more accurate parameter estimates . Moreover, stochastic DCM can be used to study effective connectivity between brain regions in the resting state by exploiting spontaneous fluctuations in activity to estimate effective connectivity . \n\nIn order to reduce the model complexity, we concatenated the three inputs (the no-stop, stop and novel trials) to one input for the DCM analysis. In this case, we performed a GLM analysis with regressor for the task condition and six regressors represented the movement effects. For each subject, we determined the contrast \u201ctask>rest\u201d. \n\nBased on the group analysis \u2013 and on previous studies of the neural network associated with response inhibition \u2013 three ROIs were defined: the right IFG, the right striatum, and the left pre-SMA. Because subjects responded to visual stimuli (i.e., a series of five-digit numbers in black on a white background), activity within the motor system can be assumed to be driven by the visual system. Thus, we added a fourth region or node (V2) to our model. Because we did not detect significant activation of the STN during response inhibition in the subjects, this region was not included in the DCM. Subject-specific ROIs were centered on the local maximum of SPMs testing for \u201ctask minus rest\u201d. For some subjects, the locations of the ROIs were slightly adjusted to make sure the same ROI for each subject was located within the same anatomical gyrus as the group maximum. For the pre-SMA in one IA subject and the V2 in one healthy subject, the coordinates of the group maximum were used because we did not detect significant activation of the region in these subjects. The time series for all ROIs were extracted from a sphere region (radius = 6\u2005mm).   shows the locations and the time series of the four ROIs. \n\nFor the DCM analysis, a fully connected model was first constructed. Specifically, visual input was modeled as a driving or exogenous input to V2 and subject-specific DCMs were fully and reciprocally connected (resulting in 12 connections among four nodes). Given our primary interest was to detect differences in effective connectivity between the groups; we did not model any bilinear or modulatory effects. In other words, we estimated the average connectivity under the task-set of response inhibition, assuming that endogenous fluctuations in neuronal activity (state noise) would model condition specific responses. The full connected model for each subject was inverted using generalized filtering as described previously . A network discovery scheme was then used to identify the optimal model pooling over all subjects . Subject specific parameter estimates (posterior means) under the optimal model were then taken to the second, between-subject level analysis using a classical random-effects analysis. This allowed us to summarize the findings from the subject-specific DCMs at the group level, using classical statistics (  t  -tests). \n\n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nF.L.C., L.Y.S., D.W.H. and S.Q.Y. designed the project.

In the current study, we describe this connectivity and its dynamics during nociception with a novel analytical approach called Partial Similarity (PS). We developed PS specifically to estimate the communication between individual hubs of the network in contrast to the overall communication within that network. Partial Similarity works on trial-to-trial variance of neuronal activity acquired with functional magnetic resonance imaging. It discovers direct communication between two hubs considering the remainder of the network as confounds. A similar method to PS is Representational Similarity, which works with ordinary correlations and does not consider any external influence on the communication between two hubs. Particularly the combination of Representational Similarity and Partial Similarity analysis unravels brainstem dynamics involved in trigeminal pain using the spinal trigeminal nucleus (STN)\u2014the first relay station of peripheral trigeminal input\u2014as a seed region. The combination of both methods can be valuable tools in discovering the network dynamics in fMRI and an important instrument for future insight into the nature of various neurological diseases like primary headaches. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can identify hubs of neuronal networks and as such simultaneously activate areas specific to an investigated task, but allows little to no access to the connectivity within these networks and particularly no insights into their dynamic during tasks. Nevertheless, exactly these network dynamics are probably an important key to understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of certain diseases. A good example is cycling primary headaches like migraine and cluster headaches where the network dynamics between the hypothalamus and certain brainstem nuclei change during the cycling phases of the disease, i.e., from interictal to ictal phases, leading to altered nociceptive processing [ , , ]. However, further analysis of such dynamics is limited since causal insights into connectivity like Granger causality are not reliable for most fMRI experiments due to the poor temporal resolution [ , , ]. The most promising alternative, dynamical causal modelling (DCM) [ ], is a model with numerous limitations and constrains. The repetition time needs to be faster than 2 s and a strong a priori knowledge of all the regions of interest, their possible connectivity and how they are modulated must exist [ ]. These strong prerequisites are not met by many experiments. A promising tool with fewer prerequisites are psychophysiological interactions (PPI) [ ], yet it still depends on a minimum of two contrasting conditions. Both DCM and PPI work on the amplitude of the BOLD signal. Although the height of the amplitude is a strong indicator of the level of regional activity, a conventional connectivity analysis only using the absolute height as a marker may miss a functional connection since two regions can be highly connected but exhibit little stimulus-related activity since they can process more than just one input simultaneously. \n\nCorrelation analysis offers an alternative to inform about connectivity between spatially separated regions. One of the first approaches was to extract regional time courses and to calculate their correlation, as was done in the first resting-state studies [ ]. However, this approach has been shown to be susceptible to movement artifacts, cardiovascular changes, and high homogeneity within individual MR-slices [ , ], yielding spurious correlations. A question arising when using time-course correlation for task-dependent data is how many time points should be used when considering the correlation of time courses during a given task. Too many time points would mostly detect connectivity at baseline, while too few points may underestimate the actual connectivity. An additional question is how to handle dynamic stimuli, i.e., a stimulus that appears sometimes in the middle and sometimes at the end of a MR-volume (TR). \n\nOne way to overcome these limitations is to use single-trial activity patterns estimated by modeling each trial individually in a GLM [ , , ]. Such data are more robust to analyze since they are already corrected for motion, slice timing, and overlapping hemodynamics. This kind of analysis is also referred to as beta time series correlations [ , , , , ]. Trial-to-trial variability is, amongst others, based on changes of input strength (i.e., slight changes of stimulus), random fluctuations in attention and variations in endogenous (e.g., pre-stimulus) brain activity that modulates stimulus-evoked responses [ , ]. Such random fluctuations can inform communication between a seed area and all functionally connected cortical (and subcortical) areas; using a focused analysis allows to investigate network dynamics in fMRI datasets [ ]. This more abstract level of data correlation is framed as Ordinary Similarity or classical Representational Similarity Analysis [ , ] and has been shown to be reliable even for fast event-related designs and accordingly overlapping hemodynamics [ , , , , , ]. Nevertheless, even simple simulations show that ordinary correlation analysis can lead to false positive as well as false negative connectivity results (see  ). The connectivity between two hubs of a given network can be overestimated due to the existence of a strong global network signal. This means on a neuronal level, that the connectivity can be trivial when the whole network shows the same variation of activity. The same holds true when a third hub influences both hubs of interest. An example of underestimated connectivity would be that a third hub interferes with both hubs of interest, such that it modulates the first hub positively but the other negatively ( ). This case can also be seen as an example of two highly connected regions which process more than just one input and therefore show little stimulus-correlated activity as it represents only one part of the ongoing processing. To overcome this problem, partial correlation analysis could be used as complementary where the direct correlation between two hubs is controlled for other influences. This has been shown for the motor cortex by Marrelec and colleagues [ ] using raw time courses of fMRI data as input for their analysis and is in similar ways also used to analyze resting state data e.g., [ , ]. Considering the critique on correlations of time courses, we extended the Ordinary Similarity approach to Partial Similarity analysis where ordinary correlation is replaced by partial correlation to discover more specifically the direct communication between two individual regions. Using Partial Similarity analysis the communication between two hubs is corrected for a third hub, multiple other hubs, or even the rest of all network activity (including noise within the network) by subtracting their activity beforehand. Partial Similarity should be seen as being complementary to Ordinary Similarity; while Ordinary Similarity reveals a summary on the connectivity between two hubs which includes global as well as direct connectivity, Partial Similarity focuses only on the direct connectivity between them. \n\nWe tested our approach using simulations presented in the   and in brainstem-optimized fMRI data where 29 subjects underwent 15 trials of strong nociceptive trigeminal input into the left nostril as a painful condition and air puffs in the control condition. This leads to well-known activation of the trigeminal system [ , , ], with the spinal trigeminal nucleus being the first relay station of the central nervous system for incoming trigeminal input [ ]. Combining Representational Similarity with Partial Similarity, we were able to more reliably describe the trigeminal nociceptive network and additionally unravel direct connectivity between individual hubs of this network which may otherwise be hidden. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Simulations \n  \nTo prove the translation of using partial correlations for beta-time series analysis, we ran simulations to evaluate the complementary information revealed by Ordinary and Partial Similarity. In summary, we simulated several amounts of global network signals mixed into 100,000 voxel with 435 time points, i.e., betas. The simulations include: (i) no direct connectivity between a seed and a target voxel, (ii) several levels of direct connectivity between a seed and a target voxel, and (iii) a situation where the seed and the target voxel are influenced by one or more regions of a global network signal which has excitatory influence on the seed but inhibitory influence on the target voxel. We present these simulations in the   entitled \u201cSimulations on the effect of a global network signal on Ordinary and Partial Similarity\u201d. \n\n\n### 2.2. Subjects and Experimental Design \n  \nTwenty-nine healthy volunteers participated in our experiment on trigeminal nociception which has been repeatedly shown to prompt robust results (see Schulte et al. [ , , ]). The current data was partly already published [ , , ]. In short, participants received 15 trials of gaseous ammonia as nociceptive trigeminal input and 15 air puffs as a control condition. Each trial was rated for intensity and unpleasantness. The standardized experiment also included 15 trials of rose odor and 15 trials of visual stimulation not analyzed for this work. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee in Hamburg, Germany (PV 4522). The datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are not publicly available due to national data protection acts. Data are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. \n\n\n### 2.3. Image Acquisition \n  \nMR-Images were collected on a 3T scanner (TRIO, Siemens, Munich, Germany) using a 32-channel head coil. Functional images were acquired with high-resolution EPI optimized for the human brainstem (38 axial slices, 1.25 \u00d7 1.25 \u00d7 2.5 mm , TR 2.61 s, TE 27 ms, FOV 216 mm , GRAPPA accelerated, 2 saturation pulses) [ ]. The measured volume was restricted to the brainstem including the Thalamus and parts of the Cingulate Gyrus as the top border and the foramen magnum as the bottom border. The cerebellum was only partly within the measured volume. High-resolution structural images were obtained using an MPRAGE sequence with 1 mm  isotropic resolution [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.4. Preprocessing \n  \nFunctional and structural images were denoised using a spatially adaptive non-local means filter [ ] as implemented in the CAT12 toolbox ( ). Functional images were then realigned and slice time corrected using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London, UK). The average EPI was further co-registered to the participants\u2019 structural image. To realize our analytical approach, we calculated one General Linear Model (GLM) where each painful and each control trial was individually modeled with an HRF and included them as regressors of interest in a trial-by-trial GLM [ , ], while visual and odor condition were included as single, condition-wise regressors. Furthermore, we included models of button presses, the 6 movement regressors obtained in the realignment step within the preprocessing, and the discrete cosines (DCT), used in the standard SPM analyses as a high pass filter (128 Hz), in the GLM analysis. For physiological noise correction we additionally included 18 to 20 regressors extracted from the subjects\u2019 breathing and pulse signals with the approach described by Deckers and colleagues [ ]. Resulting trial-specific beta-images were then normalized to MNI space with an isotropic voxel size of 2 mm  using the segmentation of the participants\u2019 structural image as implemented in SPM12 and smoothed by a 2 mm  isotropic Gaussian kernel and are the basis of all further analyses. \n\nWe then compared the trial-by-trial GLM results [ ] to previously published results on condition-wise GLMs [ , , ], calculating a contrast image with all trials on the subject level which entered a group level one-tailed t-test with an uncorrected threshold of   p   < 0.0001. \n\nTrial-by-trial beta-images were further subject-wise subtracted by their mean and concatenated across subjects ( ). We used a mask for gray and white matter gained from segmenting the average of the spatially-adaptive non-local mean corrected and normalized structural images. Furthermore, all voxels with zero variance were rejected, leaving about 100,000 (precisely 96,973) voxels for the proposed analysis. \n\n\n### 2.5. Plausibility Checks \n  \nTo gain first insights into the meaning of the variance of trial-by-trial activity we ran a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the preprocessed, concatenated and standardized data. A PCA finds uncorrelated components of the data, which are sorted by their explained variance, and is used to reduce high dimensional data. The first component is therefore the most meaningful compartment of the data. Its weights explain which voxels contribute to which extent to the component and give important insights into the data quality and hint its meaning [ , , ]. \n\n\n### 2.6. Formulation of Similarity and Partial Similarity \n  \nAs a measure of connectivity between a seed area   x   and a target area   y  , we calculated Spearman correlation coefficients between their spatial means referred to as (representational) Similarity [ ]. Spearman correlation can be understood as a special case of classical Pearson\u2019s correlation using the rank   rg   of the sorted entries of   x   and   y   and can be formulated as\n \nwhere   COV   is the covariance matrix and   s   is the standard deviation. \n\nWe further introduce Partial Similarity, which is also based on the Spearman correlation but corrects for matrix   C   by subtracting a weighted, linear product of   C   before calculating the correlation coefficient, i.e., performs a partial correlation. This can be formulated by\n \nwhere   x   and   y   are again the spatially averaged beta-estimates of seed and target and   w   weights the vectors in   C  . In   C   we find the first components from the transform along the variance of the standardized beta-images of V (Volume of No Interest) by a PCA. This transformation is used for data reduction which becomes necessary because the number of concatenated beta-images limits the number of components, which can be used as controlling variables within the partial correlation, i.e., more controlling variables than the number of elements in   x   (and thereby   y  ) are not possible.   C   is formulated as\n \nwhere   V   are the standardized entries of all voxels with the Volume of No Interest (sketched in  ). The first component   C   of   V   is constructed by finding its weight   b   according to\n \nand the further components   C   iteratively by finding their weights   b   using an altered   in Formula 4 with the already calculated components subtracted from   V  . \n\nFinally, the weight   w   used in Formula 2 can then be estimated with simple linear regression for   x   and   y  , respectively, using\n \n\n\n### 2.7. Application of Similarity and Partial Similarity \n  \nIn the presented analyses we chose the left spinal trigeminal nucleus (STN) as a seed region as it is the first relay station in the central nervous system for trigeminal nociceptive input [ ]. As the center of the seed, we used MNI coordinates (\u22124, \u221246, \u221253) from a published independent sample [ ] and constructed a sphere around it with a radius of 8 mm. We further excluded the cerebellum from this sphere by masking it with the template provided by the SUIT toolbox for SPM 12 [ ] normalized to MNI space. \n\nThe target area is constructed as a sphere with a radius of 8 mm (like the seed) and wanders around the entire volume using a searchlight approach [ ] such that each voxel is the center of the target in exactly one iteration. The spatial average is used for calculating Similarity and Partial Similarity. \n\nTo perform Partial Similarity, the activity of the volume of no interest is first reduced along the variance into its first 15 components explaining a minimum of 30% of the variance (100 randomly chosen voxel were used for this estimation) by PCA as described above. Due to the high homogeneity between nearby areas, we defined an additional space with a radius of 15 mm around seed and target regions which were excluded from the analyses to prevent partial correlation coefficient of only \u22121 and 1. The proposed analyses are sketched in  . \n\n\n### 2.8. Statistics \n  \nThe   p  -values stemming from the calculated Spearman correlations and partial correlations are corrected for multiple comparison using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg [ ] and the Benjamini\u2014Yekutieli [ , ] procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) of a family of hypothesis tests [ ]. All reported statistical tests are one-tailed. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Simulations \n  \nThe first simulation shows that a global network signal induces a strong connectivity between seed and target as measured by Ordinary Similarity analysis which can reach correlation values close to 1 when the influence of the global network signal is extreme ( ). The Partial Similarity analysis shows, as expected, that there is no direct connectivity between seed and target ( ). As the maximally measured correlation coefficients in the actual data reaches levels of around r = 0.2 and the explained variance of the controlling variables is around 30%, the global network signal might have an influence of up to 60% in our real fMRI beta time series data. \n\nThe second Simulation shows the complementary information of Ordinary and Partial Similarity: While the Ordinary Similarity reveals connectivity induced either by the global network signal or direct connectivity or a mixture of both, Partial Similarity only reveals the direct connectivity component. \n\nSimulation 3 tests to mislead Ordinary Similarity by adding a global network signal to the seed but subtracting it from the target. Here, Ordinary Similarity can reveal even negative correlations or near-zero correlations when the magnitude of the global signal and the direct connectivity is similar. Details of the simulations can be found in the  . \n\n\n### 3.2. Plausibility \n  \nTrial-by-trial GLM analysis confirmed previously published results [ , , , , , , , ], i.e., significant activation in left STN, rostral Pons, Cerebellum, periaqueductal gray (PAG), Thalamus, and bilateral Insula ( A). Due to the restricted measured volume, no activation could be shown in other areas. The first component of the PCA on the concatenated trial-by-trial beta-images from the GLM explains 9.85% of the overall variance (voxel \u00d7 trials) and reveals a plausible network within the brainstem during trigeminal nociception. The network includes previous reported hubs of trigeminal nociception in the brainstem and midbrain such as the STN, rostral Pons, Cerebellum, PAG, bilateral Thalamus and bilateral Insula ( B). This unsupervised analysis underlines the potential of analyzing trial-by-trial variance. \n\n\n### 3.3. Similarity and Partial Similarity \n  \nSimilarity analysis from the STN ROI as a seed reveals three clusters with positive correlations and 16 clusters with negative correlations at a statistical threshold of FDR-adjusted   p   < 0.05, where the most extensive cluster contains more than 54% of all considered voxel, especially most of the midbrain. To pinpoint more specific regions, we increased the statistical threshold to an FDR-adjusted   p  -value of   p   < 0.0001, revealing nine clusters with similar trial-to-trial activity changes as the STN in the nociceptive condition ( A) with a minimum cluster extent of 5 voxel (40 mL). The clusters mostly include cortical and subcortical structures already shown to be involved in trigeminal nociception like bilateral Cerebellum, bilateral PAG, bilateral Insula, bilateral Operculum, right Striatum (Caudate, Putamen), and bilateral Thalamus and furthermore the right Cingulate Gyrus ( ). \n\nThe control condition with air puffs also showed highly correlated midbrain areas at a threshold of FDR-adjusted   p   < 0.05. Regarding nociception, we therefore increased the threshold to   p   < 0.0001 ( B,  ) and identified seven clusters correlated with the left STN seed region in their trial-to-trial variance. These clusters included the bilateral Cerebellum, bilateral PAG, the left inferior Temporal Gyrus, left Fusiform Gyrus, and the right Planum Polare ( ). \n\nPartial Similarity analysis of the nociceptive condition revealed 10 clusters with positive correlation and 3 negative correlation to STN ( A) at an FDR-adjusted threshold of   p   < 0.05 and a minimum cluster extent of 20 voxel (160 mL). The included regions are bilateral Cerebellum, PAG, and Cingulate Gyrus, parts of the temporal lobe (right Planum Temporale, right Middle Temporal Gyrus, left Inferior Temporal Gyrus), bilateral Striatum (Caudate), and with a negative correlation the right Fusiform Gyrus and both sides of the Thalamus ( ,  ). Most of the regions are well known to process painful trigeminal input. \n\nIn the control condition, we observed four clusters with positive correlations and one cluster with negative correlations to the STN ( B,  ), namely bilateral Cerebellum and the Temporal Pole ( ). \n\nTo gain an overview of the reported results, we sketched the revealed connectivities and their strength from the Similarity and Partial Similarity analyses in  . While both connectivity analyses show strong connectivities to Cerebellum and PAG during nociception and reveal the direct connectivity from STN to (contralateral) Thalamus, the strong contralateral crossing to higher cortical areas (Temporal lobe, Insula, Fusiform Gyrus) is only revealed using Partial Similarity analysis. In the control condition, the Similarity analyses suggest a network between left STN and bilateral Cerebellum and bilateral PAG. The latter could not be identified in the Partial Similarity analysis. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nUncovering cortical and subcortical connectivity in human fMRI data is a challenging field as to date only a few methods exist. While commonly used DCM and PPI both work on raw time courses, they depend on the height of BOLD amplitude, and are further hindered by a long list of assumptions and constraints, ordinary correlation analysis may lead mostly to an overestimation of results. Here we introduce a new way to delineate direct (dynamic) network connectivity complementary to ordinary correlation analyses of beta time series: Partial Similarity. \n\nWe conceptually proved that Partial Similarity and its counterpart, (based on ordinary correlations) Ordinary Similarity, reliably reveal dynamic connectivity of brainstem networks known from preclinical studies. As a physiological model, we specifically chose the connectivity of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, which is the first central hub of all incoming peripheral trigemino-nociceptive input into the central nervous system (CNS). Studies on mammals suggest direct anatomical connections to the cerebellum [ , , ], Thalamus [ ], and PAG [ , , ], which are known to be involved in mechanical and nociceptive input [ , , , ]. Additional to these well-known hubs, Similarity further reveals strong connectivity to the ipsilateral Insula and Operculum, which was not observed with Partial Similarity. Partial Similarity on the other hand emphasizes connectivity to contralateral regions like the striatum, Fusiform Gyrus, Temporal lobe, and ipsilateral Cingulate Gyrus. These differences stem from the nature of the two measures, which we demonstrated in our simulations: while Similarity shows overall communication between two regions, Partial Similarity focuses on direct communication between two hubs, diminishing trivial and induced correlations, but uncovering correlations hidden by other sources or a global network signal. Both analyzing techniques contain complementary information (direct communication and overall communication), which should be exploited in future research by locating the origin of these differences. We suggest that imaging studies, which investigate relationships in and between neuronal networks, will strongly profit from the combination of both analytical tools. This is particularly true for research investigating cycling pathologies like migraine and cluster headaches [ ], where changes in network dynamics [ ] follow the current stage of the patients\u2019 disease [ , , ]. While we concentrate on the first hub of the trigeminal driven network in the CNS, further research will reveal the dynamical connectivity of all hubs in the network and may identify cortical and subcortical structures by combining both analytical tools, which would be missed if only one of these tools were used. Moreover, given the open-ended search feature of the proposed analyses, we aim to identify connectivity and its dynamics and hubs, which is not yet within the focus of current research. Further work will have to include the translation of Partial Similarity to other fields of Representational Similarity applications [ ], where trivial correlations currently might hinder a deeper insight into direct relations, for example in the field of complementing fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG) [ ]. Partial Similarity and Similarity analyses as established in the current work might thus be an important tool to discover neuronal network dynamics in fMRI and thus grant more detailed insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurological diseases, including but not limited to primary headache disorders. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nWe have shown with both simulated and real task-dependent fMRI data that the Partial Similarity method presented here can represent direct connectivity between two hubs. Specifically, Partial Similarity can unravel brainstem dynamics involved in trigeminal pain. It thereby gains complementary information to Ordinary (also called Representational) Similarity, which reveals a summary of global and direct connectivity. The combination of both methods can be valuable tools in discovering network dynamics in fMRI and an important instrument for future insight into the nature of pathological pain processing and various other neurological diseases. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: brainsci-10-00603-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nRegion\tx\ty\tz\tCluster Size (vx)\tCorrelation (Peak)\tMean Correlation\tp-Value (Peak)\tFDR-Adjusted p-Value (Peak)\nNociception\tNociception\tNociception\tNociception\tNociception\tNociception\tNociception\tNociception\tNociception\nr Cingulate G\t4\t\u221244\t23\t123\t0.29\t0.23\t6 \u00d7 10\u221210\t2 \u00d7 10\u22128\nr Insula, Operculum\t32\t\u221216\t15\t872\t0.29\t0.23\t2 \u00d7 10\u221210\t1 \u00d7 10\u22128\nl Insula, Operculum\t\u221250\t\u221234\t13\t1512\t0.29\t0.23\t3 \u00d7 10\u221210\t1 \u00d7 10\u22128\nb Thalamus\t\u22122\t0\t7\t435\t0.26\t0.21\t2 \u00d7 10\u22128\t5 \u00d7 10\u22127\nr Caudate, Putamen\t18\t16\t3\t329\t0.26\t0.22\t2 \u00d7 10\u22128\t5 \u00d7 10\u22127\nr Operculum\t48\t14\t1\t71\t0.22\t0.21\t1 \u00d7 10\u22126\t2 \u00d7 10\u22125\nr Insula\t42\t0\t\u22125\t116\t0.26\t0.22\t2 \u00d7 10\u22128\t5 \u00d7 10\u22127\nl Insula, Operculum\t\u221226\t26\t\u221211\t622\t0.27\t0.22\t6 \u00d7 10\u22129\t2 \u00d7 10\u22127\nb Cerebellum, PAG\t\u221220\t\u221256\t\u221249\t9358\t0.38\t0.25\t8 \u00d7 10\u221219\t1 \u00d7 10\u221216\nControl condition\tControl condition\tControl condition\tControl condition\tControl condition\tControl condition\tControl condition\tControl condition\tControl condition\nb Cerebellum\t\u221258\t\u221216\t7\t378\t0.25\t0.23\t6 \u00d7 10\u22128\t6 \u00d7 10\u22126\nr Planum Polare\t60\t\u22122\t5\t35\t0.24\t0.22\t3 \u00d7 10\u22127\t2 \u00d7 10\u22125\nl Inferior Temporal G\t\u221248\t\u221258\t\u221211\t72\t0.25\t0.23\t5 \u00d7 10\u22128\t5 \u00d7 10\u22126\nl Fusiform G\t\u221236\t\u221236\t\u221217\t44\t0.25\t0.23\t4 \u00d7 10\u22128\t4 \u00d7 10\u22126\nb Cerebellum, PAG\t\u221214\t\u221234\t\u221221\t1092\t0.32\t0.24\t6 \u00d7 10\u221212\t3 \u00d7 10\u22129\nb Cerebellum\t16\t\u221244\t\u221249\t1518\t0.38\t0.26\t5 \u00d7 10\u221218\t8 \u00d7 10\u221215\nl Cerebellum\t\u221238\t\u221252\t\u221253\t6\t0.22\t0.22\t2 \u00d7 10\u22126\t7 \u00d7 10\u22125\n### Caption\nResults for the Similarity analysis during trigeminal nociception (gaseous ammonia) and control condition (air puffs) at a statistical threshold of FDR-adjusted p < 0.0001 and a minimum cluster extent of 5 voxel (40 mL).

The experience is one of rocking dizziness similar to when the individual was originally on the motion trigger such as a boat or airplane. MdDS represents a prolonged version of a normal phenomenon familiar to most individuals but which persists for months or years in others. It represents a natural example of the neuroplasticity of motion adaptation. However, the localization of where that motion adaptation occurs is unknown. Our goal was to localize metabolic and functional connectivity changes associated with persistent MdDS. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nTwenty subjects with MdDS lasting a median duration of 17.5 months were compared to 20 normal controls with  F FDG PET and resting state fMRI. Resting state metabolism and functional connectivity were calculated using age, grey matter volume, and mood and anxiety scores as nuisance covariates. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nMdDS subjects showed increased metabolism in the left entorhinal cortex and amygdala (z>3.3). Areas of relative hypometabolism included the left superior medial gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, right amygdala, right insula, and clusters in the left superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri. MdDS subjects showed increased connectivity between the entorhinal cortex/amygdala cluster and posterior visual and vestibular processing areas including middle temporal gyrus, motion sensitive area MT/V5, superior parietal lobule, and primary visual cortex, while showing decreased connectivity to multiple prefrontal areas. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThese data show an association between resting state metabolic activity and functional connectivity between the entorhinal cortex and amygdala in a human disorder of abnormal motion perception. We propose a model for how these biological substrates can allow a limited period of motion exposure to lead to chronic perceptions of self-motion. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIn an 1881 article in the Lancet, J.A. Irwin wrote about a common phenomenon that occurs after sea travel: \u201cThis leads to the question of how all the phenomena of seasickness have usually a rapid tendency to pass away \u2026 the new habit may become so strong that a disturbance of it, by a return to the land, will be marked by similar phenomena; hence the unsteady gait sometimes observable\u2026after a long and stormy voyage  .\u201d The unsteadiness that occurs after one disembarks from a boat or plane is a common phenomenon that normally ceases within two days of returning to land  ,  . However, in some individuals, a sensation that they are still rocking on the boat persists for months or years leading to imbalance, visuospatial problems, and cognitive dysfunction  . When this phenomenon becomes persistent, it is formally known as   mal de debarquement syndrome  , literally meaning \u201cthe sickness of disembarkment\u201d (MdDS)  . \n\nVery little is known about the underlying neurobiology that leads to persistent MdDS as there are no scientific studies that have established the underlying anatomical cause of this perceptual disorder. \n\nCase series have shown that there are no inner ear or structural brain abnormalities associated with MdDS, which is not unexpected since the triggers that lead to persistent MdDS such as going on a cruise, flying in an airplane, or driving for long distances are unlikely to cause structural brain or inner ear damage  . However, MdDS may be a disorder of neuroplasticity in which entrainment to a periodically moving environment changes the functional state of the brain making it difficult to readapt to stable land conditions. Individuals with MdDS feel much better when back in motion again, such as getting back on the boat or driving in a car  ,  . The inability to shut off the mechanisms that become activated during motion exposure that prevent motion sickness (getting one's \u201csea-legs\u201d) may be related to aging and hormonal factors, as MdDS is typically a disorder of middle-aged individuals and is more common in women  . \n\nThe localization for this persistent motion illusion has not been previously sought with functional neuroimaging though previous theories have included \u201cvestibular flashbacks,\u201d and \u201cinternal modeling\u201d of the external motion suggesting a central localization  ,  . The localization of a key hub of motion adaptation, one that can remain persistently active after the stimulus is removed, would represent a remarkable form of neuroplasticity that is relevant to brain adaptability in aging and that also plays a role in motion intolerance. \n\nWe hypothesized that the persistent motion illusion of MdDS would be reflected by changes in brain metabolism and functional connectivity involving areas that process and store spatial information. MdDS represents a natural experimental model of the neuroplasticity of the motion adaption system and though it is an uncommon cause of imbalance, it may inform a deeper understanding of how motion information is stored in the brain. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Ethics Statement \n  \nStudy procedures were completed according to Declaration of Helsinki guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California Los Angeles. The study was specifically approved by Medical IRB 3 which oversees neuroscience research. Subjects provided written informed consent. \n\nPatients with a history of persistent MdDS meeting the following criteria were recruited through a University Neurology clinic: 1) A chronic perception of rocking dizziness that started after passive motion exposure such as from sea, air, or land travel; 2) Symptoms lasted at least one month; 3) Normal inner ear function testing with video or electronystagmography and audiograms; 4) Normal structural brain imaging with a non-contrast brain MRI; 5) First lifetime episode of MdDS; 6) No other cause for symptoms after evaluation by a neurologist. \n\nControls who did not have a history of dizziness or balance problems were recruited through advertisements and were screened for dizziness and neurological disorders. All subjects completed the Edinburgh handedness inventory   and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)  . \n\n\n### PET images \n  \nSubjects fasted for >2 hours prior to undergoing the PET scan. No subject had a finger stick glucose of >140 mg/dL. After injection of 5 mCi (185 MBq) of  F-FDG into an antecubital vein, subjects sat with their eyes closed in a quiet dark room for the 40-minute uptake period. They were then scanned in 3D acquisition mode with a 30-minute emission scan followed by a 20-minute transmissions scan on a Siemens ECAT EXACT HR+ Scanner. Sixty-three slices were obtained with an axial resolution of 2.4 mm. Images were corrected for scatter, decay, scanner dead time, and attenuation and were reconstructed by back-projection using an all pass ramp filter of 2 mm full width half-maximum (FWHM). Attenuation correction was performed using a  Germanium source. The preprocessed images obtained had a resolution of 128\u00d7128 voxels with a zoom of 2.75 mm. \n\n\n### MRI images \n  \nStructural scans. Subjects were scanned on a Siemens Magnetom Trio 3Tesla scanner with a 12-channel head coil. Specifications for structural images were as follows: 192 slices at 1 mm slice thickness, voxel size: 1.0 mm\u00d71.0 mm\u00d71.0 mm, FoV: 256 mm, flip angle: 9 degrees, TR\u200a=\u200a1900 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a3.25 ms. \n\n#### Resting state scans \n  \nThe fMRI scanning parameters for resting state BOLD data acquisition were as follows: Whole-brain gradient-echo planar imaging sequences of 36 slices at 3 mm thickness, voxel size: 3.4 mm\u00d73.4 mm\u00d73.0 mm, FoV: 220 mm, TR\u200a=\u200a2000 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a30 ms, 120 volumes. \n\n\n#### Frontal eye field (FEF) and motion sensitive area (V5/MT) localization \n  \nThe fMRI scanning parameters for task based BOLD data acquisition were as follows: Whole-brain gradient-echo planar imaging sequences of 36 slices at 3 mm thickness, voxel size: 3.4 mm\u00d73.4 mm\u00d73.0 mm, FoV: 220 mm, TR\u200a=\u200a3000 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a30 ms; 96 volumes for the saccade task and 140 volumes for V5/MT localization. \n\nTo localize motion sensitive area V5/MT, subjects were shown a random dot kinematogram in which 21 seconds of random dot motion were alternated with 21 seconds of coherent motion moving in either the NW-SE or NE-SW direction. Subjects maintained fixation on a center fixation dot during stimulation and were shown 10 blocks of coherent motion alternating with 10 blocks of random motion. \n\nFor the saccade task, subjects were asked to look to each side of a black screen while a small white box flashed alternately from the right and left sides. Each stimulus was given for one second at a position 10 degrees from the center fixation point. Nine saccades to each side (18 seconds total) were followed by an 18 second resting block. Subjects were shown eight pairs of the saccade/rest blocks. \n\nEye tracking was performed with Restech \u00ae video goggles using Arrington ViewPoint Eye Tracking\u00ae software to ensure that the subjects performed the appropriate tasks. \n\n\n\n### PET image analysis \n  \nAll image analyses for PET data were performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) 8 ( ) with Matlab 2009b (Mathworks, Natick, MA.). The high-resolution structural images were realigned to the mean image, co-registered to the PET image and then normalized to the standard T1 template in spm8 in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Images were smoothed with a 8 mm Gaussian kernel at FWHM. Grand-mean scaling, implicit masking and proportional normalization were performed. Voxels with a normalized intensity <0.8 were excluded in order to remove signal from cerebrospinal fluid and skull. A two-sample   t   test was performed between the smoothed normalized summed PET images of the MdDS vs. Control (CTRL) groups in whole brain analysis at z>3.3. Subjects' scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and age were used to regress out signal that co-varied with age and high depression and anxiety scores. \n\n\n### MRI image analysis \n  \n#### Voxel based morphometry (VBM) \n  \nStructural images were reoriented using SPM5 to align the images in the anterior and posterior planes. Using the Matlab based VBM5 toolbox, each image was segmented into grey matter, white matter and CSF volumes in each subject's native brain space. Modulated images were created using medium hidden Markov random field weighting. After normalization, the images were smoothed with a 8 mm Gaussian kernel at FWHM and a sample homogeneity test was performed to remove any outliers. The Marsbar ( ) toolbox was used to extract GM values from ROIs defined by PET. \n\n\n#### FEF, V5/MT, and V1 localization \n  \nContrast images for \u201ccoherent motion-minus-random motion\u201d at a whole brain corrected threshold of   z  >3.3 were created for each individual subject and the individual contrast images were averaged for the MdDS group and for the CTRL group separately. Similarly, the contrast images for \u201csaccade-minus-fixation\u201d were created for each individual and averaged for MdDS subjects and CTRL groups at a whole brain corrected threshold of   z  >3.3. Multiple regression analysis on all visual stimulation data was performed to show brain areas that had the highest correlation with visual stimulation, to define right and left areas V1. \n\n\n#### Functional connectivity \n  \nImage analysis was performed using Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF), a MATLAB based toolbox  . The first 10 images were removed to account for equilibration, were realigned to the center image, and normalized to a standard T1 template. After spatial smoothing, global trends were removed and a map of the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was created. Meantime series within specified ROIs were extracted from the ALFF maps. \n\nPearson's correlation coefficients were determined between ALFF maps at each of the peak voxels in each ROI and were converted by Fisher's r-to-z transformation into z scores (NOTE: the z scores on PET analysis are statistical z's, a measure of standard deviations from the mean. z scores for functional connectivity are Fisher's z's, a measure of correlation). Brain areas that have high correlations in spontaneous activity are functionally connected. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Clinical History \n  \nTwenty subjects with MdDS (mean age: 43.4 years, SEM: 2.50, Range: 27\u201366 years) participated in the study. The MdDS subjects included 15 women and 5 men, with a median duration of symptoms lasting 17.5 months (range 3\u2013240 months). Eleven subjects developed symptoms after sea travel (typically a cruise); eight after air travel, and one after a train ride. All but one subject was still symptomatic during a follow-up period of 12\u201336 months after they were imaged. These MdDS subjects were compared to 20 controls matched for age, sex, and handedness (mean age: 43.0 years, SEM: 2.91, Range 23\u201359 years). There were two-left-handed subjects in each group. Two sample independent Wilcoxon rank sum test for age was 414 for the MdDS group and 406 for CTRL, with   p  \u200a=\u200a0.914. All subjects had normal neurological exams. \n\n\n### PET analysis \n  \nOne cluster in the MdDS>CTRL contrast at MNI coordinate x\u200a=\u200a\u221214; y\u200a=\u200a\u22128, z\u200a=\u200a\u221222 exceeded threshold at z>3.3 ( ). The probability atlas of J\u00fclich in the Anatomy toolbox maps the peak voxel to between the left entorhinal cortex and the superficial group (SF) of the amygdala   ( ). Cortical areas in the CTRL>MdDS contrast significant at z>3.3 included the left superior medial gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus left superior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, right amygdala and right insula (these two were part of one large cluster) (  ,   ). \n   Area of relative hypermetabolism in MdDS subjects compared to controls.  \nCluster with peak voxel z>3.3 for the MdDS>CTRL contrast (MNI coordinates \u221214 \u22128 \u221222) centered at the entorhinal cortex/amygdala transition shown in the a) sagittal; b) coronal; c) axial planes. Image is presented at   z  >2.57 for better visualization; extent voxels: 0. \n     Areas of relative hypometabolism in MdDS subjects compared to controls.  \nClusters with peak voxel z>3.3 for the CTRL>MdDS contrast: a) Left superior medial gyrus; b) Left middle temporal gyrus; c) Left superior temporal gyrus; d) Left inferior temporal gyrus; e) Left middle frontal gyrus; f/g) Right amygdala and insula. Images are shown at   z  >1.96 for better visualization; extent voxels: 0. \n     Peak voxels of significance in MdDS>CTRL and CTRL>MdDS contrasts showing unadjusted and adjusted z scores for grey matter volume.      \n#### Correcting for grey matter probability \n  \nAfter correction for grey matter volume, all clusters remained significant at z>1.96, and all but the left middle frontal gyrus cluster remained significant at z> 3.3 ( ). \n\n\n#### Ruling out correlation with depression and anxiety scores \n  \nThe mean HADS anxiety subscore in the MdDS group was 8.8+/\u22124.7 versus 3.4+/\u22123.6 in controls (  p  <0.001). The mean depression subscore in the MdDS group was 6.5+/\u22125.2 versus 1.6+/\u22122.1 in controls (  p  <0.001). On the HADS rating scale, 0\u20137\u200a=\u200anormal, 8\u201310\u200a=\u200aborderline, and 11\u201321\u200a=\u200aabnormal indicating borderline anxiety and high normal depression scores in the MdDS subjects. Although the primary analysis had used age and the HADS scores as nuisance covariates we also performed multiple regression analysis to show voxels that have the highest correlation with high anxiety or high depression scores using scores from all 40 subjects (20 MdDS+20 CTRL). Because depression and anxiety are often comorbid conditions, depression specific areas were obtained by the Depression>Anxiety contrast, and anxiety specific areas were obtained by the Anxiety>Depression contrast. \n\nThe resulting voxels did not show any overlap with any of the regions seen in the primary analysis, even at a more liberal threshold of   z  >1.96. This analysis did reveal other areas previously known to be highly relevant in mood disorders. The top 5 clusters that correlated with high depression and high anxiety scores are presented in     and    and   . Of particular significance was the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex activity correlating with high depression scores and the dorsal midbrain and anterior temporal lobe activity correlating with high anxiety scores. \n\n\n#### Functional connectivity \n  \nBecause the entorhinal cortex has extensive connections with much of the neocortex, we determined whether there might be a relationship between the entorhinal cortex/amygdala (EC/AG) hypermetabolism and areas of relative hypometabolism. In addition, functional connectivity was calculated between the EC/AG focus and the ipsilateral FEF, V5/MT, superior parietal lobule (SPL), and V1 in order to determine whether there is an underlying difference in the pattern of connectivity between the EC/AG and anterior versus posterior neocortex. The superior parietal lobule, a key area of spatial information processing was anatomically defined in the J\u00fclich atlas. All others were functionally defined. \n\n shows decreased functional connectivity between the EC/AG and prefrontal, premotor, superior temporal, and inferior temporal foci in MdDS subjects compared to CTRLs, whereas connectivity is increased between EC/AG and middle temporal, SPL, V5/MT, and V1, all areas that process either visual or vestibular information. Connectivity to contralateral insula was also reduced to a lesser degree and connectivity to the contralateral amygdala was comparable to CTRLs. \n   Functional connectivity differences in subjects with MdDS compared to controls.  \na) Functional connectivity between the left EC/AG hypermetabolic focus in MdDS and regions of relative hypometabolism, shown in the context of landmark areas FEF, SPL, V5/MT, and V1. b) Functional connectivity between homologous brain regions. c) Foci are presented anterior to posterior anatomically.

Functional connectivity between homologous brain regions extending from the FEFs all the way to SPL was reduced in MdDS subjects whereas it was exactly the same between bilateral areas V5/MT and V1 compared to CTRLs. Connectivity between EC/AG and the ipsilateral middle temporal gyrus and SPL were increased despite overall reduced connectivity between hemispheres at these levels. Thus, functional connectivity between these posterior temporal and occipital areas and area EC/AG was increased relative to the general pattern of connectivity differences seen between MdDS and CTRL subjects. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe neural substrates for persistent MdDS have never been previously investigated with functional neuroimaging and this study presents an anatomical basis for what has been previously considered to be a completely subjective syndrome of chronic rocking dizziness. We show that MdDS, a disorder of continuous self-motion perception is associated with hypermetabolism of the left EC/AG, decreased prefrontal and temporal lobe metabolism, increased functional connectivity with posterior spatial processing areas, and decreased connectivity with several prefrontal areas. Functional connectivity was reduced between all homologous regions in frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes in MdDS subjects while being preserved for posterior temporal (V5/MT) and primary visual cortex (V1). \n\nThese data implicate the entorhinal cortex and amygdala in a human disorder of persistent motion perception and expand the role that EC/AG plays in human spatial memory. This is the first study to show metabolic abnormalities in patients with a chronic illusion of motion and provides information that may expand the relevance of limbic function to motion perception. \n\nThe entorhinal cortex is situated in the mesial temporal lobe anterior to the hippocampus. The medial entorhinal cortex receives highly processed spatial information from a broad swath of the neocortex, primarily from somatosensory association cortex and perirhinal cortex but with important connectivity to the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. It is the main gateway of neocortical information entering the hippocampus  \u2013 . \u2018Grid cells\u2019 located in the medial entorhinal cortex whose activity is highly correlated with spatial location, speed, and direction of heading are specialized cells that exhibit high directional selectivity and are primed to encode information about the current context of movement  . Grid cell maps are not rigid but are quickly modified by environmental context  ,  . \n\nExperiments done in humans playing virtual reality video games while undergoing fMRI scanning have revealed entorhinal cortex activity modulated by perceived speed and direction of movement  . Activity in the left hippocampal formation specifically activates when egocentric information is preferred for spatial navigation, whereas the right hippocampal formation favors an allocentric strategy  . Thus, the finding of the left entorhinal cortex activity in MdDS, a disorder of chronic self-motion perception, may relate to a network that is specialized for processing spatial information using an egocentric spatial reference and which normally functions to encode direction and speed specific information. \n\nA distinguishing feature of MdDS is the reduction in the rocking perception with re-exposure to passive motion, a unique and unexplained feature among balance disorders  . In essence, the external motion appears to null the motion perception. A theory for this has only been proposed as an adaptation to the prior motion stimulus. A more specific theory proposed here relates to a key function of the entorhinal cortex as a major hub of generating network oscillations, specifically theta oscillations that drive the creation of place fields within the hippocampus, the key to spatial navigation  \u2013 . Direct stimulation of the human entorhinal cortex during epilepsy surgery improves spatial navigation skills with positive learning trials being associated with a resetting of the phase of the theta rhythm in the hippocampus  . One theory for the nulling effect of re-exposure to passive motion in MdDS (such as returning to sea or driving a car) is that the frequency and amplitude of the incoming vestibular and somatosensory signals override or phase cancel out an underlying oscillating rhythm. \n\nOf relevance to MdDS is that the entorhinal cortex is one of two brain areas that can generate sustained activity in the absence of continuous input; the other being the prefrontal cortex to which it is highly connected  \u2013 . Single pulse stimulation of entorhinal cortex can generate a recurrent loop of activity within the entorhinal cortex itself, which then spreads into the hippocampus when past threshold  . Periodic stimulation can also drive baseline entorhinal cortex faster or slower, depending on the period of the stimulation. One elegant study on   in vitro   brain slices showed that depolarizing electrical stimulation to the entorhinal cortex given in four second pulses raises its baseline firing rate, whereas hyperpolarizing pulses given in six second pulses gradually reduces the baseline firing rate to the point of stopping the activity  . Thus, baseline entorhinal cortex activity can potentially be modified by a change in the periodicity of its neuronal inputs making it is a plausible substrate for entrainment by external stimuli. \n\nThe amygdala activity seen in these data is consistent with the dependence of the entorhinal cortex on amygdala activity for efficient information transfer into the hippocampus  . Transfer of sensory information into the entorhinal cortex largely comes through the perirhinal cortex but studies in rat brain slices have shown that individual stimulation of perirhinal cortex is inefficient in spreading activity into the entorhinal cortex. However, concurrent stimulation of the amygdala promotes spread of activity from perirhinal cortex to the entorhinal cortex and subsequently into the hippocampus, a phenomenon that may be the basis for the role of motivational and emotional variables in memory consolidation  \n\nThe role of the prefrontal cortex in the generation of MdDS may be due to its strong functional and anatomical connections to both the entorhinal cortex and amygdala, specifically being shown in animal models to be inhibited by the entorhinal cortex while exerting regulatory control over both these areas  ,  . The reduced prefrontal connectivity seen in these data, particularly in the setting of increased connectivity with motion processing areas in posterior parietal, temporal, and occipital areas may together contribute to the increased activity with the entorhinal cortex and amygdala and contribute to a poorly regulated network where there is enhanced transmission of motion information into limbic areas with less regulatory control. Only connectivity between the EC/AG and other brain regions were investigated in this study. It is possible, however that connectivity between these areas (e.g. prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex) is also important in the generation of MdDS symptoms. \n\nOne phenomenon in MdDS that suggests a very strong role for structures involved in memory consolidation is that many patients experience a spontaneous re-emergence of their rocking dizziness even years after their original MdDS subsides  . The role of the amygdala may be relevant to why some patients who have an initial episode of MdDS that resolves tend to have spontaneous recurrences of the rocking sensation during periods of stress  . In addition, when patients experience recurrent episodes of MdDS, the episodes tend to become longer  . This suggests that functional connections that are created during the original period of habituation to background sea or air conditions can be strengthened with time and may develop a lower threshold for activation with subsequent stimulation. \n\nBecause of the inherent confound of concurrent mood and anxiety disorders which complicate chronic illness, we found it necessary to take extra steps to be sure that differentially active brain areas in MdDS were not simply due to anxiety or depression. The HADS is a well-validated screening tool of seven items of anxiety and seven items of depression  . We used scores on the HADS anxiety and depression subcomponents as nuisance covariates to remove signal that varied with high HADS subscores. However, in order to determine whether the peak voxels in the contrast images may have occurred even   near   regions implicated in anxiety and depression and may have been considered distinct simply because of thresholding, we used a multivariate regression analysis to identify brain areas that were specifically associated with high anxiety and depression scores. Using this analysis, classical brain areas that have been previously reported to be under/overactive in anxiety and depression were revealed but did not overlap with any areas seen in the primary analysis. These included the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex activity that correlated with depression  \u2013  and dorsal midbrain and anterior temporal lobe activity correlating with anxiety  \u2013 . There are no resting state FDG PET studies in anxiety disorders that have shown abnormalities in baseline metabolic activity in the entorhinal cortex or amygdala but amygdala activity is inducible in many anxiety subtypes when measured with fMRI  ,  . Baseline glucose metabolism has been found to be higher in the left amygdala in depressed patients when analysis is limited to a region of interest over the amygdala  . Although it is possible that the amygdala activity in our data is related to baseline depression in MdDS subjects, the entorhinal cortex activity is not explained by previous imaging findings in mood and anxiety disorders. \n\nBecause it was still possible that the findings of enhanced entorhinal cortex and amygdala activity were related to higher baseline mood symptoms that were not fully measured with the HADS questionnaire, we also undertook a functional connectivity analysis to determine whether there were different patterns in connectivity that could relate to motion processing pathways. These connectivity differences appeared to be specific to the posterior parietal and occipital areas that process visuospatial information, with connectivity being enhanced in subjects with MdDS despite overall connectivity patterns being reduced between frontal and temporal areas. \n\nThe data presented here expand the relevance of the metabolic activity and connectivity of limbic structures to a human disorder of continuous perception of self-motion. Despite MdDS being considered a rare disorder, the study of a condition where the initial adaptation to background oscillating conditions do not successfully readapt back to stable conditions would still reflect a pathway relevant to motion adaptation. These pathways would be easier to measure in MdDS patients because the symptoms are stable and persistent, unlike the transient feelings of rocking felt by most individuals after travel that can dissipate within minutes. Although the controls were matched as well as possible given age, sex, and handedness, a more ideal control group would have been one that was also matched for the motion exposure. From a practical standpoint, this was not possible since there are infinite combinations of sea, air, and land conditions that may have been relevant to why the MdDS subjects had developed their symptoms. \n\nThe question that cannot be directly answered from this study is whether the entorhinal cortex or amygdala activity is the actual   source   of the motion related activity or is only relevant to the pathways that mediate   perception  . This can only be answered with a tool with better temporal resolution where the perception of rocking can be turned on-and-off. Enhanced activity in these limbic areas, which are important drivers of brain oscillations, may be affecting downstream areas that are responsible for the actual motion perception. Areas that project to or from the entorhinal cortex and amygdala may thus be possible targets for future studies that attempt to delineate the boundary between the source of the motion relevant activity versus areas that simply allow that activity to reach consciousness. Perhaps more relevant to patients with MdDS who remain without a cure for their symptoms, is that these connectivity changes may be used as the basis for developing neuromodulation strategies that aim to treat this persistent motion disorder. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0049560-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nContrast\tX\tY\tZ\tke\tzunadj\tzadjVBM\tLocalization\nMdDS>CTRL\t\u221214\t\u22128\t\u221222\t12\t3.66\t3.61\tLeft entorhinal cortex/amygdala\nCTRL>MdDS\t\u22128\t52\t36\t39\t4.03\t4.01\tLeft superior medial gyrus\n\t\u221250\t\u221252\t8\t40\t3.86\t3.25\tLeft middle temporal gyrus\n\t\u221252\t0\t\u221214\t41\t3.67\t3.84\tLeft superior temporal gyrus\n\t\u221252\t\u221238\t\u221224\t42\t3.56\t3.63\tLeft inferior temporal gyrus\n\t\u221232\t18\t30\t38\t3.53\t2.05\tLeft middle frontal gyrus\n\t30\t\u22122\t\u221226\t13\t3.45\t3.39\tRight amygdala\n\t40\t2\t\u22128\t13\t3.31\t3.34\tRight insula\n### Caption\nPeak voxels of significance in MdDS>CTRL and CTRL>MdDS contrasts showing unadjusted and adjusted z scores for grey matter volume.\n### Footer\nNone\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 3510214, "text_md5": "780d432ea6b4986870f19e65b7eb427d", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 76], "journal": [77, 85], "publication_year": [87, 91], "title": [102, 179], "keywords": [193, 193], "abstract": [206, 2265], "body": [2274, 31418], "tables": [31431, 32086]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 23209584, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0049560", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510214", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3510214"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510214\">3510214</a>", "list_title": "PMC3510214  Metabolic and Functional Connectivity Changes in Mal de Debarquement Syndrome"}

Although face processing has been studied extensively, brain regions responsive to age have yet to be localized. Using evocative face morphs and fMRI, we segregate two areas extending beyond the previously established face-sensitive core network, centered on the inferior temporal sulci and angular gyri bilaterally, both of which process changes of facial age. By means of probabilistic tractography, we compare their patterns of functional activation and structural connectivity. The ventral portion of Wernicke's understudied perpendicular association fasciculus is shown to interconnect the two areas, and activation within these clusters is related to the probability of fiber connectivity between them. In addition, post-hoc age-rating competence is found to be associated with high response magnitudes in the left angular gyrus. Our results provide the first evidence that facial age has a distinct representation pattern in the posterior human brain. We propose that particular face-sensitive nodes interact with additional object-unselective quantification modules to obtain individual estimates of facial age. This brain network processing the age of faces differs from the cortical areas that have previously been linked to less developmental but instantly changeable face aspects. Our probabilistic method of associating activations with connectivity patterns reveals an exemplary link that can be used to further study, assess and quantify structure-function relationships. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nProcessing the age of faces is a crucial cognitive skill. Facial age varies but not in a volatile manner like eye gaze, lip movements or facial expressions. Contrary to other fixed and variant cues  , the cognitive basis of facial age processing has not yet been investigated by any dedicated neuroimaging experiment. Facial age is depicted by complex features and configurations such as skin texture and distance from average head shape  . Localizing a brain network involved with age processing will allow us to determine whether it is primarily up to face-sensitive areas to combine low-level cues into a coherent age percept, whether this is formed by a different system altogether, or whether two or more systems interact with each other. Additionally, facial age processing may also be relevant and applicable to other networks that compute effects of magnitude and passage of time. \n\nDevelopmentally, age is less salient in faces than gender and ethnicity  . In order to augment its processing, we utilize face morphs which provide useful modulations of the age parameter: Attracting visual attention to the optical flow of such changes can be expected to enhance neural responses to every attribute of the morphed object  , and average response levels measured in virtually all face-selective regions tend to be higher for moving than for static face stimuli  \u2013 . Morphing is also suited to minimize adaptation while animations facilitate implicit processing without particular cognitive efforts, and video probes in general are increasingly adopted for stimulation in neuroimaging experiments  ,  \u2013 . Static images from graded morph transitions have already been used as a powerful tool to investigate visual processing of faces and non-face objects  \u2013  but age has either not been varied or controlled. \n\nHere, we generate continuous morphs that introduce independent age and gender changes of face stimuli. These changes are virtual but based on a fully morphable 3D model, similar to  ,  , and therefore constrained to appear smooth and realistic ( , Movie S1). Processing of facial age is compared with gender - instead of identity, attractiveness, or other changeable face aspects - for the following reasons: Gender differentiation normally changes with age and involves changes of similar complexity like aging  . By contrast, identity recognition is, within limits, age-invariant  . Furthermore, judgments of age and gender need not be affected in prosopagnosia  \u2013  but cases selectively agnostic for age while preserving gender recognition have not yet been reported. Given that categorical gender varies across androgyny levels  , both gender as well as age of a face are quantifiable but not instantly changeable. Based on the cognitive models of face processing proposed by Bruce and Young   and Ellis  \u2013 , face gender and age have both been conceptualized as \u2018visually-directed semantic codes\u2019   and their processing is here compared to each other. \n   Continuous face morphing, optical flow and associated functional activations.  \n(A) Exemplary keyframes of a video sequence (see Movie S1) morphing a 20 year-old female into a 60 year-old male. Both gradual age and gender changes are illustrated at intervals of 1 second. (B) Line magnitude images of optical flow velocities computed by the Horn-Schunck algorithm. Differential motion/optical flow was quantified as an overall parameter by the sum of flow magnitudes between successive keyframes. (C) Motion-/flow-related activations of hMT+ derived from the group-level analyses (n\u200a=\u200a24 subjects, FWER-corrected p<0.05, [\u2212log10 (p)] colorbar) on posterior cortical flat maps of both hemispheres. Additionally, ventral (v) and dorsal (d) visuotopic labels (V1\u20138, Vp, LO, hMT+) of the SuMS database, transformed from Caret's PALS atlas into FreeSurfer's average surface space, are displayed. Note that according to recent data  , V4v and V8 are labeled together as hV4 while VP has been labeled V3v. \n  \nWe use functional (fMRI) and diffusion-weighted (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the following:   (    i)    Do facial age and gender transitions engage distinct functional networks?   (    ii)    Which of the age-responsive areas are associated with high age-rating competence?    (iii)    Is the pattern of functional activation within age-responsive areas related to their connectivity? Using spatial cross-correlations between probability profiles of activation and fiber connectivity, we assess the impact of structural connections on activation patterns. Thereby, we seek to substantiate which fiber pathways transmit age-relevant information of faces. According to our results facial age processing involves distinct brain areas, connected by vertical association pathways. We suggest that face-sensitive regions may interact with quantification modules when age (but not androgyny) is varied across faces. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe obtained blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI and DWI scans of 24 healthy, right-handed, white Caucasian volunteers (age range 23 to 34, mean age 26, standard deviation 3 years; 12 females), who all gave written informed consent. The Ethics Committee of the University of W\u00fcrzburg (Faculty of Medicine) approved the study. Handedness was assessed by a variant of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory  , expanded by one eye and foot preference item  . Females were scanned between days 5 to 15 of the menstrual cycle, not taking oral contraceptives. \n\nFor validation of the tractography results, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data of additional 46 right-handed healthy volunteers (age range 19 to 63, mean age 30, standard deviation 9 years; 25 females) from the database of the Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB) were analyzed. \n\n\n### Experimental paradigm \n  \nFull-front photographs of 121 unfamiliar, unambiguously gendered faces of white Caucasians (age range 2 to 81, mean age 33, standard deviation 15 years; 60 females age-matched to the males; all free of any make-up and beardless, with eye gaze directed at the viewer, wearing no jewellery or piercings, without tattoos; rated as neutral in their expression on a 6-point visual analogue scale by all participants) were matched by a computerized algorithm  ,   to a morphable 3D model consisting of a surface mesh of editable polygons and texture materials using FaceGen Modeller v3.1 (2004, Singular Inversions Inc., Toronto,  ) and 3 ds Max 8 (2005, Autodesk Inc., San Rafael,  ). From these models, 120 face morphs were rendered. Half of them contained gender transitions. The mean age difference between start and target face of the 120 morphs was 14.8\u00b111.7 years, ranging from 0 to 46.7 years. Since all face stimuli were generated from a fully morphable 3D model  ,  , virtual faces between the start and target images appear realistic (see  , Movie S1), avoiding grotesque or bizarre distortions for intermediate morphing steps. Face stimuli were presented as shown in  . The two subjects selected have given written informed consent (as outlined in the PLoS consent form) to publication of the portrayals derived from their photographs. \n\nMorphing transitions between two faces lasted 6 seconds (see Movie S1), with an additional 1-second still in-between. Face morphs with and without gender transitions (n\u200a=\u200a60 each) were arranged in random order, with all morphs across gender proceeding from full-male/-female to the opposite. \n\nFacial age of start and target stimuli was continuously modulated, except for the one-second stills, with varying degrees and age changes being pseudo-randomized according to 10-year intervals. Age changes during morphing were independent of (i.e. orthogonal to) the transitions of gender (Pearson's normalized correlation between the modelled regressors: r\u200a=\u200a0.046, p\u200a=\u200a0.39) and the psychometric ratings of attractiveness/likeability, which was not significantly modulated (i.e. did not exceed one rating-point difference for all start/target image pairs on a 6-point visual analogue scale). Thereby, morphing eliminates the need for an explicit baseline but nevertheless allows us to separate the effects of age and gender. \n\nPsychophysical changes of age and gender were parametrically modeled according to Steven's power law (cf.   and  ). Differential motion/optical flow   was controlled for and integrated as a global nuisance variable ( ). Our experimental paradigm simultaneously engaged configural and textural processing, both known to be involved in categorical face processing  . \n   Psychometrics of facial age and gender changes.  \n(A) Facial age difference ratings (magnitude of age-gradients spanned by morphing rated on a 6-point visual analogue scale, maximum scaled to 3.0 arbitrary units [a.u.]) followed Stevens' (\u22270.3) better than Weber-Fechner's law (log10) or a natural logarithmic transformation (ln) of start and target age. All face stimuli (n\u200a=\u200a121) were morphed to an average-aged male face of 33 years, the morphing sequence was randomly played forwards or backwards for the rating (circles with error bars; n\u200a=\u200a24 subjects). (B) Facial aging (x-axis; objective age in [years]) increased the variability of subjective age ratings (y-axis; SD, standard deviation of estimated age in [years] across n\u200a=\u200a24 subjects). Rating accuracy of factual (n\u200a=\u200a121 stimuli of real faces) and interpolated age (n\u200a=\u200a80 intermediate face stimuli from the morphing algorithm; one randomly selected for each annual increment between 2 and 81 years of age) did not differ significantly (p\u200a=\u200a0.97). (C) Face gender ratings (on a 6-point visual analogue scale, maximum scaled to 1.0 arbitrary units [a.u.]) along temporal morph continua (n\u200a=\u200a60) across faces of clearly different sex. Subjective ratings by (n\u200a=\u200a24) subjects (boxes with error bars, blue line) were augmented above linear transition values (dashed line with black dots), reflecting the tendency to apperceptive gender categorization. \n     Modeling changes of age and gender during face morphing.  \nBoth were time-binned at the video frame rate (24 fps) and scaled to maxima of 1.0 arbitrary units [a.u.]. (A) Differential age change encoded according to Stevens' law of psychophysics (using a power exponent of 0.3;  ). Note that relative facial aging was up-weighted to initial periods of the example morph (also see  ; here: solid red line) and, for identical age differences, to younger absolute ages, i.e. aging from 10 to 26 was assumed to provide a stronger stimulus with more visual cues than aging from 64 to 80 years (dashed vs. double-dotted/dashed line). (B) Differential gender change expressed by the first derivative of the function plotted in  . Note that peak androgyny was defined as the effective stimulus-of-interest, i.e. the transition of facial gender was emphasized at the center of the morph (see also   and Movie S1). Half of the morphs contained no gender transitions, retaining a flat line at zero level to indicate the lack of gender change (dashed line). \n  \n\n### Paradigm presentation \n  \nThe morphing video was presented at 24 frames per second (fps) using a fMRI-compatible LCD screen, scaled to the maximum resolution of the presentation equipment (640\u00d7480 pixels VGA). The paradigm contained the entire set of 120 face morphs between different pairs of start and target faces, separated by 1-second stills, and was presented to the subjects in a single run lasting 14 minutes. Thus, the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between the offset of a 6-seconds morph and the onset of the next was 1 second, resulting in a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) or inter-trial interval (ITI) of 7 seconds with no stimulus repetitions. In order to sustain attention and to monitor compliance, subjects were instructed to press a key with their right index finger whenever the target face appearance of the morphing sequence was anticipated. Speed and accuracy were not emphasized. The explicit task was of no particular interest and only ensured that the participants attended to the paradigm. The associated activations are not reported because they are contaminated by co-activations of executive and motor functioning from key pressing. While watching the face morph of Movie S1, for example, the subject realizes that a young female is changed into an older male, and the characteristics of the target face can be anticipated before it finally appears. This may coincide with the detection of a subjective identity transition although identity virtually changes continuously in a slow but permanent manner during all morphing episodes. Note that age and gender changes were continuously modeled over the entire morphing period while subjects generally pressed the key once in anticipation of the target face, i.e. explicit task performance was sufficiently independent of implicit age and gender processing as we have modeled it. Key-press responses were recorded by a fMRI-compatible keyboard and logged by Cogent 2000 v125 (2003, Wellcome Laboratory of Neurobiology, London,  )., Global display luminance was controlled, and constant color channel ratios were maintained. Temporal synchronization between video presentation and scanning was achieved by triggering the start of each fMRI volume externally at a minimum precision of 50 \u00b5s using MATLAB R2007a (2007, The MathWorks Inc., Natick,  ). \n\n\n### MRI and behavioral data acquisition \n  \nWe acquired fMRI time-series and T1-weighted anatomical images of the (n\u200a=\u200a24) healthy volunteers in one session, and whole-brain DWI data and explicit behavioral post-hoc ratings of the same set of subjects in a second session within two weeks. In order to assess the relation between fMRI activations and age rating competence at the second level, age-rating performance was used to discriminate most accurate (n\u200a=\u200a5) from average (n\u200a=\u200a14) age-raters. \n\nFunctional and T1-weighted structural MRI data were acquired on a 3 Tesla TimTrio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a 12-channel head coil. Whole-brain T2*-weighted BOLD images were recorded by a single-shot 2D gradient-echo EPI sequence with interleaved slice acquisition (TR\u200a=\u200a2400 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a30 ms, resolution 3\u00d73\u00d74 mm , including 25% interslice gap, 30 sagittal slices of 3.2 mm thickness). After discarding the four initial scans, 350 volumes acquired during visual paradigm presentation were analyzed. In order to unwarp geometric distortions of BOLD EPIs, we used gradient-echo fieldmaps (TR\u200a=\u200a500 ms, TE1\u200a=\u200a4.30 ms, \u0394TE1/2\u200a=\u200a2.46 ms). In addition, a T1-weighted 3D anatomical image using a MPRAGE sequence (TR\u200a=\u200a1560 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a2.26 ms, resolution 1\u00d71\u00d71 mm ) optimized for segmentation and surface reconstructions and, for basic screening, a T2-weighted 2D axial FLAIR sequence were acquired. \n\nIn order to avoid potential DWI signal-loss artefacts  , we recorded whole-brain diffusion-weighted EPI volumes (60 diffusion directions isotropically distributed on a sphere at b\u200a=\u200a1000 s/mm , TR\u200a=\u200a9000 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a97 ms, resolution 2\u00d72\u00d72.5 mm , including 20% interslice gap, 60 axial slices) and five volumes without diffusion weighting on a 1.5 Tesla Quantum Vision scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). For unwarping their geometric distortions, gradient-echo fieldmaps matching the DWI protocol were used (TR\u200a=\u200a325 ms, TE1\u200a=\u200a4.30 ms, \u0394TE1/2\u200a=\u200a4.76 ms). \n\nDWI data of the independent database were acquired on a 1.5 Tesla Sonata scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with similar sequence parameters at slightly lower slice thickness (resolution2\u00d72\u00d72 mm , 72 axial slices). Three sets of DWI data were recorded for subsequent averaging to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (total scan time 45 minutes). \n\n\n### Preprocessing and statistical analysis \n  \nAll MRI data were processed using FSL 4.1 ( ;  ,  ) and FreeSurfer v4.5.0 ( ,  ). First-level fMRI and DWI data were motion- and eddy current-corrected (using MCFLIRT   and eddy_correct, respectively), unwarped (using PRELUDE/FUGUE) and brain-extracted (using BET  ; all part of FSL). First-level fMRI analysis was carried out by applying the General Linear Model (GLM) within FEAT using FILM prewhitening  , with motion outliers (detected by fsl_motion_outliers) being added as confound regressors. High-pass temporal filtering of the data and the model was set to 100 secs based on the power spectra of the design matrices (estimated by cutoffcalc; all part of FSL). Three main explanatory variables were modeled and controlled: Optical flow, age and gender change. Parametric intensity modulation of their graded stimulus strength is described below, linear modeling of age and gender changes did not explain a significant amount of variance on top of this. Button press responses to anticipated target face appearance were also modeled but of no further interest. In order to capture slight deviations from the model, temporal derivatives of all explanatory variables convolved with FEAT's gamma hemodynamic response function (HRF) were included. \n\nIn order to take advantage of surface-based registrations and statistical analyses, FreeSurfer was used for segmentation and surface reconstructions of the structural T1-weighted MRIs. Employing boundary-based registration (using bbregister, part of FreeSurfer,  ), robust and accurate within-subject cross-modal alignment of functional and anatomical space was achieved. Concatenating this transformation with the surface-based registration to FreeSurfer's spherical average  , FEAT's first-level contrast-of-parameter estimates (COPEs) and their variance estimates (VARCOPEs) were resampled to the common fsaverage surface. Surface-based spatial smoothing of 5 mm FWHM was applied. At the group level, a mixed-effects (ME) GLM analysis   was performed (using mri_glmfit, part of FreeSurfer) identifying vertices in which brain activity was correlated with age, gender and optical flow processing. Second-level thresholding was performed by non-parametric permutation-based cluster mass inference  \u2013  and included within-contrast correction for multiple comparisons across all vertices of the fsaverage surface. Across the contrasts tested, Bonferroni's correction was applied which further enforced rigorous protection from false-positive detections. Interactions between the main explanatory variables of interest (age and gender change, optical flow) were modeled at the first and assessed at the second level. The volunteers' gender was explicitly modeled at the second level to test for differences between the sexes. Only results with family-wise error rate (FWER) corrected p-values<0.05 are reported, coordinates are given in MNI standard space. \n\nRelative response magnitudes were quantified based on individual mean within-cluster contrast-of-parameter estimates (COPEs) normalized to the respective minimum, see  . Scaled to the peak-to-peak height of the effective regressor and divided by the mean-over-time of the preprocessed (i.e. filtered) EPI time-series from lower-level GLM analyses, mean COPE values are equivalent to mean percentage BOLD signal changes and characterize the observed effect sizes. Given constant scaling for a particular contrast fitted, normalized COPE values translate directly into estimated ratios of the associated signal changes within (but not across) specific contrasts. First-level COPEs from each cluster were tested for hemisphere and sex effects (n\u200a=\u200a24; ANOVA, factorial within-/across-subjects design). \n   Functional activations associated with changes of facial age and gender.  \n(A) Group-level (n\u200a=\u200a24) functional activations  related to age and gender change, respectively. (B) Quantification and between-cluster/-hemisphere comparisons of observed effect sizes evoked by facial age and gender changes across (n\u200a=\u200a24) subjects. Individual values of each cluster's mean activation (\u00b1 error bars across subjects) were normalized to the lowest average of corresponding response magnitudes (as extracted from the first-level analyses). (C) Increased age-related activations  of the most accurate (n\u200a=\u200a5) above average age-raters (n\u200a=\u200a14). The corresponding cortical flat map is outlined by the borders of the left age-responsive pANG cluster. (D) Relative to average post-hoc raters (avg, n\u200a=\u200a14), high explicit age-rating accuracy (upper quintile P80, n\u200a=\u200a5) was accompanied by almost five times the response magnitude during implicit age-change processing within left pANG (p<0.001, based on mean individual activation levels of the sub-cluster shown in  , as back-projected to native subject space). Activations of lower quintile raters (P20, n\u200a=\u200a5) were more variable but not statistically different from the average (P20\u201380).  Significant activations (FWER-corrected p<0.05) displayed on FreeSurfer's average inflated surface (color bars depict uncorrected activation probabilities [\u2212log10 (p)]). pANG, posterior angular gyrus area; pITS, posterior inferior temporal sulcus; DLPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; LOT, lateral occipito-temporal area; FFG, fusiform gyrus; orientation labels: L, left; R, right. \n  \nDWI data were processed using FMRIB's Diffusion Toolbox (FDT, part of FSL). Up to two fiber orientations were modeled and the corresponding probabilistic distributions of diffusion parameters were built up at each voxel (using bedpostx, part of FDT). Probabilistic modeling of multiple fiber orientations   was essential because of crossing fibers in the areas under examination. Subsequently, probabilistic tractography was performed by probtrackx (part of FDT) on the same (n\u200a=\u200a24) as well as independent (n\u200a=\u200a46) subjects included for replication, to investigate structural connectivity between cortical regions related to either age or gender processing. After transforming functional clusters obtained at the second level back to the individual surface space of the anatomical scans, each cluster mask was defined as a seed with all the others serving as potential targets. Probabilistic streamlines were seeded directly from surface vertices. A total of 10\u22274 samples was sent out from each tracking point. Stop and waypoint masking was used to exclude indirect routes. Upon slight spatial smoothing (2 mm FWHM), probabilistic seed-to-target connectivities were then averaged on FreeSurfer's common fsaverage surface. Probabilistic pathways were transformed to MNI space, added and thresholded for visualization (using FSL's non-linear 1 mm MNI template as target space; see 3D-tract volume rendering, thresholded at \u2265100 connecting samples passing through each voxel, displayed on sagittal [x\u200a=\u200a\u221236 mm] and coronal [y\u200a=\u200a\u221254 mm] projection view planes in  ). \n   Association pathways subserving facial age processing.  \nVentral portion of Wernicke's perpendicular fasciculus (WpF) connecting pANG and pITS (average probabilistic path distributions connecting the functional clusters; n\u200a=\u200a24, 3D-tract volume rendering thresholded at \u2265100 connecting samples passing through each voxel, displayed on sagittal [x\u200a=\u200a\u221236 mm] and coronal [y\u200a=\u200a\u221254 mm] projection view planes in MNI standard space). pANG, posterior angular gyrus area; pITS, posterior inferior temporal sulcus; orientation labels: L, left; R, right. \n  \nUtilizing spatial cross-correlations between functional activation probability values and tractography-based connectivity scores, we examine if the activation pattern of one area that processes facial age is predicted by its intrinsic structural connectivity with another, i.e. evidence for two selected areas directly interacting with each other as connections to the latter determine activations of the former and vice versa. The rationale behind this analysis was that if the spatial profile of a connection between A and B predicts the activation profile in A, then this suggests that the connection between A and B is indeed involved in brain processes producing the activation in A. Because fiber pathways, even when connecting A and B, do not have to participate in the processing, and because functional activations of A and B can be associated with each other in the absence of direct structural connectivity, we don't expect perfect spatial correspondence of functional and connectional probability profiles. But if detectable, significant correspondence of functional and connectivity profiles should emphasize the functional importance of a tract between A and B. Gender processing is again used for within- and across-condition comparison. \n\nVertex-wise spatial cross-correlations between functional and structural profiles provide a quantitative measure for the association of the two (cf.  ) and were calculated non-parametrically using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (\u03c1). All p-values were Bonferroni-corrected for the total number of tests performed. Since lower false-positive activation error probabilities reflect higher activation likelihoods, i.e. higher positive t-values and z-scores, absolute log10 (p)-values were used for correlation. \n   Surface-based cross-correlation of fMRI activation probabilities and structural connectivities.  \nSpatial cross-correlation plots (\u00b1 SEM)  between activation probabilities ([\u2212log10(p)]) and structural connectivity scores ([log10(cs/ns)], with [(cs/ns)] reflecting ratios of connecting samples to the number of samples sent out from each vertex) for pANG, pITS and FFG (cf.  ), based on two samples: (n\u200a=\u200a24) paired with functional data [red] and (n\u200a=\u200a46) independent subjects [blue]. Connectivity ratios tend to get bound earlier at maximum values than corresponding activation probabilities. Positive correlations were slightly stronger for the sample with paired fMRI and DWI data (n\u200a=\u200a24) compared to the independent sample from the FMRIB DWI database (n\u200a=\u200a46; with Spearman's \u03c1 displayed for the paired/independent sample when significant). However, the latter largely replicate and confirm generalizability of the results.

Age and gender change were time-binned at the video frame-rate (24 fps). Scaling of each regressor was set to a relative maximum of 1. In order to determine accurate stimulus response functions, especially for age and gender, we extensively evaluated our paradigm and the stimuli employed by various psychometric ratings (see Behavioral Results). Thereby, we empirically identified unbiased stimulus response functions for age and gender, later used for modeling in the fMRI analysis. \n\nAs illustrated in   and  , we modeled the age-related changes between start and target faces dependent on their psychophysical age difference. By transforming absolute age using an empirically derived power exponent of 0.3 according to Steven's law, our psychophysical response function accounted for the fact that aging during the first 20 years of life involves more visible changes than from 60 to 80, for example. The power exponent of 0.3 was empirically derived from our psychometric data (see below). According to these psychometric results, absolute facial age is best converted according to Steven's law using 0.3 for exponential transformation to estimate the psychophysical age gradient between start and target face (cf.  ). For the 6-seconds morphs and based on the psychometric results, the unsigned first derivative is used (cf.  ). Using the unsigned first derivative is based on the psychometrically tested assumption that the interpolated age of intermediate virtual frames between the start and target face morphed into each other is not differently perceived than the age of real faces (cf.  ). Thus, our stimulus response function models stronger the age-related activations the higher the psychophysical age gradient between two faces morphed into each other. Based on our psychometric results and in good accordance with previously published data  , gender was modeled similarly by the unsigned first derivative of linear androgyny levels encoded by Steven's law using 3 for exponential transformation (see below). \n\nOptical flow  , representing the total amount of motion between successive keyframes of the paradigm, was separately modeled to reduce the amount of unexplained variance which would confound the analysis if all morphing transitions were treated the same. On top of age and gender, optical flow during morphing differs between different pairs of start and target faces. Therefore, the full set of visual stimuli containing the (n\u200a=\u200a120) continuous morph sequences displayed in the fMRI paradigm was fed into a customized Simulink V6.6 (2007, The MathWorks Inc., Natick,  ) model estimating optical flow between successive video keyframes by a Horn-Schunck algorithm   based on flow velocities using MATLAB's video and image processing blockset with 30 iterations per pair. First, a vector field representing the inter-keyframe motion was extracted, as illustrated by flow magnitude lines in  . Then, the vector field was converted to a binary mask. The sum of absolute flow values within that mask described the total amount of motion between successive keyframes of the paradigm and was robustly estimated as a surrogate parameter of overall flow intensity at one-second intervals. Note that optical flow detection on a frame-by-frame basis becomes less robust, i.e. time-binning above 1 fps does not improve the results. Given that all pixels exhibiting optical flow cannot be entered as separate explanatory variables to preserve sufficient degrees-of-freedom for the analysis, and considering that expansions and contractions involved in our face morphing were quite smooth, i.e. cross-correlated, optical flow was estimated at 1 fps and integrated as a nuisance regressor into our paradigm. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThis section is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on the psychometric behavioral data and, based upon these, on modeling the psychophysical changes of the main explanatory variables. \n\nThe second part covers the related functional activations, as derived from the same set of (n\u200a=\u200a24) subjects, and the structural connectivity between them, i.e. the neuroimaging results of the study. \n\n### Psychometric Results \n  \n#### Age rating and the age regressor \n  \nFor the psychometric assessment, we instructed our volunteers to rate their subjective impression of how much facial age actually changed across morph sequences spanning an age spectrum similar to the original fMRI paradigm. In order to minimize the potential rating bias, the (n\u200a=\u200a121) face stimuli were morphed to another average-aged male face of 33 years not contained in the original stimulus set. Therefore, the subjects were familiar with the set of faces used as start and targets in the fMRI video paradigm but not with the particular morphs displayed in the psychometric rating. Single start-to-target morphs were randomly played forwards or backwards for the rating, and the corresponding results are plotted in  . \n\nOn a 6-point visual analogue scale, subjective age-gradient ratings for the (n\u200a=\u200a121) separate face morphs were best encoded according to Stevens' law of psychophysics  . Here, the perceived magnitude of age gradients spanned by the morphs was related to the difference between start and target age, both best transformed by a power exponent of 0.3 (cf.  ). For infinitesimal small bins during continuous morphing, psychophysical age change then corresponds to the unsigned first derivative of absolute facial ages (range: 2 to 81 years) encoded by Steven's law using 0.3 for exponential transformation. Given that it remains unclear to what extent facial age estimates are based on local feature, internal configuration, texture and global shape processing  ,  \u2013 , this was considered the optimal approach to implement and model continuous changes of facial age. Deviations from linear transition values reflect the fact that the subjective perception of facial aging is relatively up-weighted to initial morphing periods and younger absolute ages ( ). Applied to age changes within individuals, for which only very limited data of unstandardized and scarcely suitable images are available  , this would reflect a modeling bias towards the earlier development of face shape that prevails over textural changes such as wrinkle formation during later aging  , or their removal by cosmetic rejuvenation. Across individuals and their shape differences, however, configural processing was not forced into any overt advantage over featural processing (see also the flow magnitude lines in  ). Both are difficult to completely separate and parameterize for facial age and aging. \n\nIn a second rating, the task was to estimate the age of (n\u200a=\u200a201) face stills in years. For this purpose, stills of all (n\u200a=\u200a121) real faces and of (n\u200a=\u200a80) interpolated age models were displayed randomly. In both of these stimulus samples, i.e. the real and interpolated age models, facial aging increased subjective age rating variability across our (n\u200a=\u200a24) subjects similar to the group-ratings of young and old faces reported by Ebner  , see  . No significant difference between real and interpolated faces was detected and exponential fitting revealed congruent curves. \n\n\n#### Age rating competence \n  \nBased on the actual distribution of rating errors accumulated over all stills, we trichotomized according to upper and lower quintile cutoffs in order to relate age rating performance to fMRI activations (see below). Because implicit age-change processing (during the fMRI experiment) is rather unlikely to strongly correlate with explicit age-rating accuracy in post-hoc assessments of a limited sample size, this was not more rigorously modeled. The upper quintile of most accurate age-raters (n\u200a=\u200a5) was compared to average performers (n\u200a=\u200a14). The lower quintile of below-average raters (P20, n\u200a=\u200a5) was excluded. Confirmed by their own verbal report, their compliance and motivation was limited at the second session so that age-rating performance of these subjects did not correspond to their actual capacities. This was reflected in disproportionally higher post-hoc rating errors and an increased rating variability (low accuracy \u2264P20: 9.1\u00b10.8, average accuracy >P20/<P80: 7.1\u00b10.5 and high accuracy \u2265P80: 5.7\u00b10.5 years, as averaged over trials). \n\n\n#### Gender rating and the gender regressor \n  \nIn order to investigate the psychophysical processing of gender, especially at intermediate ambiguous levels, (n\u200a=\u200a119) sample faces along temporal morph continua across gender from the (n\u200a=\u200a60) transsexual morphing sequences were rated by the volunteers on a 6-point visual analogue scale according to their subjective impression of facial gender/androgyny levels. In accordance with previous reports  , subjective gender levels were augmented above linear transition values reflecting the tendency to apperceptive categorization ( ). Gender-level ratings of the faces followed Stevens' power law just as age but were best fitted by a power exponent of 3 along the temporal morph continuum which is also in good agreement with the published data  . Perceived gender change while morphing thus simply depends on the difference of androgyny levels between time-points. For infinitesimal small bins during continuous morphing towards mid-androgyny between two clearly gendered faces, psychophysical gender change is then described by the unsigned first derivative of absolute androgyny levels (range: 0 to 1), encoded by Steven's law using 3 for exponential transformation (cf.  ). Note that contrary to previous modeling  , peak androgyny was defined as the effective stimulus-of-interest because recognition of face gender transitions is particularly emphasized at the center of such morphs, see   and  . Slight deviations from the center peak were captured by including the temporal derivative (see Material and Methods). Since pre-pubertal faces tend to appear less gendered the younger they are, androgyny peaks while morphing can be shifted to very young faces. Similarly, very old faces, especially when seen without hairstyle, may be liable to a male classification bias. Modeling a temporal derivative accounted for these effects and avoided a bias in testing age-by-gender interactions. \n\n\n\n### Neuroimaging Results \n  \n#### Functional activations associated with optical flow \n  \nInclusion of optical flow as a nuisance variable enabled us to account for low-level configural and featural changes during face morphing which would otherwise have confounded the analysis. Optical flow was associated with functional activations in the motion-sensitive cortex (hMT+), see   and  , that is known to respond stronger than any other area to radial motion, 2D expansions and contractions of objects  ,  \u2013 . Functional (hMT+) activations related to optical flow are shown on bilateral flat maps in   with additional visuotopic labels  ,   of the SuMS   database ( ) to facilitate orientation and to illustrate the spatial correspondence of our clusters with the hMT+ atlas labels. \n   Synopsis of functional activations related to age, gender and motion/optical flow.        \n\n#### Functional activations associated with facial age and interactions \n  \nAge change-related activations were centered on the posterior inferior temporal sulcus (pITS), lateral to the fusiform gyrus (FFG), and on the posterior angular gyrus area (pANG) of both hemispheres; see   and  . Age change, but not the gender condition, was found to be associated with higher mean left-hemispheric activations (p\u200a=\u200a0.04, ANOVA, condition-by-hemisphere interaction;  ). Apart from that, no other significant condition-by-hemisphere interactions, no significant differences between male and female volunteers and no significant positive or negative interactions between the variables-of-interest age, gender and optical flow or their relative response magnitudes, i.e. normalized effect size values, were detected. Note that the fact that we did not detect a gender-by-age interaction may be related to our specific modeling approach and our stimulus set of clearly gendered faces. The latter limited high androgyny levels to morphs with gender transitions and thereby the power to detect such interaction. \n\n\n#### Age-responsive areas associated with high age-rating competence \n  \nWithin left pANG, a sub-cluster above the superior temporal sulcus (STS) discriminated the upper quintile (P80, n\u200a=\u200a5) of best explicit age raters from average performers (P20\u201380, n\u200a=\u200a14) by higher activations, see   and  . Here, superior explicit age-rating competence of upper quintile performers corresponded to an enhanced mean response magnitude in their activation level associated with facial age, which was augmented by more than fourfold relative to average raters (as illustrated in  ). The lower quintile (P20, n\u200a=\u200a5), which was not included in this specific second-level assessment based on the behavioral data, exhibited the highest variability of corresponding relative fMRI response magnitudes (shown by increased error bars in  ). The more pronounced fMRI response variability of these below-average age raters emphasizes their heterogeneity and presumed underperformance with respect to their actual capacities, which had prompted their exclusion from this part of the analysis (see Behavioral Results above). \n\n\n#### Functional activations associated with facial gender \n  \nGender change-related activations were detected within FFG bilaterally, see   and  , amplifying previous evidence for graded gender responses of the FFG and fusiform face area (FFA)  ,  . Notably, increased face androgyny during across-sex morph transitions activated above the more differentiated gender levels (cf.  ), and not vice versa as for static stimuli  , illustrating the context dependency of the functional activations. In addition, the right lateral occipitotemporal area (LOT), already implicated by an early PET study  , and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were involved (  and  ). \n\n\n#### Structural connections between age- and gender-related clusters \n  \nFor each subject, probabilistic tractography was run between all age and gender change-related clusters on individual brain surface reconstructions. An association tract, the ventral portion of Wernicke's perpendicular fasciculus  , was found to interconnect pANG and pITS ( ). Its almost vertically running fibers connect the posterior inferior parietal lobule, namely the angular gyrus (\u2018pli courbe\u2019), and the parieto-occipital transition, namely the second parieto-occipital \u2018pli de passage\u2019 of Gratiolet  , with the inferior temporal area  . Other cortico-cortical pathways, such as fibers of the superior longitudinal and fronto-occipital fasciculi connecting FFG, pANG and DLPFC (schematically displayed in  ), are not rendered for display and revealed lower connectivities (see log-transformed connectivity scores in  ), except for clusters located very close to each other (e.g., FFG and LOT). Commissure connectivities between clusters related to age or gender processing remained negligible, i.e. less than 0.1\u2030 of the total number of samples sent out from seed vertices reached the targets (n\u200a=\u200a32 pathways of homo-, e.g. right\u2194left pITS, and heterotopic, e.g. right pANG\u2194left pITS, commissures extracted). \n   Left-hemispheric nodes of the presumed brain network processing the age of faces.  \n3D model illustrating how the ventral stream, pITS in particular, may interact via Wernicke's perpendicular fasciculus (WpF) with the posterior magnitude-encoding and approximate number system  ,  , pANG in particular, to quantify the varying age of faces. FFG exhibits some connectivity to pANG (cf.  ) but is primarily engaged in processing fixed face attributes such as categorical gender (even if continuously changed over variable androgyny levels like in  ; see also  ,   and  ). pANG, posterior angular gyrus area; pITS, posterior inferior temporal sulcus; DLPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; LOT, lateral occipitotemporal area; FFG, fusiform gyrus; 17\u201319, Brodmann's areas forming three visual tiers; hMT+, human motion-sensitive temporal cortex; ITG/MTG/STG, inferior/middle/superior temporal gyrus; ITS/STS, inferior/superior temporal sulcus. \n  \n\n#### Linking connectivity and activation patterns \n  \nThe connectivity between functionally defined seed- and target-clusters was quantified by counting how many connecting samples arrived at every vertex of the target (from any vertex of the steed), yielding an index for every target vertex. In order to characterize the extent to which different structural seed-to-target connectivities relate to activation patterns, we then examined the vertex-wise spatial cross-correlations between surface connectivity scores and activation probabilities, i.e. the above connectivity index was correlated (plotted) against the activation probability of the target vertices in   (see Materials and Methods). This is based on the hypothesis that if there is a direct structural connection between a pair of functional regions, where this connection itself is involved in the cerebral processing, then locations of highest fMRI activation probability within the regions should be close to the highest probability of structural connectivity between them, i.e. the patterns of functional activations and anatomical connectivity should be positively correlated. We tested this hypothesis on all clusters responsive to age and gender change. \n\nAt the group level, by far most consistent spatial cross-correlations between activation probabilities and average connectivity scores were detected for pANG and pITS (cf.  ; results exclusively shown for association pathways of Wernicke's perpendicular fasciculus between pANG, pITS and FFG). Thus, for pANG, lowest type I activation error probabilities were in proximity to high pITS connectivity, indicating pITS' ability to directly recruit pANG for age processing and vice versa. In addition to pANG and pITS   within   the age-change condition of both hemispheres (  and  ), significant but lower positive vertex-wise spatial cross-correlations of activation probabilities and connectivity values were only found in the right hemisphere for the pANG and LOT cluster (0.10\u2264\u03c1\u22640.18 for pANG\u2194LOT; not shown). Furthermore, activations of the pANG cluster revealed potentially relevant associations with connections to FFG, especially on the left, but just on this tractography seeding end (i.e. FFG activations were   not   consistently related to their pANG connectivity; see spatial cross-correlation plots in  ), and pANG's overall connectivity to the FFG cluster remained comparatively low. These connections, which were originally discovered by Wernicke   based on anatomical examination of monkey brains   and later demonstrated to form part of the stratum verticale convexitatis in men  , correspond to fibers of Wernicke's perpendicular fasciculus between the angular and fusiform gyri  . Commissure connectivities (n\u200a=\u200a32 homo- and heterotopic pathways; see above) were also tested but revealed no significant vertex-wise spatial cross-correlations with corresponding activation probabilities. Because cluster size and distance effects are hard to disentangle from meaningful inter-hemispheric differences, we did not test for differences between surface-based spatial cross-correlations of fMRI activation probabilities and structural connectivities across the two hemispheres. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur investigation provides the first description of a distinct brain network associated with processing the age of faces and its underlying structural connectivity. Although facial age is of high social relevance and has been shown to influence medial prefrontal activations when presumed personality characteristics are rated  , the neural basis of facial age processing itself has not previously been identified. According to our data, its primary cortical components \u2013 the areas around pITS and pANG \u2013 are separate from those processing categorical gender while face-selective FFA activations have recently been shown to be primarily predicted by inferotemporal connectivity of the FFG  . Notably, the age-processing network, i.e. pITS   together with   pANG, also expands the proposed core system representing other variable face aspects (such as eye gaze; unvaried and directed at the viewer in our fMRI study) which are ready to change instantly under attentional, emotional or volitional instead of ontogenetic control  ,  . It may also augment the extended system, as previously conceptualized, which has been suggested to mediate spatially directed attention and recognition of emotions in faces, for example  . \n\n### Structural within-network connectivity \n  \nWernicke's perpendicular fasciculus (WpF) has been recognized as a separate cerebral association tract but so far largely escaped further description and attention  . Only its more posterior occipital portion has been implied as part of a disconnection syndrome potentially underlying cases of pure alexia  . Compared to other association tracts, it runs in a peculiar vertical instead of horizontal trajectory which enables it to interconnect ventral and dorsal parallel pathways  , see   and  . Despite the known limitations and inaccuracies of DWI-based tractography  , our main finding that brain activity spatially correlates with connectivity between pITS and pANG substantiates our claim that the structural connection of these two cortical areas by WpF's ventral portion is of real functional importance   in vivo  . Specifically, our results suggest that this association pathway may be linked to facial age processing (see below). \n\n\n### Methodological Limitations \n  \nGiven that tractography cannot reveal directions of information processing, our data do not ensure that it is pITS that recruits pANG and not vice versa. Continuous morphing, despite its strength of presumably augmenting change-sensitive neural responses and supporting our explicit psychophysiological model, precludes reliable detection of temporal delay differences between pITS and pANG. Thus, we acknowledge that these clusters may influence each other reciprocally, as schematically indicated in  , a fact that is generally assumed for most cortical areas connected by association tracts. \n\nDue to the inherent smoothness of fMRI data, which is further pronounced on the average surface, and because connectivity probabilities tend to increase the closer seed and target are located, association of probabilistic connectivity and activation probabilities for extremely short association fibers and cortical regions located very near to each other (e.g., right LOT and pITS   across   the age and gender condition) may be inflated. In fact, at a liberal threshold (p\u200a=\u200a0.05, uncorrected for multiple comparisons) the right age-related pITS activation extends into the ipsilateral gender-related LOT cluster, and nearby parts of these two clusters are also vigorously interconnected. This suggests that right LOT, to some extent, may participate in age processing. Similarly, connectivity of gender-responsive FFG to nearby pITS (not shown) and pANG ( ) may be relevant for facial age processing. In having identified potential key components of these circuitries, our study may serve as a precursor for future studies of effective functional connectivity between such sets of areas, e.g. by using dynamic causal modeling (DCM). Interestingly, apparent face gender is normally fixed for a given individual (except in early developmental stages and transsexuals): Changes of face gender are virtually always and inevitably associated with changes of personal identity. Consistent with it and the presented results, both gender and identity processing have been strongly associated to FFG/FFA  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 . The fact that our data on the processing of face gender (which also changed continuously in our experiment) largely replicates previous results obtained by static stimuli  ,  ,  ,   and that neither our age nor gender condition involved the right anterior STS (which has been shown to exclusively respond to moving faces)  ,   further strengthens the conclusion that we have indeed detected a brain network processing the age of faces and not other unstable features (such as the movement within the faces) or subliminal changes of identity. This corroboration is important, since people do not normally age in front of our eyes, and adaptation experiments have indicated the potential recruitment of more widely distributed brain regions   and the area around the STS even in identity processing  . However, the latter finding is not supported by other data   and would, contrary to our findings, also be expected to affect our gender condition. \n\n\n### Interpretation \n  \nA unique combination of fMRI and diffusion tractography measurements enabled us not only to track anatomical connections between peak activations but also to uncover significant spatial cross-correlations between functional activations on the one hand and structural connectivity probabilities on the other. The demonstration of such associations between functional and probabilistic connectivity measures, which has only recently been highlighted by a different hypothesis and approach  ,  , may further assist the understanding of relations between fMRI activations and cerebral connectivity. For example, this type of association in the localization of function and structure can substantiate evidence for fiber tracts being directly involved in transmitting condition-relevant information which has not previously been proposed or analyzed. Our data suggest that age-relevant information may be transmitted between pITS and pANG by the anterior division of Wernicke's perpendicular fasciculus to which no unambiguous function has yet been attributed. \n\nOur results allow us to propose the first coherent model (illustrated in  ) for how the ventral visual stream may interact with the angular gyrus area to process different facial ages. Changing within as well as across individuals, age is automatically quantified and attributed particularly to faces, i.e. more precisely than for any other object. We propose that facial age is represented in terms of growing quantities and contrastable numerical magnitudes. By utilizing the ventral part of Wernicke's perpendicular fasciculus, a largely understudied association tract, age-responsive pITS gains access to pANG, posterior processing core of a common quantification network outlined in a theory of magnitude (ATOM)   and part of an approximate number system (ANS)  . Neither pITS nor pANG are likely to process facial age exclusively, and both areas are certainly not only devoted to decode the age of faces, yet our findings indicate their spatially coherent involvement in its implicit processing across subjects. Sparse data from brain-lesioned patients   indicate that the posterior right brain may be crucial for (ap-)perceptive component of age processing. Increased left-hemispheric responses (shown in  ) and higher activation levels of most accurate raters above the superior temporal sulcus within left pANG only (cf.  ), on the other hand, correspond to a known importance of the left angular gyrus for abstract number representations, quantized discrete decoding, numerical comparisons and operations  ,  , as well as high mental calculation abilities  . These findings do not disambiguate which lower-level brain regions and face features (e.g., wrinkle quantity, skin texture, or head cast with different developmental face-to-skull proportions) contribute to the encoding of facial age. Nevertheless, they may suggest that the age-responsive network assembles and eventually integrates these inputs into comparable and estimable magnitudes particularly within pANG, by different contributions from the right and left hemisphere. Contrary to the static and dynamic processing of other face object categorizations and discriminations  ,  , average responses related to facial age were more pronounced and robust in the left hemisphere, and age-rating performance was also associated with left brain functioning of pANG. \n\nConsidering the extraordinary relevance of age judgements for the interpersonal domain, e.g. to establish peer communication, attractiveness and even empathy, the cognitive processing of facial age and aging reflects an intrinsic core capacity of the human \u201csocial brain\u201d. Its functions have also been related to the temporo-parietal junction. Attractiveness, which has not been modulated in our study, is influenced by facial age  ,  . It has been, among other brain areas, associated with the STS. However, activation peaks reported for attractiveness judgements   were located superior to those of pITS and more anterior to those of pANG (see  ). Obviously, faces of the same age are differently attractive, and attractiveness per se has not been shown to evoke unequivocal activations  . Furthermore, the brain network proposed by us to process facial age clearly differs from the largely reward-related systems that have been implied in association with beauty  \u2013 . \n\n\n### Outlook and Conclusions \n  \nFuture investigations and lesion studies are required to further elucidate cognitive age processing. Our analysis may be broadened by other approaches examining distributed patterns of neural age-encoding in their selectiveness and specificity but this would have been beyond the scope of this study. More elaborate insights can be anticipated investigating age discrimination upon face inversion, processing the age of non-face objects, adaptation to age, own- vs. other-age effects including associated visual processing strategies and their potential center-periphery bias, cross-modal integration of age information, age processing in the blind, dissociation of non-abstract and numerical age representations, and the development of age-recognition expertise. Even though our study highlights pANG as one key component for age processing, its precise role in this context is still speculative and needs further investigation. Our model, illustrated in  , gives rise to interesting hypotheses: One testable prediction would be that disruption of left pANG activity using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), for example, should impair numerical age but not gender judgements, and that brain lesion-symptom mapping can eventually dissociate the two. On the other hand, our model of separate brain networks processing age and gender (cf.  ) would be falsified if dissociations of age from gender agnosia cannot be confirmed. Consistent with our proposed model of segregated neural systems for gender and age processing, Bruyer & Schweich describe a patient with prosopagnosia secondary to a right temporo-occipital brain haemorrhage (most likely affecting right LOFA +/\u2212 FFG according to their description) who exhibited deficient gender categorization but in whom age classification was preserved  . Another assumption would be that activity of at least parts of the network processing the age of faces is incremental with low-level cues, such as wrinkle formation and head proportions, with more cues giving rise to higher activation levels in these areas. Such low-level cues determining facial age perception may be modulated con- and divergently. Finally, pANG (but not pITS?) may be involved in the processing of age and aging for non-face stimuli, like other body parts or inanimated objects. \n\nThe notion of a distributed neural core system processing fixed attributes vs. changeable aspects of faces   parallels the traditional logic of distinguishing essential from non-essential object properties. In this regard, facial age may be considered an auxiliary appearance, conveying non-symbolic, abstract and social information. As is the case with gender and identity, age does not need to be constantly ascertained in another's face and is not reproduced or \u201cmirrored\u201c by the perceiver. Therefore, its regular processing presumably relies less on permanent monitoring required to follow eye gaze, lip-speech or facial expressions   for which predictable motion trajectories may be anticipated  . Our results can be interpreted to discover a genuine set of the face-processing ensemble: the posterior inferior sulcus within the extrastriate system of visual face analysis that interacts via Wernicke's perpendicular fasciculus with extended modules of the angular gyrus area to represent the age of faces. \n\n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0049451-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\themi\tcluster\tsize\tCWP\tMax\tVtxMax\tMNI X, Y, Z\tMNI X, Y, Z.1\tMNI X, Y, Z.2\tvE/BA\tannotation\nage\tleft\tpANG\t2309\t0.0001\t8.739\t142332\t\u221241.0\t\u221274.5\t27.0\tPG/39\tinferior parietal\n\t\tpITS\t526\t0.0001\t7.307\t40331\t\u221254.1\t\u221255.8\t\u22128.5\tPH/37\tinferior temporal\n\tright\tpANG\t1177\t0.0001\t8.465\t117820\t46.7\t\u221259.3\t19.5\tPG/39\tinferior parietal\n\t\tpITS\t367\t0.0004\t6.025\t5665\t54.2\t\u221253.5\t\u22129.4\tPH/37\tinferior temporal\nrating*\tleft\tpANG*\t32\t0.0133\t5.045\t146872\t\u221242.4\t\u221256.6\t25.5\tPG/39\tinferior parietal\ngender\tleft\tDLPFC\t370\t0.0005\t5.948\t29235\t\u221236.9\t19.5\t22.1\tFD/46\tinf. front. sulcus\n\t\tFFG\t228\t0.002\t5.437\t92500\t\u221239.1\t\u221267.9\t\u221217.2\tPH/37\tfusiform\n\tright\tLOT\t862\t0.0001\t5.988\t35952\t42.4\t\u221277.3\t\u22125.4\tOA/19\tlateral occipital\n\t\tFFG\t202\t0.0021\t5.107\t28527\t36.4\t\u221256.0\t\u221216.4\tPH/37\tfusiform\nmotion\tleft\thMT+\t605\t0.0001\t8.816\t551\t\u221242.6\t\u221279.6\t0.1\tOA/19\tmiddle occipital\n\tright\thMT+\t1204\t0.0001\t8.554\t91197\t46.7\t\u221258.9\t0.4\tPHO/19\tmiddle temporal\n### Caption\nSynopsis of functional activations related to age, gender and motion/optical flow.\n### Footer\nClusters significantly activated by changes of facial age, gender and motion/optical flow (FWER-corrected p<0.05 for n\u200a=\u200a24 subjects)1.1hemi, hemisphere; size in [mm2], CWP, cluster-wise probability (non-parametric cluster mass inference over the entire surface; [ ]); Max, peak activation probability (absolute log10-maximum of uncorrected p-values: \u2212log10(p); [ ]); VtxMax, vertex of Max on Freesurfer's average surface; MNI, coordinates in MNI standard space [mm]; vE/BA, [113]/[114] area; annotation, anatomical labels; pANG, posterior angular gyrus area (*sub-cluster related to high age-rating competence); pITS, posterior inferior temporal sulcus; DLPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; LOT, lateral occipitotemporal area; FFG, fusiform gyrus; hMT+, human motion-sensitive MT+ (V5 or MT/MST) area.\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 3502502, "text_md5": "9b2123b626eb8b543caaf3f9abb115b4", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 85], "journal": [86, 94], "publication_year": [96, 100], "title": [111, 154], "keywords": [168, 168], "abstract": [181, 1771], "body": [1780, 60660], "tables": [60673, 62537]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 23185334, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0049451", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3502502", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3502502"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3502502\">3502502</a>", "list_title": "PMC3502502  A Brain Network Processing the Age of Faces"}

Increasing evidence shows that the insula plays an important role in depression. We aimed to compare the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of insular subregions in patients with MDD and BD in depressive episodes (BDD), who had never experienced manic or hypomanic episodes when they were scanned to identify biomarkers for the identification of two diseases. \n\n Methods:   We recruited 21 BDD patients, 40 MDD patients and 70 healthy controls (HC). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was performed. BDD patients had never had manic or hypomanic episodes when they were scanned, and the diagnoses were determined by follow-up. We divided the insula into three parts including the ventral anterior insular cortex (v-AIN), dorsal anterior insular cortex (d-AIN), and posterior insula (PI). The insular-based rsFC was compared among the three groups, and an analysis of the correlation between the rsFC value and Hamilton depression and anxiety scales was carried out. \n\n Results:   BDD and MDD patients demonstrated decreased rsFC from the v-AIN to the left superior/middle frontal gyrus compared with the HC group. Versus MDD and HC groups, BDD patients exhibited decreased rsFC from the v-AIN to the area in the left orbital frontal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus (included temporal pole), from the PI to the right lateral postcentral gyrus and from all three insular subregions to the somatosensory and motor cortex. Meanwhile, a correlation between the rsFC value of the PI-right lateral postcentral gyrus and anxiety score was observed in patients. \n\n Conclusion:   Our findings show BDD and MDD patients have similar decreases in insular connectivity in the dorsal lateral frontal regions, and BDD patients have specific decreased insular connectivity, especially in the somatosensory and motor cortex, which may be used as imaging evidence for clinical identification. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nBipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) belong to different diagnostic categories; however, it is very challenging to clinically identify BD and MDD with only the onset of depression. Although there are some clinical features that could help doctors identify BD early, such as family history ( ;  ;  ), atypical features ( ), age at onset ( ), comorbidity with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder ( ;  ;  ), this clinical information cannot be used to reliably and specifically predict the diagnosis. It is still not sufficient for clinicians to quickly diagnose BD with depression. Early research has shown that BD is often misdiagnosed, more than 1/3 of the patients with BD were first diagnosed with depression, and the correct diagnosis took a long time ( ). Several studies show that the average annual return rate of MDD diagnosis to BD was approximately 1\u20132% ( ;  ;  ). Among them, a 26-year follow-up study showed that the total diagnostic outcome was 39% ( ). Misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment for BD patients, delay the best time to treat, increase the incidence of mania ( ) and suicidal behavior, influence the prognosis of disease ( ;  ), and increase the economic burden ( ). Therefore, the early identification of BD with depression and MDD is essential. \n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising imaging method to study psychosis both in structure and function. Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) is a frequently used method which is indicated by the temporal correlations in spatially separated brain regions ( ). It may be clinically useful to the identification of BD and MDD in depressive episode ( ;  ). \n\nPrevious MRI studies indicate that BD and MDD show several disrupted brain regions, and the insula could be a key region associated with depression. A recent study on cortical structure from 20 cohorts worldwide, which contained more than two thousand MDD patients, suggest that adults with MDD had thinner cortical gray matter in the insula than controls ( ). Insular regional homogeneity is decreased in MDD and treatment-resistant depression ( ;  ). There is also increased insular amplitude of low frequency fluctuation in treatment-free MDD patients ( ). Cognitive task research displays that differential activation of the anterior/middle insula was significantly reduced in adolescents with MDD facing expressions of sadness and happiness compared to controls and correlated negatively with depression severity ( ). Meta-analyses and reviews also reported altered insular volumes in BD patient ( ;  ), and found the anterior insular volume was inversely correlated with the lifetime number of depressive episodes ( ). Depressive episodes of BD have been associated with increased serotonin transporter binding in the insula using positron emission tomography ( ). Studies also found the abnormal activation of the insular cortex in unmedicated BD patients and patients with bipolar depression ( ;  ). Reviews and meta-analyses for the first-degree relatives of BD patient report that the genetic liability for BD could be related to gray matter abnormalities in insular cortex ( ;  ). \n\nThe insula is a functionally and cytoarchitectonically diverse region of cortex located deep inside the lateral sulcus of the Sylvian fissure ( ). The insula connects to several cortical regions with different neural circuits and is involved in multiple functions, including emotion, cognition, sensory perception, and somatosensation ( ;  ,  ;  ). Based on the previous structural and functional studies, the insula is considered to have three different subregions, the ventral anterior insular cortex (v-AIN), dorsal anterior insular cortex (d-AIN), and posterior insula (PI) ( , ;  ;  ). The AIN affects emotional and cognitive function more, while the PI is more associated with motor-related functions and sensory perception ( ;  ;  ). Insular subregions exhibit different functional patterns to distinguish diseases. \n\nIn the current study, we used a seed-based fMRI method to examine the shared and distinct rsFC between participants with MDD and BD in depressive episodes (BDD). BDD patients had never had mania or hypomania episodes when they were scanned. Few studies have used insular subregion rsFC to study the difference between BDD and MDD, and the sample of BDD patients cannot exclude the effect of mania or hypomania on the brain. The v-AIN, d-AIN and PI were selected as the regions of interest (ROIs), and we explored rsFC between these seed regions to other brain regions. We hypothesized that both the MDD and BDD groups would demonstrate altered rsFC when compared to the control group; furthermore, we hypothesized that there would also be distinct changes in insular rsFC in MDD and BDD. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-one BDD patients, forty MDD patients and seventy healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. Participants ranged from 16 to 48 years old. HC participants were recruited via advertisements. Patients were recruited from two hospitals, the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University and the Shenyang Mental Health Center. At least two psychiatrists diagnosed the patients, respectively and came to the same diagnosis. All patients in this study met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria for MDD or BD but without other DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis. HC participants had no current or lifetime mental disorders and no history of mental disorder in first-degree relatives (determined by a psychiatrist). Symptoms were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Four sub-scores of the HAMD-17 scale were calculated based on the previous study ( ). The first factor was somatic anxiety saturated by somatic anxiety, hypochondriasis, general somatic symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms and scale items concerned with insomnia. The second factor was psychic anxiety defined by psychic anxiety, agitation, feelings of guilt and loss of insight. The third factor was a depressive dimension with high loadings on depressed mood, work and interests, and retardation. The fourth factor was anorexia included items such as weight loss and gastrointestinal symptoms. \n\nParticipants were excluded if they met any of the exclusion criteria as follows: (1) MRI contraindications; (2) any major medical diseases (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, liver and kidney diseases, blood diseases or metastatic disease); (3) any neurological disorder or head trauma with 5 min or more loss of consciousness; (4) any somatic diseases with psychotic symptoms (multiple sclerosis, typhoid, thyroid diseases); (5) any kinds of personality disorders; autism or developmental disorder; (6) obvious substance abuse/dependence within 3 months before recruitment; (7) pregnancy; or (8) IQ<70. \n\nFollow-up: All patients were followed up by telephone every three months after participation in the study. The forty MDD patients were followed up for more than 12 months without a change in diagnosis. The twenty-one BDD patients were in depressive episodes in the scan with the diagnosis of MDD. At the time of enrollment, we asked in detail whether there had been a history of manic or hypomanic episodes that met the DSM-IV criteria. During the follow-up period, if mania or hypomania is found, patients were suggested to see the psychiatrists again as soon as possible. When patients confirm that mania or hypomania is first appeared during the reassessment, they will be included in the BDD group of this study. \n\nAll participants were told of the content of the current study. Participants signed informed consent before the study process began. If the participant was underage, the guardian would sign the agreement. \n\n\n### Data Acquisition \n  \nMRI scans of all participants were carried out after recruitment using a GE (General Electric, Milwaukee, United States) Signa HDX 3.0T scanner with a standard 8-channel head coil. In the scanning process, the head of participant was fixed with a foam pad and the participants were kept in a state of rest: lying on their back, eyes closed (as much as possible to keep the eyeballs fixed) and trying not to think. Resting state fMRI scanning with a T2-gradient echo planar imaging (EPI-GRE) sequence: repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, field of view (FOV) = 240 mm  \u00d7 240 mm , matrix = 64 \u00d7 64, voxel size = 3.0 mm , 35 contiguous slices of 3 mm without gaps, scanning time 6 min 40 s with 200 volumetric images per participant. For the image calibration and participant screening, high-resolution images were scanned with a three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo (FSPGR) sequence. The parameters were as followed: TR/TE = 7.1/3.2 ms, FOV = 240 mm  \u00d7 240 mm , matrix = 240 \u00d7 240, voxel size = 1.0 mm , 176 contiguous slices of 1 mm without gaps, scanning time 8 min 22 s. \n\n\n### Data Processing and Analysis \n  \n#### fMRI Data Preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing of magnetic resonance imaging data and measurement calculations were managed by the DPABI ( ) package based on MATLAB 2011a using the following validated steps: converting the DICOM into the NIFTI format; removing the first 10 time points; slice timing; realignment; nuisance covariates, including the Friston 24 motion model, white matter signal, and cerebrospinal fluid signal, and global signals; spatial normalization to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and resampling into 3 mm  \u00d7 3 mm  \u00d7 3 mm  voxels; smoothing by a Gaussian filter of 6-mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM); and filtering low frequency signal by 0.01\u20130.08 Hz. All functional dates would be checked: if a head motion parameter more than 2.5 mm in displacement or 2.5\u00b0 in rotation, the subject was excluded from the final analysis. \n\n\n#### ROI Definition \n  \nThe insular subregions were subdivided based on a data-driven functional connectivity study ( ). Specifically, connectivity maps were computed for each voxel within the left and right insula from resting-state data. Then, the insula was parcellated based on connectivity maps using cluster analysis. Finally, three insular subregions with distinct connectivity patterns were identified, including ventral and dorsal anterior regions, and the posterior region. In this study, the three insular subregions were defined as the ROIs. \n\n\n#### Seed-Based rsFC Calculation \n  \nWe calculated the mean time courses of the voxels in the insular ROIs for each participant. A cerebral gray matter template including 90 labels of the Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) template was created. Pearson Correlation was performed between the insular ROIs and other cerebral gray matter regions at voxel level. The correlation coefficients were converted to   z  -values using the Fisher r-to-z transformation. \n\n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nDemographic and clinical data were analyzed using chi-squared test (for gender), independent sample   t  -test (for clinical scales) and non-parametric test (for age) with a significant threshold of   p   < 0.05. The statistical software was SPSS version 22.0. \n\nThe rsFC results of the three groups were analyzed by ANOVA using DPABI software. Monte Carlo simulation (AlphaSim) correction for multiple comparisons was carried out with the significant threshold set at   p   < 0.005 in a voxel-level and   p   < 0.05 in a cluster level. The rsFC values were extracted from the significant ANOVA results of all groups. Then, we performed   post hoc   comparisons between groups for significant regions with Bonferroni correction (Statistical significance was set at   p   < 0.05). \n\nThe correlation analyses between HAMD-17 and HAMA scores and rsFC values in the significant regions was performed. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and Clinical Data \n  \nStatistical results showed that the three groups were matched in gender. Age of HC and MDD groups did not conform to normal distribution. we made a non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis test) and found that there was no statistically significant difference in age among the three groups. HAMD-17 and HAMA scores of the patient groups were significantly different from the HC group, but there was no statistically significant difference between patient groups. The data of demographic and clinical scales are displayed in Table  . \n  \nDemographic and clinical data of participants. \n    \n\n### ANOVA Results for Three-Group Comparisons \n  \nAll significant results reported were corrected (Alphasim,   p   < 0.05) and results of head motion as a covariate showed in  . For the d-AIN connectivity, significant group differences were observed in the bilateral paracentral lobule, precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus; for the v-AIN connectivity, significant regions contained the left orbital frontal gyrus, left lateral frontal gyrus, left superior temporal regions, paracentral lobule, supplemental motor area, precuneus, precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus and middle cingulum; for the PI connectivity, one significant region was overlapped with d-AIN, the other region was the right postcentral gyrus. The results are showed in Figure   and Table  . \n  \nBrain regions showing significant differences in the three-group analysis. \n      \nClusters showing significant differences in the three-group analysis. Regions listed in Table  . The color bar represents the range of   F   values. The number represents coordinates for each slice. \n  \n\n###  Post hoc   Analysis \n  \nComparison between each pair of groups of the significant brain regions was carried out. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed by Bonferroni correction at the significant threshold of   p   < 0.05. Decreased rsFC between d-AIN/PI and paracentral lobule, precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus was observed in the BDD group compared with MDD and HC groups; for the v-AIN, the rsFC decreased areas overlapped but were more extensive and included the paracentral lobule, supplemental motor area, precuneus, precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and middle cingulum. Meanwhile, BDD group exhibited decreased rsFC between the PI and right lateral postcentral gyrus, and between the v-AIN and left superior frontal gyrus (SFG)/left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) versus MDD and HC. In addition, MDD and HC group indicated no significant difference in above rsFC. Decreased rsFC between v-AIN and the area of the left orbital frontal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus (including the temporal pole) was observed in both the BDD and MDD groups compared with HC group. BDD and MDD patients exhibited no statistical difference with Bonferroni correction   (p   = 0.056), but the BDD demonstrated a lower trend compared to MDD. These results are showed in Figure  . \n  \nComparison between groups for significant brain regions.   p   < 0.05 Bonferroni corrected.   (A)   d-AIN functional connectivity.

The regions listed in Table  . \n  \n\n### Correlation of Variables \n  \nFor the MDD group, a negative correlation was reported between the rsFC value of the PI-right postcentral gyrus and HAMA total score (  R   = -0.386,   P   = 0.042). For the BDD group, a positive correlation was observed between the rsFC value of the PI-right postcentral gyrus and the HAMD-17 sub-score of somatic anxiety (  R   = 0.458,   P   = 0.042). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we compared the insular subregions rsFC with whole brain among BDD, MDD, and HC. The choice of BDD patients greatly eliminated the influence of mania or hypomania on brain function. We found that significant changes mainly exist with the frontal and parietal lobes. The PI and d-AIN aberrant rsFC were observed mainly in the parietal lobe, but the v-AIN aberrant rsFC involved a wider range of regions included both the prefrontal lobe, parietal lobes and a small part of the temporal lobe. The common change of the BDD and MDD groups was the decreased rsFC of v-AIN with the left SFG and MFG. We did not find specific changes in the MDD group compared to the other two groups. For the BDD group, specific decreased rsFC included the primary somatosensory cortex with PI and d-AIN, right postcentral gyrus with PI, motor cortex with v-AIN and left orbital frontal gyrus and left superior temporal area with v-AIN. \n\nThe current study found a decreased rsFC of the left dorsolateral SFG and MFG with v-AIN in both BDD and MDD patients. These two aberrant regions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were consistent with previous studies. Previous studies reported that first-episode and medication-naive MDD patients had altered gray matter volume in SFG and MFG, which was negatively correlated with the duration of illness and the severity of clinical symptoms ( ;  ). Functional studies reported abnormal activation in the SFG, which was associated with rumination in MDD ( ;  ). Task-related and resting state functional studies reported the abnormal activation in the MFG ( ;  ), which was associated with anticipatory emotional processes and depressive symptoms such as apathy, anergia and loss of motivation in MDD ( ). Resting state functional studies also revealed abnormal regional homogeneity in the MFG on BD in depressive episodes ( ;  ). From these studies and our results, we considered that altered rsFC of DLPFC with v-AIN was the common pathophysiological basis of MDD and BDD. In addition, we found that there was a lower trend of decreased rsFC in BDD. One structural MRI study also found that depressed BD patients showed reduced thickness in the DLPFC compared to MDD ( ). We surmised that there was more serious dysfunction in BDD. \n\nBDD patients showed specific decreased v-AIN rsFC in left orbital frontal gyrus and left STG (included the left superior temporal pole), which were involved in fronto-limbic neural circuit. The orbital frontal cortex (OFC) participates in the process of learning, predicting and making emotional decisions, as well as the process of rewarding related behaviors ( ). Altered function in OFC might be associated with symptoms such as emotional instability and indecisiveness in BDD ( ). Studies have reported that OFC volume decreases in both adults and children with BD ( ;  ). Recent twin and family fMRI studies of BD also found that OFC rendered the most significant heritability estimates and was significantly correlated with the BD phenotype ( ). These studies indicate that OFC could play an important role in BD. Decreased OFC-insular connectivity was correlated with the processing of emotional information, which leaves the patients with the inability to properly treat their emotions, leading to increased negative self-focus ( ;  ). The superior temporal lobe participates in the processing of emotional experiences. Studies reported that the STG and the adjacent cerebral cortex play important roles in the processing of information related to individual communication ( ). Functional and DTI studies reported the abnormal degree centrality and mean diffusivity of the temporal pole in BD ( ;  ). Reduced rsFC between insula and the left STG related areas might result in social withdrawal and be related to the time and duration of the episode ( ). Together with these results, we considered that the decreased rsFC of vAIN-OFC and vAIN-superior temporal gyrus were specific in the pathophysiology of BDD. \n\nOther significant regions of BDD were in the motor cortex and included the primary somatosensory cortex and supplemental motor area (SMA), which had decreased rsFC with all three insular subregions. The primary somatosensory cortex mainly participates in the processing of sensory information and face emotion ( ). Previous studies found that abnormal overactivation by BD depressed patients in response to happy faces and fearful faces ( ). A study found increased rsFC between the somatosensory cortex and insular cortex in euthymic BD subjects compared to HC ( ). This was mutually verified by our results. The SMA participants in movement control and is involved in identifying and describing emotional feelings ( ). A study found different activation patterns of SMA in manic and depressed BD during reaction time tasks ( ). Overall, we speculated that the rsFC of the insula with the primary somatosensory cortex and SMA could be a mood state-related indicator in BD that increases in manic/hypomanic episodes and decreases in depression. The decreased rsFC could distinguish BDD from MDD. \n\nIn addition, we found that the rsFC between PI and the right lateral postcentral gyrus was correlated with anxiety in patients. However, the correlation patterns were different. Depression often has anxiety symptoms. The mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we considered that the insula regulates part of the somatosensory cortex and plays an important role. Further research is needed in the future. \n\nThe present study has several limitations. First, the sample size of BDD patients was small because the BDD patients were drawn from the initial group of MDD patients after follow-up. Second, we are not sure whether the drug will affect the results. Finally, we did not conduct cognitive tests and we did not carry out classified studies to further verify our results. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nBDD and MDD patients showed similar and distinct decreased insular rsFC changes. BDD patients have specific decreased insular connectivity, especially in the somatosensory and motor cortex, which may be used as imaging evidence for clinical identification. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nAll proceduresperformed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

In addition, compared with patients without RD, patients with RD showed decreased FC between left OP2 and regions of left MFG, AG, middle temporal gyrus, and right CPL. Moreover, in patients with RD, the FC between left thalamus and OP2 was negatively correlated with duration of RD, and the FC between left AG and OP2 was negatively correlated with duration of BPPV. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nBPPV patients with RD showed reduced FC between brain regions involved in vestibular processing and spatial cognition; These results suggested that BPPV patients with RD might have diminished central processing of vestibular information and impaired spatial cognition. \n\n  \nBPPV patients with RD showed reduced FC between brain regions involved in vestibular processing and spatial cognition; These results suggested that BPPV patients with RD might have diminished central processing of vestibular information and impaired spatial cognition.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common peripheral vertigo disease.  Epidemiology showed that the lifetime prevalence of BPPV was 2.4%, the annual prevalence was 1.6%, and the annual incidence was 0.6%.  Canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) is the most important treatment for BPPV, which removes the otolith from the affected semicircular canal and gets rid of vertigo instantly upon most occasions.  However, 31% to 61% of BPPV patients still suffer from residual dizziness (RD) lasting a few weeks to several months after successful CRP. These BPPV patients with RD usually complain of a non\u2010specific dizziness, imbalance, or unsteadiness, without positional vertigo and nystagmus. ,  \n\nCurrently, the potential neural mechanism of RD remains unclear. Some studies considered that the occurrence of RD was attributed to incomplete central nervous system adaptation and compensatory. ,   A recent resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study suggested that patients with BPPV exhibited increased fractional amplitude of low\u2010frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in region of pons, functional changes in pons might reflect central adaptation and compensatory after repeated attacks of episodic vertigo.  Previous studies have also shown that the vestibular nucleus of the pons might play an important role in central compensation in patients with unilateral external vestibular damage or in rats model of acute unilateral labyrinthotomy. ,   In central vestibular pathway, it was confirmed that the vestibular nucleus relies on vestibular information to the vestibular cortex through the thalamus.  It was reported that the parieto\u2010insular vestibular cortex (PIVC) was the core of the human vestibular cortex, and parietal operculum cortex 2 (OP2) was the core of PIVC and was considered to be the primary vestibular cortical region in humans. ,   Thus, it is reasonable to think that the vestibular nucleus relies on vestibular information to the OP2 through the thalamus, and the functional changes in pons (vestibular nucleus) in patients with BPPV may indicate abnormal functional activity of the OP2. However, it is currently not clear whether BPPV patients with RD showed abnormal functional activity of the OP2. \n\nTherefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the alterations in resting\u2010state functional connectivity (FC) focused on the bilateral OP2 and to determine whether these changes in FC correlate with certain clinical features in BPPV patients with RD after successful CRP. We hypothesize that the neural mechanism of RD involves functional changes in brain pathways through the OP2, and the altered FC of OP2 may potentially become an imaging biomarker for the diagnosis of RD in patients with BPPV. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nBetween March 2020 and June 2023, 165 right\u2010handed subjects were recruited at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, including 55 BPPV patients with RD, 55 BPPV patients without RD, and 55 healthy volunteers. The BPPV patients were diagnosed using the criterion established by B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Society in 2015.  Prior to enrollment, all patients underwent routine neuro\u2010otological interrogations and examinations to exclude secondary BPPV resulting from vestibular neuritis (VN), Meniere's disease (MD), vestibular migraine (VM), or head trauma. Patients with central nervous system disorders, psychiatric, or systemic disorders were excluded. BPPV with superior semicircular canal (SSC) or multi\u2010canal (MC) are rare. It was reported that SSC\u2010BPPV accounts for 1% to 3% of cases and the MC\u2010BPPV accounted for no more than 5% of patients with BPPV. ,   In addition, according to a recent systematic review and meta\u2010analysis, the affected side, location, or type of semicircular canal involvement have no concern with the occurrence of RD.  Therefore, we only included BPPV patients with unilateral posterior semicircular canal (PSC) or horizontal semicircular canal (HSC); patients with MC or SSC were excluded. \n\nOnce diagnosed, patients with PSC\u2010BPPV were treated with Epley's maneuver  or Semont maneuver ,   and patients with HSC\u2010BPPV were treated by Barbecue rotation maneuver (geotropic lateral canal BPPV)  or Gufoni maneuver (apogeotropic lateral canal BPPV). ,   A Dix\u2013Hallpike or supine\u2010roll test was performed 1\u2009h after CRP to ensure a successful treatment. ,   After a successful CRP, the following demographic and clinical data were collected, including age, sex, educational years, affected side, involved semicircular canal, and duration of BPPV before successful CRP. In addition, scores of dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) and vertigo visual analog scale (VVAS) before successful CRM were collected. Then, all patients experienced 1\u2009week follow\u2010up evaluation through interviews. During the interviews, the identification of RD symptoms was performed. Scores of DHI and dizziness VAS (DVAS) for patients with RD after successful CRP were recorded. All patients with and without RD underwent resting\u2010state fMRI scanning. In addition, the duration of RD symptoms for each patient with RD was collected. As symptoms of BPPV or RD may lead to anxiety and depression, some patients may even transition to persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD, a chronic functional vestibular disorder which is characterized by persistent non\u2010rotational dizziness and instability combined with anxiety and depression lasting more than 3\u2009months).  All patients were assessed by Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) during the follow\u2010up; patients with scores of HAMA\u2009>\u200914 or HAMD\u2009>\u200917 were excluded. Patients with RD symptoms lasting more than 3\u2009months were excluded. \n\nFifty\u2010five age\u2010, gender\u2010 and education\u2010matched volunteers were recruited. They had no history of vertigo, nor did they have a history of drug or alcohol abuse. Volunteers with neurological, mental, or systemic disorders were excluded. They received resting\u2010state fMRI scanning and demographic information was gathered. To rule out the effects of cognitive impairment on the brain function of the subjects, all subjects were evaluated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); participants with scores of MoCA\u2009<\u200926 were excluded. Assessments of MoCA, HAMA, and HAMD were conducted by a qualified neuropsychologist who was blinded to the outcome data. Our study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University (\u30102020\u3011021801) and all subjects provided written informed consent forms before entering the study. \n\n\n### Imaging acquisition \n  \nAll Participants received high\u2010resolution three\u2010dimensional T1\u2010weighted (3D\u2010T1) anatomical imaging and resting\u2010state fMRI using a 3.0T GE MRI scanner (GE Medical Systems) at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University. Subjects were required to rest with their eyes closed and lie still during the scanning. The 3D\u2010T1 images were acquired with 1\u2009mm isotropic voxels using a BRAVO sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092500\u2009ms, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009ms, flip angle (FA)\u2009=\u20098\u00b0, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, 156 slices. We adopted a fast\u2010field echo\u2010planar imaging (EPI) sequence to acquire the whole brain fMRI images (TR\u2009=\u20092000\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms, FA\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009200\u2009\u00d7\u2009200\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, thickness\u2009=\u20093.6\u2009mm, gap\u2009=\u20090\u2009mm, 210 volumes, total scan time\u2009=\u20097\u2009min). \n\n\n### Image data preprocessing \n  \nTo reduce the influence of initial unstable blood\u2010oxygenation\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) signal, the first 10 functional time points were removed; the left 200 time points were preprocessed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 software (SPM12,  ) and CONN toolbox (Whitfeld\u2010Gabrieli S, 2012; Version 18b;  ) working on MATLAB R2016a (MathWorks, Inc.). The preprocessing steps were the default parameters within the CONN toolbox, including (a) functional slice\u2010timing correction, (b) functional realignment, (c) functional outlier detection (a subject head motion threshold set at 3\u2009mm and a global signal threshold set at z\u2009=\u20099), (d) structural center to (0, 0, 0) coordinates (translation), (e) functional segmentation and normalization (DARTEL), and (f) spatial smoothing based on a Gaussian kernel of 6\u2010mm full\u2010width at half maximum. Four patients in RD group, five patients in non\u2010RD group, and two healthy subjects were excluded due to large head motion or poor normalization. Totally, 51 patients with RD, 50 patients without RD, and 53 healthy subjects were included in the following analysis. \n\n\n### Seed\u2010based functional connectivity \n  \nAfter preprocessing, filtering (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) was adopted to eliminate the influences of low\u2010frequency drift and high\u2010frequency noise. Cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and global mean signals, as well as the 24 motion realignment parameters were regressed out. We performed a seed\u2010to\u2010voxel method using two seeds (the bilateral OP2) related to key vestibular cortex of the brain. We extracted the two seeds from the Juelich histological atlas available on the FMRIB Software Library ( ). Then, the mean time\u2010courses of the two seeds were extracted and the Pearson's correlation coefficients (  r  ) between the extracted time\u2010courses and all other time\u2010courses of the entire brain voxels were calculated. Finally,   r   was converted to z scores using Fisher's r\u2010to\u2010z transformation. It is now still complex and controversial whether to remove the global mean signal. Therefore, we also performed an analysis without using global signal regression (GSR) and the results are demonstrated in Tables\u00a0  and   and Figures\u00a0 \u2013 . \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \n#### Analysis of demography and clinical characteristics \n  \nStatistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, v22.0) for Windows (SPSS Institute Inc.). All data of continuous variables were tested for normality. Group comparisons of demographic information among the three groups were performed using chi\u2010square tests for categorical variables (gender) and one\u2010way analysis of covariance (ANOVA) for parametric continuous variables (age, years of education, scores of MoCA, HAMA, and HAMD). For BPPV patients with and without RD, the two\u2010sample   t  \u2010tests were used for parametric continuous variables (scores of VVAS and DHI, and duration of vertigo before successful CRM) and chi\u2010square tests were used for categorical variables (affected side and affected semicircular canal). \n\n\n#### Analysis of differences in FC \n  \nGroup differences in FC among the three groups were tested using a voxel\u2010wise one\u2010way ANOVA, with age, gender, years of education, scores of MoCA, HAMA, and HAMD as covariates. To show the inter\u2010group differences, we performed post\u2010hoc two\u2010sample   t  \u2010tests between every two of the three groups, controlling for demographic and clinical features severally. The post\u2010hoc inter\u2010group comparisons were performed within the mask which showed FC differences from the ANOVA analysis. Multiple comparisons were corrected by a false discovery rate (FDR) method (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). \n\n\n#### Correlation analysis \n  \nFor FC showing significant between\u2010group differences, we performed Pearson's partial correlation analysis between altered FC and clinical characteristics (duration of vertigo, scores of VVAS and DHI before successful CRM, and duration of RD, scores of DVAS and DHI after successful CRM) in BPPV patients with RD, controlling for age, gender, educational years, MoCA, HAMA, HAMD, affected side, and affected semicircular canal. The significance level was set at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Demographic and clinical characteristics \n  \nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the three groups were summarized in Table\u00a0 . As we could see, there was no statistical difference among the three groups in age, gender, education level, scores of MoCA, HAMA, and HAMD (all   p\u2009>  \u20090.05). In addition, no significant difference was observed between BPPV patients with and without RD in affected side, affected semicircular canal, and VVAS scores before successful CRP (all   p  \u2009>\u20090.05). However, BPPV patients with RD showed longer duration of BPPV (  p  \u2009=\u20090.002) and higher DHI scores (  p  \u2009=\u20090.005) before successful CRP in comparison with BPPV patients without RD. \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects. \n    \n\n###  FC   differences across groups \n  \nWhen the left OP2 was selected as a seed, the three groups showed significant FC differences in the left angular gyrus (AG), left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), parahippocampa gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus (MTG), as well as the bilateral thalamus, precuneus, and cerebellar regions (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FDR corrected; Figure\u00a0 ). When the right OP2 was chosen as a seed, one\u2010way ANOVA revealed no obvious difference among the three groups in FC. The post\u2010hoc results demonstrated that BPPV patients with RD exhibited decreased FC between the left OP2 and regions of the left AG, thalamus, precuneus, MFG, and the right cerebellum posterior lobe (CPL) in comparison with healthy subjects (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FDR corrected; Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ); Beyond that, compared with BPPV patients without RD, patients with RD showed decreased FC between the left OP2 and regions of the left MFG, AG, MTG, and the right CPL (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FDR corrected; Figure\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nBrain regions showing significant FC differences among the three groups when the left OP2 was selected as a seed (one\u2010way ANOVA,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (FDR corrected)).

The difference in results without GSR was that the left OP2 showed decreased FC with left fusiform gyrus in BPPV patients with RD compared with healthy controls, and the left OP2 displayed decreased FC with right superior parietal lobule and left inferior parietal lobule in BPPV patients with RD compared with patients without RD (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FDR corrected; Tables\u00a0  and   and Figures\u00a0  and  ). \n\n\n### Associations between   FC   and clinical characteristics in   BPPV   patients with   RD  \n  \nAs shown in Figure\u00a0 , in BPPV patients with RD, the FC (z\u2010value) between left thalamus and OP2 was negatively correlated with the duration of RD symptoms (  p  \u2009=\u20090.025,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.313), and the FC (  z  \u2010value) between left AG and OP2 was negatively correlated with the duration of BPPV (  p  \u2009=\u20090.011,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.352). \n  \n(A) Functional connectivity (FC) between the left thalamus and the left parietal operculum cortex 2 (OP2) was negatively correlated with the duration of residual dizziness (RD) (  p  \u2009=\u20090.025,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.313); (B) FC between the left angular gyrus (AG) and the left OP2 was negatively correlated with the duration of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in patients with RD (  p  \u2009=\u20090.011,   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.352). \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThis study is the first one which investigated resting\u2010state FC changes focusing on OP2 in BPPV patients with RD after successful treatment. The results showed altered FC between the left OP2 and regions of the left AG, MFG, thalamus, precuneus, MTG, and the right CPL in BPPV patients with RD compared to BPPV patients without RD and healthy volunteers. \n\nCompared with patients without RD and healthy subjects, patients with RD exhibited decreased FC between left OP2 and left AG. The AG is located in a posterior part of the inferior parietal lobule corresponding to Brodmann Area (BA) 39.  A functional neuroimaging study suggested that the bilateral AG were significantly activated during task of spatial navigation.  It was also reported that there existed structural plasticity in the AG when subjects were learning new skills that tap on spatial coordination.  Thus, it is believed that the AG is involved in spatial cognition, which reflects our ability to process and integrate all spatial aspects of our environment, including the spatial analysis of external sensory information and internal mental representations.  The functional changes in the left AG have been previously observed in patients with chronic unilateral vestibulopathy during rest and in patients with PPPD during stationary emotional stimulation. ,   Our study found altered function in AG in BPPV patients with RD, which was consistent with a previous resting\u2010state fMRI study which reported decreased ALFF in the AG in BPPV patients with RD compared to patients without RD.  We also found that the FC between left AG and OP2 was negatively correlated with the duration of BPPV. Our results indicated impaired spatial cognition in BPPV patients with RD, and the occurrence of RD might be related to the reduced FC between the areas involved in central vestibular processing and spatial cognition. \n\nWe also found decreased FC between the left OP2 and right CPL/Crus2 in BPPV patients with RD compared to patients without RD and healthy controls. Central vestibular pathway involves the cerebellum, as the projections from the vestibular nuclei extend to the cerebellum.  The cerebellum is an important area playing a vital role in maintaining balance and coordination of the goal\u2010oriented movements.  The cerebellum is closely associated with dizziness and vertigo; stroke with lesions within the cerebellum is one of the most common causes of vascular vertigo.  As part of the cerebellum, the CPL/Crus2 was reported to be closely related to spatial cognition, playing an important role in spatial navigation and orientation. ,   The altered function in CPL/Crus2 found in our study was in keeping with the abnormal gray matter volume (GMV) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) in CPL/Crus2 in patients with BPPV in a previous neuroimaging study.  Thus, we suspected that the decreased FC between left OP2 and right CPL/Crus2 might also indicate reduced connectivity between the regions engaged in vestibular processing and spatial cognition. \n\nThe MFG was previously thought to be involved in vestibular processing and was reported to be a part of vestibular network, as it was obviously activated during tasks of vestibular or caloric stimulation. ,   The MFG receives vestibular information from vestibular nuclei and is believed to be the origin of direct white matter fibers to the vestibular nuclei.  Functional changes in MFG have been reported in previous vestibular disorders, including VM, PPPD, visually induced dizziness (VID), and mal de debarquement syndrome. ,  ,  ,  ,   In BPPV patients with RD, we found decreased FC between left OP2 and left MFG when comparing to BPPV patients without RD and healthy controls. The decreased FC between OP2 and MFG in our study might suggest decreased connectivity within the central vestibular network. \n\nBased on previous neuroimaging studies and lesion studies, the thalamus plays an important role in central vestibular processing as well, it receives vestibular input from the vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum, and conveys vestibular information to the central vestibular cortex. ,  ,  ,   In this study, we found decreased FC between left OP2 and left thalamus in BPPV patients with RD, indicating decreased thalamo\u2010OP2 vestibular pathway. In addition, we observed that the FC between left thalamus and OP2 was negatively correlated with duration of RD. As all fMRI data were collected at the early stage of RD symptoms (within 1\u2009week), we believed that the decreased FC between left thalamus and OP2 potentially predict the development and the duration of residual dizziness in patients with BPPV. \n\nThe precuneus is a core region of default mode network (DMN) and plays a crucial role in attention monitoring and self\u2010centered cognition.  It was demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the precuneus evoked symptom of vertigo, suggesting that the precuneus was an important brain region in processing vestibular information. ,   In the present study, we observed decreased FC between left OP2 and left precuneus in BPPV patients with RD compared to healthy controls; this result was in agreement with a previous resting\u2010state fMRI study which reported decreased ALFF in the bilateral precuneus in BPPV patients with RD.  Our results of decreased FC between left OP2 and left precuneus in BPPV patients with RD might indicate decreased connectivity within the vestibular network. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nThis study has certain limitations in some aspects. First, the sample size of the present study was relatively small and only resting\u2010state fMRI was adopted, a multi\u2010model MRI study with larger sample size should be considered in the following study. Second, we only adopted a seed\u2010based FC method, which could not overcome the defect of forcibly segmenting the brain atlas. Subsequent studies should combine seed\u2010based FC with other methods, for example, independent component analysis (ICA)\u2010based FC or functional network connectivity (FNC), dynamic FC or FNC, graph theory analysis, etc. Last but not the least, the results of seeds\u2010based FC with and without global signal regression was not entirely consistent. This might have some influence on the conclusion of this study. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nIn summary, the current study found that BPPV patients with RD showed reduced FC between brain regions involved in vestibular processing and spatial cognition. These results suggested that BPPV patients with RD might have diminished central processing of vestibular information and impaired spatial cognition. In addition, the reduced FC could potentially become an imaging biomarker for the early diagnosis of RD in patients with BPPV, which should be further verified by machine learning (ML) methods with more subjects in the future. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nZhengwei Chen and Yueji Liu designed the study, analyzed the data, and wrote the main manuscript; Cunxin Lin, Dan Liu, and Lijie Xiao collected the data; Haiyan Liu and Xiu\u2010e Wei organized the data; Liangqun Rong revised the manuscript.

Experimental tasks have typically studied free choice by contrasting free and instructed selection of response alternatives. These tasks have been criticised, and it remains unclear how they relate to the subjective feeling of freely choosing. We replicated previous findings of the fMRI correlates of free choice, defined objectively. We introduced a novel task in which participants could experience and report a graded sense of free choice. BOLD responses for conditions subjectively experienced as free identified a postcentral area distinct from the areas typically considered to be involved in free action. Thus, the brain correlates of subjective feeling of free action were not directly related to any established brain correlates of objectively-defined free action. Our results call into question traditional assumptions about the relation between subjective experience of choosing and activity in the brain\u2019s so-called voluntary motor areas. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDebates over whether humans have the capacity to make free choices have been ongoing for several centuries ( ). In contrast, there is wider consensus about the existence of a   subjective experience   of acting freely ( ). We often have the impression that our internal conscious decisions drive our behaviour. In other words, we feel that our decisions and actions are not simple determined by the immediate environment, but rather expressions of our \u201cagentic self\u201d ( ). \n\nAccording to one view, these subjective experiences are illusory ( ), and the \u201cconscious will\u201d is merely a retrospective inference, rather than a direct readout of brain activity associated with action selection or action generation. The experimental studies supporting this view largely used behavioural methods to identify \u201cillusions of will\u201d ( ), and to manipulate their intensity ( ). Further support for this view comes from electrophysiological and neurophysiological recordings ( ). These studies show that the onset of the neural events associated with free decisions precede the reported onset of the awareness of intention, and suggest that conscious intention cannot be a causal factor for free decisions. Interestingly, however, few studies have investigated where in the brain this alleged illusion arises. \n\nNeuroscientific studies have often defined volition by drawing a distinction between the information-processing underlying free and instructed actions. Because this definition makes no appeal to subjective experience, it has proved particularly useful in studies with animals ( ). In this operationalization, instructed actions are fixed, yet possibly arbitrary, associations of stimuli with movements. Typically in instructed actions, both the timing and type of action are explicitly specified (the   when   and   what   of action ( )). In contrast, free actions leave either the \u201cwhat\u201d or the \u201cwhen\u201d dimension of action underspecified (\u201cwhen\u201d ( ), \u201cwhat\u201d ( )). Thus, free actions are those which do not entirely depend on explicit external signals, but depend more strongly on hypothesised internal sources. However, specifying precisely what these internal sources actually are has proved difficult and controversial ( ). They may include action goals ( ), or memories ( ). As such, free actions cannot, by definition, be strongly related to any   single   environmental event, although they may be weakly related to a wide range of environmental inputs ( ). \n\nSupport for the free vs. instructed account of volition comes partly from primate neuroanatomical evidence ( ). Lateral portions of the premotor cortices are responsible for instructed or reactive actions driven by explicit external signals, while medial premotor areas, notably the supplementary motor area (SMA), are responsible for free, self-generated or \u201cprojectional\u201d action. For example,   showed that removal of the medial premotor cortex in monkeys impaired their ability to make learnt arbitrary arm movements at their own pace, in order to receive a food reward. The same monkeys showed less impairment to make the same movement following an external auditory cue. \n\nThis account of free choice has been supported by several human neuroimaging studies. The contrast between free and instructed movement choices has been consistently associated with increased BOLD signal in the SMA and preSMA, the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) ( ), (see   for a review). In particular,   have suggested that RCZ is mainly involved in selecting the \u201cwhat\u201d component, in the context of a given task ( ); whilst preSMA participates in selecting the \u201cwhen\u201d component of actions. In addition,   have recently shown that the BOLD activations generally associated with free choice need not be associated with overt movement. Covert unrestricted choices between objects also elicited comparable BOLD activations to free selection of motor responses, centred on the medial frontal cortex regions. \n\nThis tradition has therefore capitalised on objective experimental design factors which allow instructed and free choice to be defined in terms of information that is provided by external cues, or is not so provided. This definition bypasses the subjective experience of free choice. However, understanding the neural basis of the common feeling of acting freely is important. On the one hand, if free choice is indeed illusory, understanding the mechanism underlying illusions has long been a productive approach in psychological research. On the other hand, if free choice is not illusory then the neural bases of the subjective experience of free choice may be relevant to understanding how and where free choices occur in the brain. \n\nThe scientific tradition reviewed above operationalizes voluntary action based on objective criteria. This tradition implicitly assumes that voluntary action operationalized in this objective way captures the subjective feeling of acting intentionally. However, this important implicit assumption has never been appropriately validated. If the assumption is correct, and there is a correspondence between objective and subjective accounts of free action, then the neural correlates of free and instructed choices defined objectively should roughly match with those defined subjectively. We therefore devised an experimental task in which actions were defined either on the basis of an objective definition, or on the basis of subjective experience. We then investigated the brain correlates associated with free choices under each of the two possible definitions. \n\nHere we use and extend the classic distinction between instructed and free choice to investigate the neural correlates of   subjective   voluntariness. Importantly, we also consider that external guidance can come in varying degrees; so that the instructed/free distinction is not a simple dichotomy between two exclusive categories, but rather represents two extremes of a continuum. On this view, generating an action can involve both internal and external factors. For example, when a driver brakes or accelerates in response to a traffic signal, they are responding both to the external event of the signal\u2019s colour, but their action also depends on an arbitrary rule that they have acquired, and chosen to follow. For our purposes, we consider freedom of choice as a   graded   measure of how independent an action is from an external stimulus. When an action is strongly determined by an external stimulus, it will be \u201cless free\u201d than when it is not. We may then ask whether people subjectively experience degrees of voluntariness underlying individual action decisions, and whether this graded experience originates from graded levels of activation in particular brain areas. \n\nWe have adapted the classic task of random number generation ( ) to allow both an objective, graded continuum of integration of stimulus information, and also a graded continuum of subjective experience of voluntariness regarding action choice. Random number generation tasks have been used before in relation to volition, but for rather different reasons from ours. In particular, many free selection studies involve asking participants to produce balanced numbers of responses, while avoiding obvious patterns such as alternation. These tasks have been interpreted as covertly asking participants to generate apparently random response sequences ( ). For example, human positron emission tomography (PET) studies during random number generation tasks have suggested a critical involvement of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the anterior cingulate cortex, the bilateral superior parietal cortex, and the right inferior frontal cortex ( ). These areas partially overlap with those identified with free selection tasks ( ). In our case, a modified random generation task offered a convenient vehicle to allow participants to experience and report a graded sense of stimulus-independence or freedom of action. \n\nCrucially, in two separate analyses, we compared extreme situations of free and instructed action as operationalized by the classical objective paradigms, and also situations in which actions subjectively   felt   more free or   felt   more constrained, based on self-report. In this way, we hoped to establish the relationship between free actions as traditionally defined, and the subjective experience of having chosen freely. \n\nIn the crucial condition for studying graded voluntariness, we presented a number sequence and asked participants to complete the sequence with a number that would make the sequence \u201clook random\u201d. The method that participants used to achieve this presumably varied from person to person, depending on their subjective concept of a random sequence. However, the actual interpretation of \u201crandom appearance\u201d was not our central interest here. In contrast we focussed on participants\u2019 subjective feeling of voluntariness associated with whatever choices they had in fact made. Subjective, quantitative report of voluntariness allows us to study the feeling of free choice with high ecological validity. Thus, instructed actions allow for no flexibility of behaviour, whereas free actions, in the everyday sense, may be the result of an internal evaluation of the applicability and relative importance of the several different internal rules. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-three healthy participants took part in the study (5 female; mean age 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0years). All participants gave written informed consent. Procedures were approved by the local ethical committee, and were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. No participant had a history of neurological, major medical, or psychiatric disorder. \n\n\n### Stimuli and procedure \n  \nEach participant made manual actions to choose numbers on a screen using a trackball in experimental trials within three different contexts in a random number generation task. \n\nEach trial proceeded as follows (see  ). A white fixation cross was displayed on a black background. The fixation duration was sampled from a pseudologarithmic distribution, and ranged from 2 to 14\u00a0s. The fixation cross served as a variable period constituting an implicit baseline BOLD measure. Immediately after, either a sequence of four numbers (from 1 to 4) or four X\u2019s appeared on the screen, above a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 response grid. The position of each number in the grid was randomly assigned and changed in every trial. Participants held an MRI-compatible trackball on their lap. The mouse cursor was displayed on the screen using a red \u201c+\u201d sign, initially positioned on the centre of the response grid. Participants were instructed to select a number from the response grid by moving the mouse cursor to the chosen number and clicking on it. The choice of number was based in the number stem presented (see below). Once the number was selected, it was displayed next to the stem for 0.8\u00a0s. \n\nIn two of the contexts the question \u201cHow free was your choice?\u201d (\u201cHoe VRIJ voelde je keuze aan?\u201d in Dutch) was displayed above a visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS had 10 subdivisions, and its extremes were labelled \u201cVery free\u201d and \u201cNot free\u201d (\u201cHEEL vrij\u201d and \u201cNIET vrij\u201d). The left\u2013right orientation of the VAS labels was counterbalanced across participants, but kept constant for each participant throughout the whole practice and experimental sessions, to avoid confusion. Participants were asked to indicate how free they felt their choice had been by clicking with the cursor on the appropriate position. Participants were reminded that they could use the whole range of the VAS. \n\nThe maximum response time for the number selection and the voluntariness rating was 5\u00a0s. If participants had given no response after this time had elapsed, a message appeared and the next trial started. \n\nFirst, we compared conditions of free choice versus instructed choice in a   classical   context (see below), operationally defined in the same way as the classical literature on free/instructed choices. Second, in an   objective   context, participants performed the free and instructed conditions again, but each trial was followed by a rating of how free they felt their immediately-preceding action choice had been. Finally, in the crucial   subjective context  , participants chose which of several actions to make following presentation of a suggestive stimulus, and rated on a continuous scale the extent to which their action choice had been free or not free, with respect to the information given in the suggestive stimulus. \n\nThe subjective context necessarily involved a subjective rating, whilst the classical context did not, making it difficult to compare these conditions directly. The objective context was designed to get round this problem, by providing a condition which was informationally equivalent to the classical context, but also included the element of introspective report. In this way, BOLD activity associated with the objective context could be contrasted with activity in the subjective context because both contexts included both an action selection and a judgement event in each trial. \n\n#### Classical context \n  \nWith the classical context, we aimed at identifying patterns of BOLD signal associated with actions that have been classically treated as free. In free trials, the presented sequence was always \u201cX X X X\u201d. In these trials, participants were free to choose any of the four numbers (1, 2, 3 or 4) displayed on screen as their action. In instructed trials, the sequence contained one single number repeated four times (e.g., \u201c1 1 1 1\u201d). In these trials, participants were instructed to choose the number that was displayed on the screen (i.e., 1). \n\nThe   classical   context was effectively used as a localizer, to define regions of interest (ROIs). The BOLD activity for the other two contexts was analysed for ROIs identified independently from the data from the classical context. \n\n\n#### Objective context \n  \nOur main aim was to compare the brain correlates of the extreme free and instructed conditions with those of a subjective context in which participants could themselves report how free their choice had been by means of a VAS (see below). In order to make the two contexts comparable, we included a VAS rating in the objective context. In this way, any BOLD activity differences between the objective and the subjective contexts could not be attributed to the mere presence of the VAS. \n\n\n#### Subjective context \n  \nWith the subjective context, we aimed at providing participants with a scenario in which they could experience a graded sense of more or less free choice. Unlike in the other two contexts, the numerical stimulus presented in each trial contained a pseudorandomized sequence of numbers. Participants were instructed to use this sequence as a suggestive guide for their response. They were asked to choose a number that would make the stimulus sequence \u201clook random\u201d. We assumed that folk knowledge would guide participants in their choices ( ). Each participant might have felt highly constrained by some preceding sequences, and very unconstrained by other sequences. Participants were asked to report choices as being less and more free in those trials respectively. The beliefs and strategies would differ from person to person, and were not relevant for our purposes. Instead, we used random sequence generation as a means to provide participants with a graded and reportable experience of voluntariness, in the sense of freedom from constraint. We could then use this to investigate the brain activity associated with the experience of voluntariness. \n\nThe numerical stimulus therefore served to prompt the next action choice to some extent. The extent to which it did so was assumed to influence the experience of subjective freedom of choice. Any of a number of rules could relate the numerical stimulus to the chosen action. We chose to ask them to make the stimulus \u201clook random\u201d, and to report their subjective feeling of freedom of choice. The precise   form   of the completion rule used may have varied across participants and was irrelevant to our purposes. Instead, we were interested in the   extent   of constraint provided by the numerical stimulus and the rule, which participants were asked to report. We assumed that subjective reports of freedom of choice were informative of this relative constraint. In this way, voluntariness was not directly manipulated experimentally. Instead, introspection was taken as a reliable method to report subjective experience. \n\nIt is important to emphasise that, unlike previous studies (e.g.,  ) here we did not   assume   that the subjective feelings of voluntariness would directly correlate with the number of available alternatives. Instead, we gave participants a complex rule and allowed them to interpret it. In that way, we hoped to distil the bases of the feelings of voluntariness,   independently   from any preconceptions from the experimenter\u2019s part. \n\nThe sequences for the subjective context were generated by a pseudorandomized procedure. We defined a measure of \u201cstimulus space\u201d for each sequence as the number of different numbers present in the stem (irrespective of position). The sequences \u201c3 3 3 3\u201d; \u201c2 2 1 2\u201d; \u201c3 1 4 4\u201d and \u201c2 3 4 1\u201d are examples of sequences with stimulus spaces of 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. We distributed the total 160 subjective trials into 4 blocks of 40 trials. Pilot results suggested that participants\u2019 ratings of subjective freedom of choice were related to the size of stimulus space. Therefore, each block contained sequences with equal numbers with all possible stimulus spaces. The sequences for the subjective context were the same for all participants, to allow for potential comparisons across participants. Their order of appearance was randomized across blocks and trials. \n\nAdditionally in the subjective context, a memory question was displayed every 10 trials. A four-number sequence was presented and participants were asked if that sequence had been presented in the preceding 10 trials, with a maximum response time of 5\u00a0s. This memory question was aimed at encouraging participants to pay attention to the number stimuli presented on every trial, and the responses were not analysed. \n\nEach participant performed two consecutive blocks of 40 trials in each of the classical and objective contexts. They also performed 4 consecutive blocks of 40 trials in the subjective context, which formed the key focus of the study. The order of the contexts was randomized across participants. \n\nBefore scanning, participants were trained with at least one practice block for each context, always in the same order: classical; objective, subjective. Training continued until participants felt comfortable with the task. The experiment in the scanner lasted approximately 70\u00a0min. \n\nAfter scanning, participants completed five personality questionnaires addressing feelings of control ( ) belief in free will (the free will and determinism scale ( ); the social desirability scale ( ); and two self-control questionnaires ( )). In addition participants completed a semi-structured questionnaire about the strategies they had adopted in the completion of the random number sequences. \n\n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nParticipants were positioned head first and supine in the magnet bore. Images were collected with a 3T Trio MRI scanner system (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany), using an 8-channel radiofrequency head coil. First, 176 high-resolution anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE sequence [TR\u00a0=\u00a02500\u00a0ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a02.58\u00a0ms, image matrix\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256, FOV\u00a0=\u00a0220\u00a0mm, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a07\u00b0, slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a00.90\u00a0mm, voxel size\u00a0=\u00a00.9\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.86\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.86\u00a0mm (resized to 1\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm)]. Whole brain functional images were collected using a T2 -weighted EPI sequence, sensitive to BOLD contrast (TR\u00a0=\u00a02000\u00a0ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a035\u00a0ms, image matrix\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064, FOV\u00a0=\u00a0224\u00a0mm, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a080\u00b0, slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a03.0\u00a0mm, distance factor\u00a0=\u00a017%, voxel size 3.5\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm, 30 axial slices). A varying number of images were acquired per run owing to the self-paced initiation of trials. \n\n\n### Data processing and analysis \n  \nTrials with reaction times (RTs) (for either the number choice or the voluntariness rating) shorter than 0.2\u00a0s or longer than 5\u00a0s were discarded from the analysis. Instructed trials with incorrect responses were also discarded. \n\nTrials from the classical and objective contexts were classified into \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cinstructed\u201d according to the stimulus presented in each trial: e.g., \u201c1 1 1 1\u201d, \u201c2 2 2 2\u201d etc. were classified as instructed, and \u201cX X X X\u201d was classified as free. In contrast, trials from the subjective context were classified into \u201cfeels free\u201d and \u201cfeels instructed\u201d by means of a median split on the distribution of each participants\u2019 subjective reports. The median for each participant was calculated on the basis of all the valid trials (>0.2\u00a0s and <5\u00a0s of reaction time \u2013 RT) across all four subjective context blocks. Thus, the meaning of \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cinstructed\u201d is not identical across contexts, so the design is not fully factorial. Rather, our interest focussed on assessing whether the different ways of defining free and instructed in the different contexts would be based on qualitatively different neural structures. \n\nThe fMRI data were analysed with statistical parametric mapping, using the SPM8 software (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London, London, UK). The first four scans of all EPI series were excluded from the analysis to minimise T1 relaxation artefacts. A mean image for all scan volumes was created, to which individual volumes were spatially realigned by rigid body transformation. The high resolution structural image was coregistered with the mean image of the EPI series. The structural image was normalised to the Montreal Neurological Institute template. The normalisation parameters were then applied to the EPI images to ensure an anatomically informed normalisation. A commonly applied filter of 8\u00a0mm FWHM (full-width at half maximum) was used. The time series data at each voxel were processed using a high-pass filter with a cut-off of 128\u00a0s to remove low-frequency drifts. The subject-level statistical analyses were performed using the general linear model. The events were defined as the onset time of the stem and response grid. Movement times were also included as parametric regressors to account for variance associated with simple motor activations. All resulting vectors were convolved with the canonical haemodynamic response function (HRF) and its temporal derivative to form the main regressors in the design matrix (the regression model). Realignment parameters in all 6 dimensions were also entered in the model to account for variance associated with head motion. The statistical parameter estimates were computed separately for each voxel for all columns in the design matrix. Contrast images were constructed from each individual to compare the relevant parameter estimates for the regressors containing the canonical HRF. The group-level random effects analysis was then performed. The resulting maps were thresholded with\u00a0  p\u00a0  <\u00a0.001 and cluster-size corrected by means of Monte Carlo simulation. Accordingly significant effects were reported when the volume of the cluster was greater than the Monte Carlo simulation determined minimum cluster size volume (25 voxels), above which the probability of type I error was below 0.05 ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioural results \n  \nVoluntariness ratings varied widely both within and between participants. To investigate variation between participants, we calculated the median of each participant\u2019s voluntariness ratings across all blocks. This median had a mean value across participants of 4.05 (\u00b11.68 SD). Variation within participants was considered as a function of free vs instructed trials. Trials in the classical and objective contexts were classified as free or instructed   a priori  ; whilst trials in the subjective context were classified   a posteriori  , on the basis of the participants\u2019 subjective reports. To validate the design and analysis, we examined the overall distribution (for all participants) of the ratings of voluntariness for the objective free and instructed conditions separately. Overall, the proportion of free trials (\u201cX X X X\u201d displayed) subjectively classified as instructed was 0.041%, and the proportion of instructed trials (e.g. \u201c2 2 2 2\u201d displayed) subjectively classified as free was 0.043%. This shows that an   a posteriori   classification criterion (according to voluntariness ratings) closely matched the   a priori   classification criterion (according to the information presented in the stimulus). This implies that in the objective condition, participants used the VAS participants as we expected. \n\nTo evaluate whether there were any differences in behaviour across conditions, mean RTs were obtained for free and instructed conditions (see  ). Because the meaning of   free   and   instructed   was not identical in the objective and subjective contexts (see later), a factorial ANOVA was not appropriate. Instead, we compared free and instructed trials in each context, using paired   t  -tests. There were no differences between the RTs for free and instructed trials in the objective context (  t  \u00a0=\u00a00.68,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.503). However, instructed trials in the subjective context were consistently associated with longer RTs, as compared to free trials in the subjective context (  t  \u00a0=\u00a04.93,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001). This may reflect the fact that instructed conditions in the subjective context imposed more complex restrictions on the possible choices, and therefore slower selection processes. \n\n#### Subjective context \u2013 behavioural analysis \n  \nAs an initial approach to the behavioural analysis of the chosen numbers, we examined whether participants were following an exclusion rule for the stem completion task. The reported voluntariness ratings might then simply reflect exclusion behaviour. We classified trials in a binary fashion. Exclusion trials were defined as those in which the number chosen was not included in the presented stimulus space. In contrast, inclusion trials were those in which the number chosen was included in the stimulus space. This analysis could only be computed for trials with at least one number repetition. Results showed that participants predominantly excluded the numbers present in the stimulus space. We computed the exclusion ratio as the proportion of exclusion trials to the total number of valid trials. The mean exclusion ratio was 0.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15 (\u00b1SD), and was significantly different from 0.5, which would indicate no preference for exclusion behaviour (  t  \u00a0=\u00a04.06,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001). However, the voluntariness ratings were not solely related to an exclusion vs. inclusion factor. The voluntariness ratings for exclusion trials and inclusion trials were 4.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.54 and 4.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6 respectively, and they were not significantly different (  t  \u00a0=\u00a01.7,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.1). \n\nTo further analyse which factors may have influenced participants\u2019 feelings of voluntariness, we investigated whether the number of different digits in the presented sequence (i.e., the \u201cstimulus space\u201d) might determine the degree of perceived voluntariness. We therefore computed the correlation between the size of the stimulus space and the voluntariness rating for each subject (see  ). A trend analysis revealed a significant and positive linear relationship   F  (1,\u00a022)\u00a0=\u00a018.16,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.001) between feeling of voluntariness and stimulus space size. A sequence with only one number represented (e.g., \u201c3 3 3 3\u201d) has a stimulus space of 1. These sequences with small stimulus spaces were associated with responses having the lowest voluntariness ratings, perhaps because participants experienced such stimuli as strongly discouraging a free choice \u201c3\u201d as the response. In contrast, sequences with stimulus spaces of 4 (e.g., \u201c3 2 1 4\u201d) were associated with the highest voluntariness ratings, perhaps because they appeared to offer no particular constraint on participants\u2019 choice. While these suggested explanations of perceived voluntariness as interesting possibilities, they are tangential to our main aim, to investigate the neural correlates of perceived voluntariness. \n\n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \n#### Classical context, free vs. instructed \n  \nWe first indentified brain areas showing a differential BOLD activity for the two externally-defined conditions; free and instructed. This contrast served effectively as a functional localizer. The brain areas identified were used to define regions of interest (ROIs) in which BOLD activity for free and instructed trials was analysed for the independent data obtained from the remaining two contexts. \n\nThe contrast free\u00a0>\u00a0instructed in the classical context revealed increased BOLD signal in RCZ/SMA, bilateral inferior parietal sulcus (IPL) left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left premotor cortex (PMC) (see  ). These findings are consistent with existent report of free action\u00a0>\u00a0instructed action contrasts ( ). \n\n\n#### ROI analysis in objective and subjective contexts \n  \nThe ROIs identified in the free\u00a0>\u00a0instructed contrasts in the classical context were tested in independent data from the two other contexts; namely subjective and objective contexts. \n\nFree and instructed conditions could not be taken to be equivalent across the objective and subjective contexts, for two main reasons. First, free and instructed conditions in the subjective case were expected to relate to degrees of voluntariness along a continuum, rather than representing categorically different situations. Second, \u201cnoise\u201d due to errors in subjective report might have reduced the strength of the contrast between free and instructed conditions in the subjective context, relative to the objective context. For these reasons, a factorial analysis was not appropriate. Instead, for each separate context, we compared per cent signal change for free and forced conditions. This analysis was done within each of the ROIs identified by the free\u00a0>\u00a0instructed contrast in the classical context (see   and  ). \n\nThe only difference between the classical context, used to identify the ROIs, and the objective context is that the latter also included a VAS judgement. Thus, unsurprisingly, all six ROIs analysed showed increased levels of BOLD activity in the free condition as compared to the instructed conditions in the objective context. \n\nStrikingly however, when this analysis was repeated in the subjective context, the pattern of BOLD activity did not match the one in the classical context (see   and  ). Indeed, in five of the six ROIs analysed, the difference in BOLD activity between free and instructed conditions was reversed in the subjective context compared to the objective context. In two ROIs (right IPL and left PM) this reversed pattern was statistically significant. In these areas, BOLD activity was statistically   lower   for actions that had felt free as compared to actions that had felt less free, but was nevertheless statistically higher for actions that were objectively free, as compared to instructed. \n\n\n#### Subjective context \u2013 whole brain analysis \n  \nBOLD activity associated with voluntary choice as identified by subjective report did not match with that identified by a classical contrast between free and instructed actions. Specifically, in those areas identified by classical free\u00a0>\u00a0instructed choice, we found no evidence for stronger activity when participants felt subjectively more free compared to when they felt subjectively less free. In this sense, objectively and subjectively defined free choice did not overlap. However, no direct inferences about an interaction effect can be made by the simple combination of one significant and one non-significant   t  -test ( ). Therefore, to further examine the mechanisms associated with the feeling of voluntariness, and their relationship to the objective operationalization of free action, we did a whole-brain analysis for the contrast free\u00a0>\u00a0instructed (median split) in the subjective context controlling for stimulus space and RT by including them as regressors in the first-level model. Only one area, in the medial postcentral region, showed increased BOLD signal for this contrast after whole-brain correction by means of a Monte Carlo simulation (see  ). BOLD signal showed two peaks of activity in this region, in MNI coordinates (  x  \u00a0=\u00a04   y  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221221   z  \u00a0=\u00a049) and (  x  \u00a0=\u00a00   y  \u00a0=\u00a0\u221228   z  \u00a0=\u00a053. This pattern of BOLD activation did not share any commonalities with the pattern found for the contrast free\u00a0>\u00a0instructed in the objective context, confirming the results from the ROI analysis. \n\nFinally, we looked for BOLD signal activations that were parametrically modulated by the subjective rating of voluntariness in a whole brain analysis. No areas showed BOLD that survived the correction for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nFree action has classically been operationalized as action in underdetermined external environments. It has been contrasted to instructed action, in which actions are fully specified by external stimuli. Although this objective operationalization does not make explicit reference to the subjective experience of acting freely, the objective and subjective freedom of action are often implicitly assumed to be related, see for example ( ). \n\nWe have investigated the relation between the classic operational definitions of free and instructed action and the subjective feeling of acting freely. Participants chose in each trial one out of four response alternatives. We measured BOLD activations in classical conditions in which these free and instructed actions were defined in the objective, classical way, either leaving the response choice to the participant (free trials), or fully specifying the required response in each trial (instructed trials). Our results were in line with previous literature. In particular, we confirmed that medial frontal and parietal BOLD activity is associated with free actions. Results of the comparison between free and instructed conditions showed significantly greater BOLD responses for free compared with instructed in RCZ/SMA, left DLPFC, bilateral IPL and left PMC. These results are consistent with previous reports ( ). When participants were additionally asked to rate how free their choices felt, subjective reports in this objective context were consistent with the operational definitions of free and instructed choice, and BOLD contrasts replicated previous studies. This part of our results is broadly consistent with the classical view of voluntary action, and confirms a relation between internal generation of action and the experience of volition ( ). \n\nWe next compared this pattern of BOLD activations with those obtained in a subjective context where participants selected actions according to the combination of a numerical stimulus stem and a completion rule (\u201clook random\u201d). The completion rule aimed at providing each participant with a situation in which they could experience an ecologically valid graded sense of voluntariness. \n\nWe assumed that participants might use completion rules to conform to the required \u201crandom appearance\u201d of sequences. The precise completion rule (e.g., repetition avoidance, ( ) could vary across participants according to their conceptions of randomness. \n\nAlthough the completion rule was not considered to be critical in the context of this experiment, we also investigated participants\u2019 number choices, and voluntariness ratings. As an initial approach, we measured the number of exclusion trials (those in which the number chosen was not included in the presented stem). Participants indeed tended to base their number choice on an exclusion strategy. Crucially however, the mean voluntariness ratings did not differ between exclusion trials and inclusion trials, suggesting that participants based their voluntariness ratings on other factors, and that the BOLD contrast between choices subjectively rated as free vs. instructed cannot be simply explained by exclusion-related activity. \n\nAlso, and as it was mentioned above, stems with large stimulus spaces (i.e., no number repetitions) did not allow participants to use an exclusion rule, but were at the same time rated most consistently as free. Therefore, the ability to use an exclusion rule (i.e., simply choose the number that is not included in the stem) is unlikely to be the core of feeling free. \n\nHowever, the actual rules used for \u201crandom\u201d generation are not relevant for our analysis, and the requirement to generate random numbers served merely to provide a plausible response space within which some responses might seem more free than others. We considered this subjective experience, independently of the precise completion rule adopted, and of the particular response given. We contrasted trials associated with higher subjective ratings to those with lower subjective ratings of voluntariness. \n\nThe neural correlates of the subjective feeling of freedom were quite different from the neural correlates of free choice as classically operationalized. Our ROI analysis revealed that in five of the ROIs identified (ACC, bilateral IPL, left DLPFC and left PMC), BOLD activity in the objective context was higher for free trials as compared with instructed trials. In stark opposition, in the subjective context BOLD activity showed a trend to be lower for free trials in these five ROIs. Only one area, the precuneus, showed the same pattern of BOLD activity in the objective and subjective contexts. Univariate increases in precuneus BOLD activity are not typically associated with voluntary action. Instead, the precuneus has been linked to self-referential tasks and experience of agency ( ). Intriguingly however, multivariate patterns of activity in this area can predict outcomes of free choices ( ). This may speculatively suggest a hierarchical position for the precuneus in the free generation of response alternatives. \n\nA whole brain fMRI analysis identified a cluster of BOLD activation in a medial postcentral area correlating with the reported subjective feelings of free\u00a0>\u00a0instructed choices. This did not overlap with any of the areas identified by the free\u00a0>\u00a0instructed contrast in the classical context. Our results suggest that the classic operationalization of free action and the subjective experience of choosing freely are dissociated. \n\nAn account of voluntary action based on subjective report revealed a brain area that had not been reported before in this context. The increase in BOLD activity in the medial postcentral cortex correlated with the subjective feeling of freedom in choosing actions, but was not related to the objective informational definition of free action. Therefore, we argue that the feeling of acting freely in naturalistic situations may be independent of the classical free/instructed distinctions. \n\nOur results give rise to three main questions. First, why does the subjective experience of acting freely dissociate from the classical experimental manipulations of free action? Second, what is the functional relevance of the postcentral area found to be related to subjective feelings of acting freely? And finally, what is the significance of subjective report in the study of volition? \n\n### Why are objective and subjective contexts dissociated? \n  \nTo understand why the subjective experience of acting freely does not correspond to the objective operationalization of free action, we examined which responses were reported to be based on free choices. \n\nWe compared the mean voluntariness ratings across all possible stimulus set sizes (where the stimulus set size was defined at the number of different numbers present in the stem). Participants judged that sequences with low stimulus spaces (e.g. \u201c3 3 3 3\u201d) were felt more instructed ones, perhaps because a voluntary response to these sequences would have strongly precluded choosing the repeated response (e.g., \u201c3\u201d). In contrast, sequences with stimulus spaces of 4 (e.g., \u201c3 2 1 4\u201d) were associated with the highest voluntariness ratings, perhaps because they appeared to offer no particular constraint on participants\u2019 choice. \n\nThis behavioural result interestingly suggests that perceived voluntariness in our task is not related to the number of available alternatives but from how strongly the environment is interpreted as precluding otherwise available alternatives. We do not know the rules or mechanisms that participants used to select actions in the subjective context. Therefore, the cognitive processes in subjective and objective contexts may differ, limiting our ability to compare them. However, we cross-validated perceived voluntariness ratings with the free/instructed conditions in the objective context. The success of this validation suggests that our design would reveal any possible contribution of the brain mechanisms for free choice of action to subjective voluntariness. Since no such contribution was found, we tentatively conclude that subjective voluntariness dissociates from the brain systems that are objectively involved in internal generation of action. \n\n\n### Alternative accounts \n  \nSeveral alternative explanations for the dissociation between objective and subjective context should be considered here. We found differences in the patterns of BOLD activity associated with the free\u00a0>\u00a0instructed contrast between the objective and subjective contexts. Clearly, the two contexts differed in more than one respect. For example, the subjective context required a complex evaluation of the number sequence and may have recruited random generation processes ( ). In addition, our design included a memory question about the number sequences in the subjective, but not the objective context. However, we argue that the differences in BOLD activity that we identified between objective and subjective contexts cannot be easily explained by differences in task demands. Mental processes such as random number generation would have occurred in   both   free and forced trials within the subjective context, and in   none   of the trials in the objective context. Consequently, the comparison between free and forced trials   within   each context would have subtracted out any potential BOLD activity that was directly related to differential task demands. \n\nAdditionally, the differences in patterns of BOLD activations may be related to the nature of the free/instructed distinction in each context. There is a strong and categorical difference between free and instructed trials in the objective context. Conversely, the difference between free and instructed trials in the subjective context is slight and gradual. One might therefore predict smaller differences between free and forced conditions in the subjective context as compared to the objective context. This was not the case. There was a trend in all ROIs identified (except the precuneus) for an   inversion   of the pattern of BOLD activation in the subjective context, as compared with the objective context. This trend became significant in two of the 6 ROIs analysed, namely the right IPL and left PM. More importantly, the free\u00a0>\u00a0instructed contrast in the subjective context revealed significant increases in BOLD activity in the postcentral area that were not significant in the objective context. \n\nTo account for an inversion in patterns of BOLD activity, it would be necessary to appeal to an implausible inversion of the meaning of the terms \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cinstructed\u201d on the part of our participants. Therefore, we argue that simple differences in the nature of free and instructed contexts cannot easily account for the results reported here. \n\nInstead, we argue that the subjective feeling of acting freely may be associated with increased BOLD activity in the postcentral area. However, other more speculative explanations cannot be ruled out. For example, activity in the medial postcentral cortex may mediate increased difficulty in finding a random-looking sequence, or other differences related to task processing such as the amount of information that was taken into consideration for the number choice. \n\nImportantly however, previous data do not strongly support these alternative accounts. In particular, increases in task difficulty are typically associated with prefrontal, rather than medial-central, areas (e.g.,  ). \n\n\n### The role of restricted choice on BOLD activity \n  \nTrials in the subjective context represent an intermediate situation, between the two objective extremes of free and instructed actions. In other words, even those trials subjectively judged as instructed will require a certain degree of choice. \n\nTwo relevant studies have addressed the effect of varying degrees of choice on BOLD activity.   designed a task selection experiment, in which participants were either instructed on which task to perform, or could choose the task between either two or three task alternatives. They found that BOLD activity in RCZ was higher for task choice conditions, but did not vary with the   scope   of choice (i.e., two vs. three possible tasks). This may explain why we did not find BOLD signal increases in the classical areas related to free choice in the subjective context. However, and importantly, limited set of response alternatives cannot readily explain the increase in BOLD activity in the medial postcentral region. \n\nIn a previous study ( ) participants were asked to freely select one out of a number of available response alternatives, ranging from 1 to 4. This design, which did not include a subjective judgement component, allowed the authors to compare conditions of no selection (one available alternative) and restricted selection (between 2 and 3 available alternatives. If the medial postcentral activation is simply due to a limited availability of alternatives, then we should also have found the activation observed in the study by   in the contrast of restricted selection\u00a0>\u00a0no selection conditions. Their contrast revealed increased BOLD activity in frontal, premotor and parietal areas, but not in the medial postcentral cortex that we report here. The results by Van Eimeren (2006) do not support the possibility that the BOLD activation in the medial postcentral area is simply related to the limited response space of alternatives. \n\n\n### What is the function of the medial postcentral region? \n  \nCould the activation in the medial postcentral area be due to a confound in our task, rather than a true correlate of experience of free choice? Here we examine this possibility. \n\nIn tasks requiring free selection, human participants typically hold their previous responses in working memory. Monitoring the contents of working memory can then prevent repetition of behaviour, and can promote generation of seemingly random response sequences ( ). Consequently, working memory acts as a confound that is hard to separate from free selection. Increased working memory load has been associated with increases in BOLD activity in IPL ( ), but not in DLPFC ( ). Given that the objective context led to relatively little cognitive load, it is possible that participants were additionally monitoring their previous history of choices when selecting a response. This would have meant increased working memory function in the objective context. . On the other hand, the more cognitively demanding subjective context may have precluded working memory effects on free trials. This could explain the attenuation of BOLD activity in the ROIs we analysed. However, we found not just attenuation, but an inversion of the free-instructed difference in the subjective compared to the objective context. Working memory accounts cannot easily explain this inversion. \n\nThe phenomenology of free action has rarely been addressed experimentally, despite a strong theoretical interest in the issue ( ), but see ( ). The paracentral area that we found to correlate with the experience of free choice has been related to resting state activity ( ) and default network functions ( ). However, this area is not generally identified as a core component of the default mode network. Nevertheless, our data remain compatible with the idea that this area may be linked to reflective processes that give rise to the conscious feeling of free will ( ). \n\n\n### What is the value of relying on subjective experience? \n  \nSubjective report provides unique access to phenomenal consciousness ( ), but is notoriously problematic as a guide to neural bases of experience   have recently considered neural correlates of subjective experience related to voluntary action. In an MEG study, the authors investigated the neural substrates of sensory events, of actual movements, and of intentions to move. In addition, they characterised the neural substrates of introspection about the timing of each of these events. They found that the spatial extent of the neural correlates of introspection of events did not match the neural loci of the first order events at which introspection was directed (but see   for the opposite result). Our study mirrors that by   in the sense that the brain areas that underlie introspection about a given process (here the feeling of free choice between action alternatives) do not necessarily match the first order processes to which introspection refers (i.e., choosing between action alternatives). \n\nSeveral other studies have directly addressed the subjective experience of intending to act. These studies have revealed an involvement of both frontal and parietal areas in the phenomenology of intended action. For example,   found that direct electrical stimulation to medial frontal cortex led to subjective \u201curges\u201d to act. More recently, K\u00fchn and Haggard ( ) found that BOLD activity in a caudal portion of SMA correlated with the strength of the \u201ctemporal binding\u201d effect, an implicit marker of agency ( ). On the other hand,   reported the conscious experience of intending to act following direct stimulation of the parietal cortex. These studies have associated medio-frontal and lateral parietal areas to the feeling of intended action, but not the postcentral area that we report here. One important difference between those studies and ours should be pointed out. In those studies, the timing of action was not specified. Consequently, the subjective experience of action intention may be related to the feeling of impending action. In our experiment, in contrast, an action was to be made at a specific time. Actions could only differ in terms of their freedom of constraint by the external environment. Therefore, the subjective experience reported here did not have to do with the feeling of being about to act, but rather with the feeling of internal generation of one of a range of response alternatives. \n\nImportantly, our results do not undermine the validity of classical operational distinctions between free and instructed choice, nor do they rule out some relation between the operational distinction and the experience of voluntariness. However, our results do suggest that the experience of voluntariness is not simply a consequence of the same brain processes involved in free action selection. Where then, does the experience of free choice arise? There are at least two possibilities. First, the feeling of freely choosing might be confabulated ( ), rather than being a   bona fide   experience at all. Indeed, evidence from choosing between alternative manual responses suggests that the experience of volition is only generated by processes occurring   after   action selection, rather than before ( ). On this view, the process of selection itself would be phenomenally silent. Second, the experiences of voluntary choice might arise from a pathway parallel to the (unconscious) pathway that generates action itself ( ). \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nOur experiment relates to the traditional philosophical question of \u201cfree will\u201d. Regardless of whether freedom of will exists or not, most people would agree that they generally feel that   they   choose their own actions ( ). We did not aim to contribute to the debate over whether free will exists. Rather, we tried to investigate the   experience   of free will scientifically. The subjective experience of free choice may be a phenomenal experience similar to other phenomenal experiences, and dependent on a distinct neural substrate ( ). Our results suggest that this experience may not derive from brain circuits involved in action selection, but from quite different brain circuits. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: t0005\n### Label: Table 1\nArea\tPeak coordinates (MNI space)\tPeak coordinates (MNI space)\tPeak coordinates (MNI space)\tPeak z-score\tCluster size (number of voxels)\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tx\ty\tz\tUnnamed: 4_level_1\tUnnamed: 5_level_1\nRight IPL\t35\t\u221263\t42\t5.42\t206\nLeft IPL\t\u221228\t\u221270\t46\t4.88\t217\nRCZ/SMA\t\u22124\t18\t49\t4.82\t286\nLeft DLPFC\t\u221235\t49\t7\t4.7\t113\nPrecuneus\t11\t\u221270\t53\t4.62\t85\nLeft PM\t\u221242\t4\t39\t4.2\t112\n### Caption\nResults of whole brain analysis in the classical context (free\u00a0>\u00a0instructed).

Thirty-two healthy volunteers were studied by conventional MR imaging and resting-state fMRI prior to and 0.5 hours after initiation of acute alcohol administration. The fMRI data, acquired during the resting state, were correlated with different breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC). We use the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus as a seed for the default mode network (DMN) analysis. ALFF and ReHo were also used to investigate spontaneous neural activity in the resting state. Conventional MR imaging showed no abnormalities on all subjects. Compared with the prior alcohol administration, the ALFF and ReHo also indicated some specific brain regions which are affected by alcohol, including the superior frontal gyrus, cerebellum, hippocampal gyrus, left basal ganglia, and right internal capsule. Functional connectivity of the DMN was affected by alcohol. This resting-state fMRI indicates that brain regions implicated are affected by alcohol and might provide a neural basis for alcohol's effects on behavioral performance. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nAlcohol impairs cognitive function and is associated with a variety of behavioral changes resulting in deficits in perceptual and emotional function. Alcohol consumption has immediate effects on multiple cognitive-motor processing domains and leads to damage of multiple attentional abilities [ ]. Previously, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to understand the effects of alcohol on the human brain. Five independent critical brain circuits are significantly affected by relatively high levels (blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) = 0.1%) of alcohol, and functional network connectivity between the frontal-temporal-basal ganglia and the cerebellar circuits is specifically disrupted [ ,  ]. However, these studies were performed under task-based conditions. \n\nRecently, resting-state fMRI techniques have been applied to demonstrate abnormalities in various neuropsychiatric disorders [ ,  ]. The BOLD signal has been confirmed to indirectly reflect neural activity. The default mode network (DMN) has first been observed as a task-negative network, showing increased metabolic demand during the \u201cbaseline\u201d activity and has therefore been hypothesized to reflect intrinsic default brain processes [ ]. The DMN spans the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu), retrosplenial cortex (RspC), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), parts of the hippocampal formation, and the temporal lobe. A research indicated that the PCC/PCu node is particularly noteworthy, since after conditioning it was the only node in the DMN that directly interacted with virtually all other nodes. The PCC/PCu may play a pivotal role in how intrinsic activity is mediated throughout the DMN [ ]. \n\nRegional homogeneity (ReHo), a novel method that measures the functional connectivity, has been developed to analyze the local synchronization of spontaneous fMRI BOLD signals, reflecting the coherence of spontaneous neuronal activity [ ]. Unlike the functional connectivity involved in long-distance interregional temporal correlations of BOLD signals, ReHo, using Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC), displays the functional coherence of a given voxel with its nearest neighbors within a single region [ ]. The low-frequency (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) fluctuations (LFFs) of the resting-state fMRI signal were found to be physiologically important, reflecting spontaneous neuronal activity [ ]. ALFF was used to study several areas of neuroscience and neurological diseases including healthy aging, schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ ]. \n\nTo assess the ability of fMRI to detect the acute effects of alcohol on healthy human brains, we used resting-state fMRI methods to investigate changes in the brain; we hypothesized that acute alcohol administration may alter connectivity measures of the resting-state DMN and have different ReHo and ALFF values in some brain areas when compared with controls. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Subjects \n  \nThirty-two healthy right-handed volunteers (17 men, 15 women; 25\u201327 years old) were examined by MRI before and after administration of alcohol. To be eligible for the study, potential volunteers were interviewed via telephone and asked a number of questions concerning their general health and medical history, in addition to questions especially related to their history of alcohol use and abuse. All participants provided written informed consent to the study, which was approved by the local ethics committee of the university hospital and institutional review boards. Participants consumed alcohol at a frequency of less than once per week and had no self-reported history of neurological disease, substance abuse, head trauma, CNS tumors, or psychoactive prescriptive medication usage. To ensure that the alcohol dose received in the study would be within the participants' normal range of experience, we excluded very heavy drinkers. To avoid interfering with alcohol absorption, subjects were requested to avoid consuming alcohol for 24\u2009h and refrain from eating for 6\u2009h prior to the study appointment. All participants were given a hand-held breathalyzer test to measure baseline alcohol levels, assuring participants were not already under the influence of alcohol. \n\n#### 2.1.1. Behavioral Evaluation \n  \nBefore and after alcohol administration, subjects were asked to evaluate their subjective sense of headache, excitement, dizziness, sleepiness, or confusion. \n\n\n#### 2.1.2. Study Protocol \n  \nSubjects passing the screening process were invited to participate in the study. Before alcohol administration, we performed BOLD imaging using MRI to determine the baseline, making each participant serve as a control for the individual alcohol effect. After the examination, each received a dose of 0.65\u2009g of alcohol per kilogram body weight orally within 10 minutes. The alcohol was given in the form of spirit (53\u00b0 Maotai spirit, 2010, Renhuai, Guizhou, China). All drinks were mixed with some food, such as peanuts. BrAC is an index helping to estimate blood alcohol levels. BrAC was measured before and after each scan session using a hand-held breathalyzer 0.5 hours after alcohol administration. The subjects had to wait for 30 minutes until the BrAC reached its approximate maximum after alcohol administration [ ]. Participants were divided into two groups according to the BrAC: a low BrAC group (BrAC = 0\u20130.36\u2009mg/L) and a high BrAC group (BrAC > 0.36\u2009mg/L). There were 16 participants in each group. \n\n\n\n### 2.2. MR Imaging \n  \nAll anatomical and BOLD-sensitive MRI data were acquired using gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences in a 1.5T MRI scanner (GE) with an eight-channel-phased array head coil. Foam pads were used to reduce head movements and scanner noise. To measure the individual fMRI data, the imaging parameters were set as follows: slice thickness = 5\u2009mm, slice gap = 1\u2009mm, TR = 2,000\u2009ms, TE = 30\u2009ms, FOV = 24\u2009cm \u00d7 24\u2009cm, flip angle = 90\u00b0, and matrix = 64 \u00d7 64. 180 volumes (20 slices per volume) were acquired during 360\u2009s of an fMRI run. During data acquisition, subjects were required to relax with eyes closed, not to fall asleep, and to move as little as possible. For anatomic data sets, we used a 3D-BRAVO sequence (thickness: 1.4\u2009mm (no gap), TR = 8.2\u2009ms, TE = 1.0\u2009ms, FOV = 24\u2009cm \u00d7 24\u2009cm, flip angle = 25\u00b0, and matrix = 256 \u00d7 256). \n\n\n### 2.3. Data Processing \n  \nPreprocessing of fMRI data was carried out using SPM8 and DPARSF software (  and  ). The first 10 volumes of each functional time series were discarded for the magnetization equilibrium. Head motion parameters were computed by estimating translational and rotational parameters. Each subject had a maximum displacement in a data set that did not exceed \u00b11.5\u2009mm or \u00b11.5\u00b0. Functional images were normalized to a standard EPI template and interpolated to 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3\u2009mm cubic voxels. Following this step, all data were copied to two parts: one was smoothed with a 4\u2009mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) for functional connectivity and ALFF analysis and the other one was not smoothed for ReHo analysis. Then, data were temporal band-pass filtered (0.01 <   f   < 0.08\u2009Hz) to reduce the effects of low-frequency drift and physiological high-frequency noise [ ], and the linear trend was removed. \n\n\n### 2.4. DMN Evaluation \n  \nThe functional connectivity of DMN was calculated using the REST software ( ). The voxel-based correlation approach was used to evaluate the temporally correlated BOLD signal associated with the functional connectivity of the DMN. We make a mask of PCC/PCu which was selected as regions of interest (ROI) from automated anatomical labeling (ALL) atlas. The averaged time course was then computed from each sphere and the correlation analysis was performed in a voxelwise way to generate the functional connectivity of the PCC/PCu. Prior to the correlation analysis, a linear regression was performed to remove the effects of nuisance covariates: the global mean signal, the white matter signal, the cerebrospinal fluid signal, and six head motion parameters. After that, the correlation coefficient maps were converted into   z   maps by Fisher's   r  -to-  z   transform to improve the normality. \n\n\n### 2.5. ReHo Calculation \n  \nReHo was defined as Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC) to study the similarity of the time series within a functional cluster based on the regional homogeneity hypothesis [ ]. In the current study, ReHo was used as the KCC of a given voxel with its 26 nearest neighboring voxels. These 27 voxels were defined as a cluster. The individual ReHo map was generated by calculating the KCC in a voxelwise way with free DPARSF software ( ). Then we used a default mask (made from the EPI template in the REST software) to remove nonbrain tissue, and, for standardization purposes, the individual ReHo map was divided by its own mean KCC value within the mask [ ,  ]. \n\n\n### 2.6. ALFF Calculation \n  \nALFF was calculated using DPARSF software ( ). For a given voxel, the filtered time series was transformed to a frequency domain with a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain the power spectrum. Then the power spectrum was square-rooted and averaged across 0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz at each voxel. This averaged square root was taken as the ALFF [ ]. For standardization purposes, the ALFF of each voxel was divided by the global mean ALFF value that was only within the brain and without the background and tissues outside the brain. The standardized ALFF of each voxel should have a value of about 1. This standardization procedure is analogous to that used in PET studies [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.7. Statistical Analysis \n  \n#### 2.7.1. Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nTo determine brain regions that showed significant positive correlations, one-sample   t  -tests were performed on the individual   z   maps of the PCC/PCu. The statistical threshold was set at   P   < 0.001 and cluster size >6 voxels (AlphaSim corrected). Then, two-sample   t  -tests were used to determine group differences in the functional connectivity with significant correlations within each group. A corrected threshold of   P   < 0.01 and cluster size >18 voxels (AlphaSim corrected) were set to show a significant difference with each group. \n\n\n#### 2.7.2. ALFF and ReHo Analysis \n  \nOne-sample two-sided   t  -tests were performed within each group to show whether the standardized KCC value and ALFF differed from the value of one [ ]. Then, two-sample   t  -tests were performed to see the ReHo and ALFF difference between the subjects before and after alcohol administration and also between subjects with different BrAC. For ALFF analysis, voxels with a   P   value <0.01 and cluster size >10 voxels were considered to show a significant difference between two groups when analyzed using REST software ( ). For ReHo, a   P   value <0.01 and cluster size >25 voxels were used to indicate a significant difference. \n\n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Effects of Alcohol on the Central and Peripheral Nervous System \n  \nAlcohol consumption changed the mood and behavior of the persons tested. Subjects in the low BrAC group complained of headache (  n   = 10), dizziness (  n   = 7), increasing speech (  n   = 9), and feeling tired (  n   = 12). Subjects in the high BrAC group also showed headache (  n   = 14), dizziness (  n   = 13), excitement (  n   = 8), walking unsteadily (  n   = 9), nausea (  n   = 5), and confusion (  n   = 5). \n\n\n### 3.2. Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nThe one-sample   t  -test of control group revealed that the intragroup maps of connectivity to PCC/PCu of resting-state network are similar to the DMN. It includes the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, retrosplenial cortex (RspC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and parts of the temporal lobe which comprise the DMN ( ). The decreasing brain regions of connectivity to PCC/PCu of high and low BrAC group were observed prior to alcohol administration. Using the PCC/PCu as a seed for the functional connectivity analysis, we observed significant decreases of connectivity in the bilateral hippocampal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, left superior temporal lobe, left superior frontal gyrus, and left rectus gyrus and increases of connectivity in the left cuneus, left occipital lobe, right superior parietal lobe, right superior frontal gyrus, and right cerebellum in high BrAC group as compared with prior to alcohol administration group ( ). The low BrAC group also showed decreases of connectivity in the left superior and medial frontal lobe, left occipital lobe, left inferior parietal lobe, and right cerebellum and increases of connectivity in the right cuneus ( ). Compared with the low BrAC group, we found that the left rectus gyrus, left cerebellum, right hippocampal gyrus, right superior frontal lobe, bilateral superior temporal lobe, and right fusiform gyrus showed decreases of connectivity and the left medial and superior frontal lobe, right cingulate gyrus, and right cerebellum revealed increases of connectivity in the high BrAC group ( ). \n\n\n### 3.3. ALFF and ReHo Analysis \n  \nTo investigate the ALFF and ReHo difference, a two-sample   t  -test was performed, which showed a significant difference between the two data sets in certain brain areas. Statistical maps of the two-sample   t  -test were created using a combined threshold of   P   < 0.01 and a minimum cluster size of 10 voxels (Tables   and  ) in ALFF and a minimum cluster size of 25 voxels (Tables  ,  , and  ) in ReHo. A lower threshold of   P   < 0.001 was used to see the difference from different BrAC groups in ALFF ( ). Compared with the data obtained prior to alcohol administration, significant positive correlations of the different BrAC groups were observed between ALFF values in the left caudate nucleus, left basal ganglia, left hippocampal gyrus, and left inferior frontal lobe. Negative correlations were also found in the cerebellum, frontal lobe, and temporal lobe. Compared with the low BrAC group, we found a higher ALFF in the right temporal lobe and right parietal lobe and lower ALFF in the bilateral superior frontal lobe (  P   < 0.001, cluster voxels > 10) in the high BrAC group. The higher ReHo values of different BrAC groups in the frontal lobe, cerebellum, right internal capsule, left basal ganglia, left caudate nucleus, left hippocampal gyrus, and left precuneus and lower ReHo values in the frontal lobe, right temporal lobe, right hippocampal gyrus, and left anterior cingulate gyrus (  P   < 0.01, cluster voxels > 25) were found when compared with values obtained prior to alcohol administration. Compared with the low BrAC group, the left midbrain, left middle frontal gyrus, left occipital lobe, right middle temporal lobe, bilateral fusiform gyri, and cerebellum showed a higher ReHo and the bilateral superior frontal lobe, right middle frontal gyrus, right middle and inferior temporal lobe, and cerebellum showed a lower ReHo in the high alcohol group. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nAlcohol leads to dysfunction of cognitive control, causing behavioral disinhibition. The mechanism of alcohol action on brain is still not well understood. Recently, a published study used DTI to detect cytotoxic brain edema after acute effects of alcohol on healthy human brain [ ]. Other studies using fMRI demonstrated disruption in functional network connectivity with alcohol administration during tasks. These studies using independent component analysis (ICA) identified some circuits including the superior, middle, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), primary/supplementary motor areas, frontal-temporal-basal ganglia, cerebellum, and medial prefrontal, inferior parietal, and lateral temporal cortices while driving under the influence of alcohol [ ]. These 5 circuits are significantly affected by relatively high levels (BAC = 0.1%) of alcohol, resulting in both impaired brain function and driving behavior. \n\nThis study investigated the effects of alcohol by detecting the functional connectivity of DMN and using ALFF and ReHo. During a resting state, it may be helpful to further understand abnormalities of brain activity in participants under the acute effect of alcohol, because the absence of demanding cognitive activities and instructions makes it more straightforward to compare brain activity across groups that may differ in motivation or cognitive abilities. To determine which brain regions of healthy person are implicated under the influence of acute alcohol, we examined the acute effects of low (<0.36\u2009mg/L BrAC) and high (>0.36\u2009mg/L BrAC) blood alcohol concentrations. We found that many brain regions showed significant differences in functional connectivity, ReHo, and ALFF between the alcohol administration and before alcohol administration; some other brain regions also showed differences between low and high alcohol administration. From these different analyses, we got some different affected brain regions. ReHo and functional connectivity analyses focus on the similarities of intra- and interregional time series, respectively, and ALFF measures the amplitude of regional activity. \n\nPrevious study examining the brain activation during the fMRI Go/No-Go task suggests decrease in brain activation within the basal ganglia and cerebellum, which comprise parts of networks known to be important for movement and cognition [ ,  ]. The basal ganglia are associated with a variety of functions, including motor control, behaviors learning, cognitive planning, and emotional functions [ ,  ]. The internal capsule is the major route by which the cerebral cortex is connected with the brainstem and spinal cord. The effect on the internal capsule influences the sensory and motor function. The changing ALFF and ReHo in these two regions could affect the control of movement and cognition. Our study showed a higher ReHo of left basal ganglia and right internal capsule in both high and low BrAC group ( ) and a higher ALFF of left basal ganglia in low BrAC group when compared with the control group. But these two regions show no significance when comparing the high BrAC group with the low BrAC group. \n\nRecently, a study indicated significant decrease in connectivity between the frontal-temporal-basal ganglia and cerebellar components during alcohol condition, which might be a vulnerable point to impair one's order cognitive function and motor planning [ ]. Functional imaging studies of normal subjects have suggested the activation of the cerebellum as part of neural networks responsible for motor planning, working memory, executive and spatial functions, language, and emotional processes [ ,  ]. In this study, the ALFF and ReHo of cerebellum either increased or decreased with alcohol administration. It also showed either increased or decreased functional connectivity in the cerebellum. \n\nThere is another region drawing our attention: it is the hippocampal gyrus. The bilateral hippocampal gyri show difference of functional connectivity, ALFF, and ReHo in both high and low BrAC group. A study using DTI to examine the brain indicated that the frontal lobes, thalamus, and middle cerebellar peduncle are especially vulnerable to the effects of alcohol [ ]. The hippocampal gyri play a very important content of memory function and are a critical component of medial temporal lobe memory system [ ,  ]. Since memory is an important part of individual intelligence, the local connectivity of this region correlates with intelligence. The hippocampal gyrus is commonly linked to target/hazard detection in previous fMRI studies [ ]. \n\nIn the current study, the voxel-based functional connectivity using the PCC/PCu as a seed reveals that the positive correlation brain regions are similar to the DMN. This helps to indicate the PCC/PCu is a central node in the DMN [ ]. ALFF and ReHo changes were found in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and hippocampal gyrus, regions that partly comprise the default mode network (DMN). These changes of functional connectivity, ALFF, and ReHo in resting state suggest how alcohol affected the DMN which is responsible for multiple constituent functions, including action, cognition, emotion, interoception, and perception [ ,  ]. The decreasing functional connectivity of DMN occurs mainly on the left hemisphere, which may suggest that the left hemisphere of brain is more sensitive to alcohol-related damage than the opposite hemisphere under the resting state. This finding is different from the previous study, which might suggest that the right hemisphere is more vulnerable to alcohol-related damage than the left hemisphere using functional MRI during memory encoding tasks [ ]. This finding could also be linked to handedness. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nResting-state fMRI could detect brain regions including the superior frontal gyrus, cerebellum, hippocampal gyrus, basal ganglia, and internal capsule which were affected by alcohol. These different brain regions which are related to memory, motor control, cognitive ability, and spatial functions might provide a neural basis for alcohol's effects on behavioral performance. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nBrain regions\tUnnamed: 1\tVoxels\tX (MNI)\tY (MNI)\tZ (MNI)\tT value\nHigh BrAC group < control\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFusiform gyrus\tL\t61.0\t\u221236\t\u22129\t\u221245\t\u22125.4005\nParahippocampal gyrus\tR\t47.0\t\u221221\t3\t\u221233\t\u22124.3482\nHippocampal gyrus\tR\t20.0\t27\t\u221215\t\u221224\t\u22123.7402\nHippocampal gyrus\tL\t27.0\t\u221224\t\u221215\t\u221215\t\u22123.735\nSuperior temporal gyrus\tL\t68.0\t\u221251\t\u22126\t\u221227\t\u22124.2768\nRectus gyrus\tL\t27.0\t3\t39\t\u221227\t\u22123.5673\nFrontal orbital gyrus\tL\t25.0\t\u221215\t33\t\u221218\t\u22124.616\nSuperior frontal gyrus\tL\t31.0\t\u221212\t48\t21\t\u22124.1603\nHigh BrAC group > control\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCerebellum\tR\t19.0\t3\t\u221284\t\u221227\t4.0301\nCuneus\tL\t35.0\t\u22123\t\u2212102\t\u22123\t4.1482\nOccipital gyrus\tL\t22.0\t\u221227\t\u221275\t12\t3.9603\nSuperior parietal lobe\tR\t32.0\t15\t\u221251\t57\t3.7574\nSuperior frontal gyrus\tR\t21.0\t6\t0\t66\t3.8591\n### Caption\nBrain regions with significant differences of functional connectivity are shown between control and high BrAC group (P < 0.01, 18 voxels, AlphaSim corrected).\n### Footer\n\nMNI: Montreal Neurological Institute;

This dual function of dopamine suggests that dopamine might be involved in the generation of active motivated behavior. The DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptor gene (rs1800497) has previously been suggested to affect striatal function with carriers of the less common A1 allele exhibiting reduced striatal D2 receptor density and increased risk for addiction. Here we aimed to investigate the influences of DRD2 TaqIA genotype on the modulation of interference processing by reward and punishment. Forty-six young, healthy volunteers participated in a behavioral experiment, and 32 underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants performed a flanker task with a motivation manipulation (monetary reward, monetary loss, neither, or both). Reaction times (RTs) were shorter in motivated flanker trials, irrespective of congruency. In the fMRI experiment motivation was associated with reduced prefrontal activation during incongruent vs. congruent flanker trials, possibly reflecting increased processing efficiency. DRD2 TaqIA genotype did not affect overall RTs, but interacted with motivation on the congruency-related RT differences, with A1 carriers showing smaller interference effects to reward alone and A2 homozygotes exhibiting a specific interference reduction during combined reward (REW) and punishment trials (PUN). In fMRI, anterior cingulate activity showed a similar pattern of genotype-related modulation. Additionally, A1 carriers showed increased anterior insula activation relative to A2 homozygotes. Our results point to a role for genetic variations of the dopaminergic system in individual differences of cognition-motivation interaction. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe ability to adapt oneself to uncertain, changeable needs of the environment is considered as an outstanding human skill (Collins and Koechlin,  ). These competences comprise the decision making based on exploration, adaptation to found conditions, anticipation of expected results or risks of a given action and a suitable choice from a variety of possible responses to a stimulus (Royall et al.,  ; Gilbert and Burgess,  ; Collins and Koechlin,  ). This complex set of skills is often subsumed under the term   Executive Functions   (EF), a somewhat diffuse umbrella term that attempts to capture the heterogeneity of the psychological processes involved. \n\nDespite their apparent heterogeneity, the brain processes typically considered as EF can be subdivided into three core functions: inhibition (including the control of interference), working memory, and cognitive flexibility (Miyake et al.,  ; Diamond,  ). These core functions support more complex cognitive functions like planning or problem solving and thus have a broad impact on human behavior and social interactions, affecting quality of life, job success as well as physical and mental health (Diamond,  ). \n\nBehavioral and neural manifestations of EF can be investigated in an experimental setting using a variety of well-established paradigms. For example, inhibitory processes can be investigated with the flanker task (Eriksen and Eriksen,  ), the Simon task (Simon and Berbaum,  ) or the Stroop task (MacLeod,  ). In addition to inhibitory processes, successful performance of the flanker task also depends upon selective attention (Posner and Petersen,  ; Diamond,  ). Numerous variations of the flanker task exist, but their common feature is that participants are required to focus on a centrally presented target stimulus while ignoring flanking distractor stimuli. The performance of incongruent trials, during which the target stimulus and the flanking stimuli activate different possible reactions (i.e., responding to the central arrow in >>><>>>), is typically contrasted to the performance of congruent trials, during which the target and the distractors jointly activate one single choice of action (i.e., responding to the central arrow in >>>>>>>). Behaviorally, such interference in flanker tasks is characterized by concomitantly occurring slower reaction times (RTs) and higher error rates in incongruent as compared to congruent trials (Botvinick et al.,  ; Casey et al.,  ; Botvinick et al.,  ; Richter et al.,  ; Bugg and Crump,  ). Further research suggests that the flanker task does not only allow the investigation of inhibition performance, but also action monitoring and error detection (Ullsperger and Von Cramon,  ). \n\nAt the level of neural circuits, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is widely considered to be the key neuroanatomical structure mediating EF. The intrinsic organization of the frontal lobes is complex, and a growing body of clinical studies provides evidence for heterogeneous effects of lesions in distinct PFC subregions on different subprocesses of executive functioning (Funahashi,  ; Royall et al.,  ; Elliott,  ). While most neuroimaging research on EF has focused on frontal brain structures like the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the lateral PFC, these structures typically co-activate with parietal cortical regions (Roberts and Hall,  ), reflecting large-scale attention networks that also show increased connectivity during rest (Fox et al.,  ). Moreover, the PFC interacts with subcortical structures, most notably the striatum and the thalamus (Casey et al.,  ; Fan et al.,  ; Posner and Rothbart,  ). \n\nBecause EF, at least to a large extent, mediate goal-directed behavior, it is conceivable that stimuli associated with potential positive or negative reinforcers are likely to undergo preferential processing (Adcock et al.,  ; Boksem et al.,  ; Krebs et al.,  ; Richter et al.,  ), but, when task-irrelevant, also interfere with the task at hand and influence its neural underpinnings (Wiswede et al.,  ; Padmala and Pessoa,  ; Richter et al.,  ). The association of a stimulus with the possibility to obtain a reward or to avoid an aversive outcome typically renders this stimulus highly salient (Boksem et al.,  ). To elucidate how processes of inhibition and error detection are modulated by such salience, the flanker task can be modified by introducing trials in which participants can receive rewards or avoid penalties upon correct performance (Boksem et al.,  ; Engelmann et al.,  ; Hubner and Schlosser,  ). Boksem and colleagues investigated the relationship between punishment/reward sensitivity (assessed with the Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System questionnaires, BIS/BAS) and electrophysiological correlates of error processing in the flanker task, demonstrating that individual differences in reward and punishment sensitivity affected the amplitude of error-related event-related potential (ERP) components in flanker trials that were associated with reward or punishment, respectively (Boksem et al.,  ). \n\nAdditional evidence for a modulation of PFC/dACC-dependent inhibitory control by motivation comes from stop signal and Stroop tasks. Padmala and Pessoa ( ) used the stop signal-paradigm to investigate the neural mechanisms of cognition-motivation interactions during response inhibition. Selective rewarding of correct go-reactions was associated with longer inhibitory RTs in the rewarded relative to the control condition and with reduced PFC activation in rewarded trials. Compatibly, Krebs et al. ( ) observed that reward anticipation exerted beneficial behavioral effects on Stroop task performance, but reward-associated stimuli also impaired the processing of neutral stimuli. \n\nConverging evidence from patient studies, psychopharmacology and genetic investigations suggests that variability of prefrontal dopaminergic neurotransmission contributes substantially to the widely observed individual differences in PFC-dependent EF (Mattay et al.,  ; Meyer-Lindenberg and Weinberger,  ; Stelzel et al.,  ; Barnes et al.,  ; Tan et al.,  ). Most studies investigating the impact of the dopaminergic system on PFC function have focused on catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), an enzyme primarily involved in cortical, but not striatal dopamine clearance (Tunbridge et al.,  ), but there is increasing evidence for a delicately balanced mutual regulation of prefrontal and striatal dopamine turnover (Meyer-Lindenberg et al.,  ,  ,  ). The dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) is the predominant postsynaptic dopamine receptor in the striatum, but sparsely expressed in the PFC. Presynaptic, autoinhibitory D2 receptors, on the other hand, play an important role in the regulation of dopamine release throughout the brain. Given this dual role of DRD2, it seems plausible that genetically mediated individual differences of DRD2 expression affect both human striatal and prefrontal neural processes. A commonly investigated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linked to the DRD2 gene on chromosome 11q22-23 is the so-called TaqIA polymorphism, which is characterized by a polymorphic restriction site. The TaqIA polymorphism has been repeatedly associated with alterations of striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission. Despite the fact that the underlying molecular mechanisms are yet not fully understood, a number of studies have provided converging evidence for reduced DRD2 expression in homozygous and heterozygous carriers of the less common A1 allele relative to homozygotes of the A2 allele.   Post mortem   investigations and positron emission tomography (PET) suggest that A1 carriers show a 30\u201340% decrease in DRD2 density compared to A2 homozygotes in the striatum (Thompson et al.,  ; Pohjalainen et al.,  ; Jonsson et al.,  ; Ritchie and Noble,  ). One study employing single photon emission tomography (SPECT) did not find a difference in D2 receptor binding between A1 carriers and A2 homozygotes (Laruelle et al.,  ), but that study was later criticized for the combination of healthy participants and patients with schizophrenia in a sample and for the low resolution of the SPECT method (Ritchie and Noble,  ). Moreover, A1 carriers have been reported to exhibit increased striatal dopamine synthesis (Laakso et al.,  ), possibly reflecting reduced autoinhibitory signaling from presynaptic D2 receptors. In healthy human volunteers, DRD2 TaqIA has been shown to affect neural mechanisms of reward processing, compatible with the high levels of DRD2 expression in the striatum (Lee et al.,  ), and similar effects have been observed for other genetic variations that affect D2 receptor availability (Pecina et al.,  ). In light of the above-mentioned structural and functional connectivity between the PFC and the striatum and the regulation of dopamine release via autoinhibitory presynaptic D2 receptors, it seems plausible that DRD2 TaqIA also modulates PFC-dependent EFs. Indeed, DRD2 TaqIA has been demonstrated to affect task switching and working memory-related processes, the latter in epistatic interaction with COMT Val108/158Met genotype (Stelzel et al.,  ,  ; Garcia-Garcia et al.,  ). \n\nThe reported influences of DRD2 TaqIA on individual differences in prefrontal and striatal function are likely to be particularly pronounced when cognitive processes depend directly on fronto-striatal interactions. In line with this notion, motivation-based probabilistic learning or reversal learning have been shown to be affected by the polymorphism at the levels of both behavior and neural correlates, with A1 carriers being less successful in predicting negative outcomes and showing diminished recruitment of PFC and striatum during negative feedback processing and reversal learning (Klein et al.,  ; Jocham et al.,  ). \n\nThe tasks employed by Klein, Jocham and colleagues depend upon the direct interaction of the PFC and the striatum. Here we aimed to investigate effects of DRD2 TaqIA genotype on the modulation of primarily PFC-dependent inhibitory control and action monitoring by motivational processes, i.e., the anticipation of monetary gain or loss. We employed a modified flanker task during which, in a subset of the trials, participants could receive a reward, or avoid a punishment, or both. Recent evidence from animal studies suggests that the combination of appetitive and aversive reinforcement is associated with more pronounced improvement of learning performance than either one type of reinforcement alone (Ilango et al.,  ). Aiming to generalize this observation to human EFs, we also included a combined reward and loss condition in the task. Participants were genotyped for the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism and grouped into A1 carriers and non-carriers. In a first behavioral experiment, we hypothesized that behavioral responses to incongruent flanker trials would be faster, and possibly more accurate, in reward-associated or punishment-associated flanker trials, and that, in line with their increased risk for reward-related disorders like addiction (Noble,  ; Wang et al.,  ), A1 carriers would show more pronounced motivation-related modulation of the flanker trials. At a neural level, we hypothesized that A1 carriers and non-carriers would exhibit differential activation patterns in brain regions associated with conflict processing like the dACC and structures associated with motivational processing, like the striatum and the insula. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were recruited from a cohort of 615 young (behavioral study: age range 18\u201330 years, mean 23.65 \u00b1 2.86; fMRI study: age range 19\u201330 years, mean 23.00 \u00b1 2.51), healthy volunteers of a large-scale behavioral genetic study conducted at the Leibniz-Institute for Neurobiology, Magdeburg. Based on the assumption that a possible small effect of genes may not only require a large number of volunteers but also a strict control of non-genetic factors (Lee et al.,  ), participants were assessed for several exclusion criteria. All participants were right-handed according to self-report, not genetically related, and had obtained at least a university entrance diploma (  Abitur  ). Importantly, all participants had undergone routine clinical interview to exclude present or past neurological or psychiatric illness, alcohol, or drug abuse, use of centrally-acting medication, the presence of psychosis or bipolar disorder in a first-degree relative, and additionally, given the design of the experiment, frequent gambling. For both studies, the behavioral and the fMRI experiment, two participants were invited for piloting of the paradigm. Their data were not used for subsequent analyses. The final study sample consisted of 46 volunteers in the behavioral study and 32 participants in the fMRI study, with no overlap between the experiments. All participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and received financial compensation for participation. The work was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Magdeburg, Faculty of Medicine. \n\n\n### Genotyping \n  \nGenomic DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes using the GeneMole\u00ae automated system (Mole Genetics AS, Lysaker, Norway) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Genotyping was performed using PCR followed by allele-specific restriction analysis using previously described primers (Grandy et al.,  ). Briefly, the DNA fragment on Chr 11q23.1 containing the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism (NCBI accession number: rs1800497) was amplified using the primers DRD2-F: 5\u2032-CCGTCGACGGCTGGCCAAGTTGTCTA-3\u2032 and DRD2-B: 5\u2032-CCGTCGACCCTTCCTGAGTGTCATCA-3\u2032 and standard Taq polymerase (Qiagen and Fermentas). PCR products were digested with   TaqI   (Fermentas), yielding two fragments (130 + 180 bp) for the A2 allele or a single fragment (310 bp) for the A1 allele. DNA fragments were separated on a 2.5% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel and visualized under UV light. Because the COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism (NCBI accession number: rs4680) has previously been linked to individual differences in both PFC function and reward processing (Egan et al.,  ; Schmack et al.,  ; Wimber et al.,  ), participants were also genotyped for rs4680 using PCR and restriction with NlaIII (Schott et al.,  ; Wimber et al.,  ; details available upon request). \n\n\n### Behavioral study \n  \n#### Paradigm \n  \nWe employed a modified Eriksen flanker task (Eriksen and Eriksen,  ) with a motivation manipulation (Boksem et al.,  ). Participants were instructed to fixate a central target arrow and to indicate whether it was pointing to the left or to the right by pressing a button with the index or middle finger of the right hand. They had to ignore six distractor arrows with the same (congruent condition), the opposite (incongruent condition) or random (any three left and three right) orientation. Trials were grouped into four types of motivational categories. In reward trials (REW), volunteers were rewarded with 5 ct for fast and correct responses. Conversely, in punishment trials (PUN), they were punished for incorrect, slow or missing responses by the loss of 5 ct. These two conditions were complemented by neutral trials (NEU) in which responses were associated with neither gain nor loss and with trials in which fast and correct responses were rewarded and incorrect, slow or omitted responses were punished (combination trials\u2014COM). Each condition constituted 25% of the trials, and participants were notified about the upcoming trial type before each trial by presentation of neutral, positive, or negative cartoon face (neutral faces, smilies and frownies; see Figure  ). RTs were monitored throughout the course of the experiment. RTs exceeding the current mean RT by more than one standard deviation (SD) were considered too slow, and participants received a feedback (\u201cFaster!\u201d) whenever it was exceeded. Accuracy feedback was not delivered. \n  \n Schematic illustration of the experimental paradigm  . See Materials and Methods section for details. SSD, stop-signal delay; ITI, inter trial interval. \n  \nAs in a number of previous studies, the flanker task was combined with a stop-signal paradigm (Logan et al.,  ; Kr\u00e4mer et al.,  ; Boehler et al.,  ). Infrequently (on 20% of the trials), a circle instead of the target arrow was presented, signaling the participants to suppress their response. We used an adaptive short stop-signal delay (SSD) to yield an approximately equal number of signal-inhibit and signal-respond trials (Kr\u00e4mer et al.,  ; Boehler et al.,  ). The SSD was calculated online separate for each motivation condition. Participants were informed that rewards and punishments would never be delivered in stop trials, regardless of their inhibition performance. An example trial and the overview of the trial timing are displayed in Figure  . \n\nThe experiment consisted of four runs with 144 trials per run (including 24 stop trials). Each run was counterbalanced for experimental conditions and direction of the target arrow. The currently earned amount of money was displayed after each run. Participants were tested alone or in groups of no more than three persons. Before the experiment they were instructed using a standardized written instruction, followed by the opportunity to ask questions. Before the actual experiment, participants performed a training phase consisting of 42 trials (12 stop trials) during which an accuracy feedback was delivered. In this training the starting value of the RT limit was calculated. Data of the training phase were not analyzed further. Participants could earn up to 9 Euros (mean = 5.57 Euros \u00b1 1.53 Euros). \n\n\n#### Statistical analysis \n  \nTo examine the influence of the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism on flanker performance and its modulation by reward and punishment, flanker trials were analyzed with respect to the percentage of incorrect responses and the RTs of correct responses. Correct and incorrect reactions between 200 and 1000 ms after stimulus onset were analyzed. As a measure of interference processing the difference between congruent and incongruent trials (congruency effect) was calculated. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) for repeated measures were calculated for each dependent variable with the motivation condition as within-subject factor and DRD2 TaqIA genotype as between-subject factor. Degrees of freedom were corrected for non-sphericity using the Greenhouse-Geisser correction. \n\n\n\n### Functional MRI experiment \n  \n#### Paradigm \n  \nThe design of the task used in the behavioral study was simplified and adapted for the purposes of fMRI. As the random trials yielded accuracy rates and RTs that lay in between those of the congruent and the incongruent condition, we did not include random trials in the fMRI study, thereby increasing the number of congruent and incongruent trials contributing to the fMRI signal. Furthermore, the potential reward and punishment were increased from 5 to 20 ct, and participants received further 6 Euros to compensate for travel expenses, which they were told after the experiment. The trial timing of the events was the same as in the behavioral study, but the inter-trial interval was increased and jittered between 4 and 8 s, using a near-exponential jitter to optimize the estimation of the trial-specific BOLD responses (Hinrichs et al.,  ). In total, there were four runs with 96 trials each (16 stop trials). The training phase (36 trials including 6 stop trials) was performed outside the MR tomograph. Participants could earn up to 32 Euros (24.42 \u00b1 3.48 Euros; plus 6 Euros). \n\n\n#### Image acquisition \n  \nFour runs of 390 T2 -weighted echo-planar images (EPIs) per run were acquired on a GE Signa 1.5 T magnetic resonance system (General Electric Medical Systems) in an interleaved acquisition order (23 axial slices, odds first; voxel size = 3.13 mm \u00d7 3.13 mm \u00d7 4 mm + 1 mm gap;   TR   = 2 s;   TE   = 35 ms). Six EPIs were acquired before each run to allow for magnetic field stabilization and discarded from data analysis. Because proton-density (PD)-weighted MR images possess a good contrast for gray vs. white matter in the striatum and midbrain (D'Ardenne et al.,  ; Schott et al.,  ), a co-planar PD-weighted MR image was acquired and used for improved spatial normalization. \n\n\n#### Data processing and analysis \n  \nData analysis was carried out using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, London, UK). EPIs were corrected for acquisition delay and head motion. The co-planar PD-weighted image was coregistered to the mean image obtained from motion correction and used to determine normalization parameters for spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotactic coordinate system (voxel size = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm). Data were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8 mm, and a high-pass filter with a cut-off of 128 s was applied to the data. \n\nStatistical analysis was performed using a two-stage mixed effects model. At the first stage, the hemodynamic response was modeled by convolving a delta function at stimulus onset with a canonical HRF (Friston et al.,  ). The resulting time courses were downsampled to the temporal resolution of fMRI scanning (1/  TR   = 0.5 Hz) to form covariates of a general linear model (GLM). The model included separate covariates for each condition of interest (correct responses in the conditions NEU-congruent, NEU-incongruent, REW-congruent, REW-incongruent, PUN-congruent, PUN-incongruent, COM-congruent, and COM-incongruent). The model included also covariates of no interest, namely incorrect responses, a feedback regressor, four stop-trial regressors for each motivation condition, the instruction screen, and the six rigid-body movement parameters determined from motion correction, plus a single constant representing the mean over scans. Model estimation was performed using a restricted maximum likelihood fit. \n\nAt the second stage of the model, the conditions of interest separated by genotype were submitted to second level random effect analyses. Specifically, the within-subject factors congruency and motivation were submitted to a full-factorial ANOVA, with genotype as between-subject factor. Because of our strong   a priori   hypotheses regarding brain regions previously implicated in interference processing and motivation, several regions of interest (ROIs) were defined. The ROI of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was generated using the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) of the superior and middle frontal gyrus implemented in the WFU Pickatlas (Wake Forest University), and ROIs of the ACC, the anterior insula and striatum were generated using a previously described literature-based probabilistic approach (Schubert et al.,  ; Zweynert et al.,  ; see Figures  \u2013 ). The   a priori   statistical threshold was set to   p   = 0.05 family wise error (FWE)-corrected for all comparisons, with the correction applied to ROI volumes for regions with   a priori   hypotheses, and an additional Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for the number of ROIs (  n   = 8). Coordinates are given in MNI space. To further verify reliability of genetically driven between-group differences and reduce the influence of outliers, confidence intervals were estimated for the local maxima using bootstrap resampling and the percentile-t method (Schott et al.,  ; Wimber et al.,  ). For visualization purposes, activations were superimposed onto the MNI template image provided by MRIcron ( ). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Genotyping \n  \nAmong the 615 participants in the original cohort who were genotyped for the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism, we identified 22 A1 homozygotes, 210 heterozygotes, and 383 A2 homozygotes. The distribution was at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium [\u03c7  = 1.08,   p   = 0.298]. Regarding the COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism, the sample included 164 Met homozygotes, 322 heterozygotes, and 129 Val homozygotes, and HWE was not violated [\u03c7  = 1.57,   p   = 0.210]. \n\n\n### Behavioral results \n  \nIn the behavioral study the data of 46 young, healthy participants were analyzed (27 women, 19 men). The cohort consisted of one A1 homozygote, 23 heterozygotes and 22 A2 homozygotes. Thirty-two participants took part in the fMRI study (19 women, 13 men), including 15 heterozygote A1 carriers and 17 A2 homozygotes. Given the low number of A1 homozygous subjects (  n   = 1), A1 carriers (A1+: A1/A1 and A1/A2) were grouped together for all subsequent analyses. The groups A1+ and A1\u2212 (A2/A2) did not differ in gender distribution, mean age or in percentage of smokers. Because the COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism (rs4680) has previously been demonstrated to affect PFC function and reward processing, participants were also genotyped for this SNP, and the distribution of Val and Met alleles did not differ significantly between groups. For detailed demographic information see Table  . Error rates and RTs across the different conditions are displayed in Table  , separated by DRD2 TaqIA genotype. \n  \n Demographic data  . \n  \nGender distribution, age (average \u00b1 SD), number of smokers and nonsmokers and COMT Val108/158Met occurrence (mm, met homozygotes; vm, val/met heterozygotes; mm, met homozygotes) of the participants. \n    \n Descriptive statistics of the behavioral data  . \n  \nMean reaction times (RT) of correct responses and error rates \u00b1 standard deviations (SD) are shown. NEU, condition with no reward or punishment; REW, rewarded condition; PUN, punished condition; COM, condition with reward and punishment. \n  \n#### Effects of congruency and motivation \n  \nOverall, participants responded fast and accurately. To test for genotype-related and task-related differences in behavioral performance, we computed ANOVAs for repeated measures with congruency and motivation as within-subject factors and genotype as between-subject factor. Replicating previous results (Botvinick et al.,  ; Casey et al.,  ; Botvinick et al.,  ; Richter et al.,  ; Bugg and Crump,  ), we observed a main effect of flanker condition with higher error rates and slower RTs in the incongruent as compared to the congruent condition in both the behavioral [main effect of congruency: RT:   F   = 360.26,   p   < 0.001; error rate:   F   = 66.00;   p   < 0.001] and the fMRI experiment [RT:   F   = 387.10,   p   < 0.001; error rate:   F   = 26.73,   p   < 0.001]. In the behavioral study, error rates and RTs in the random trials lay in between those of the congruent and the incongruent trials, suggesting that the congruency effect depended on the number of distractors (Table  ). Motivational salience (i.e., the presence of reward, punishment, or both) was associated with shorter RTs in all motivated trials compared to the NEU in both the behavioral [main effect of motivation:   F   = 36.18,   p   < 0.001] and the fMRI experiment [  F   = 11.00,   p   < 0.001], while the error rates did not differ significantly across the different motivation conditions (all   p   > 0.074). In the behavioral study, the REW condition elicited the shortest RTs [REW vs. PUN:   t   = \u22123.98,   p   < 0.001; REW vs. COM:   t   = \u22124.12,   p   < 0.001; PUN vs. COM:   t   = \u22120.07,   p   = 0.947]. \n\n\n#### Genotype-related modulation of cognition-motivation interaction \n  \nAcross flanker and motivation conditions there was no genotype-related difference in overall RTs [  Behavioral experiment:   A1 carriers: 410 \u00b1 48 ms, A2/A2: 419 \u00b1 55 ms;   t   = \u22120.58,   p   = 0.567;   fMRI experiment:   A1 carriers: 438 \u00b1 38 ms, A2/A2: 440 \u00b1 43 ms;   t   = \u22120.12,   p   = 0.905], suggesting that there were no genotype-related differences in sensorimotor function. \n\nTo specifically test for effects of genotype on interference processing and its modulation by motivational salience, we computed the behavioral congruency effects, i.e., the differences of error rates and RTs between incongruent and congruent trials, separated by motivation conditions. These values were the dependent variables in ANOVAs for repeated measures with motivation condition (NEU vs. REW vs. PUN vs. COM) as within-subject factor with four levels, and DRD2 TaqIA genotype (A1+ vs. A2/A2) as between-subject factor with two levels. The analysis of error rates revealed no significant effects of either factors motivation or genotype (all   p   > 0.120), but in the analysis of congruency-related RT differences, a significant motivation by genotype interaction was observed in the behavioral experiment [  F   = 3.07,   p   = 0.039]. While this interaction effect was not significant in the (smaller) cohort of the fMRI experiment, it remained significant when combining the data of both experiments [  F   = 2.96,   p   = 0.039; because of the differences in experimental design, the experiment\u2014behavioral vs. fMRI\u2014was included as a covariate of no interest in this ANOVA]. To explore the pattern underlying this interaction, we computed   post-hoc   paired   T  -tests on the RT congruency effects in the different motivation conditions, separated by DRD2 TaqIA genotype. Results of the   post-hoc   comparisons are displayed in Table   (both studies combined) and in Table   (both studies separately; note that   post-hoc   comparisons from the fMRI experiment are for illustrative purpose only, given the lack of an interaction effect in the ANOVA). In summary, the results of the   post-hoc   tests, albeit exploratory, suggest that A1 homozygotes showed a reduced congruency effect primarily in the rewarded condition (significant in the behavioral study only, see Table  ) and nominally benefitted from all motivated conditions, whereas A2 homozygotes showed smaller congruency-related RT differences in the combined condition relative to the conditions with reward or punishment alone (Figure  , Tables  ,  ). \n  \n Behavioral data (  t  -statistics)  . \n  \nResults of post-hoc paired T-tests testing for effects of the motivation conditions on the congruency effect of reaction times, separated by genotype group and collapsed across experiments. All p-values are one-tailed, except for the REW vs. PUN contrast for which we had no directed hypothesis. NEU, neutral condition; REW, reward condition; PUN, punishment condition; COM, combined reward and punishment condition. \n    \n Behavioral congruency effect  . Plots depict the difference between incongruent and congruent RTs for each motivation condition (\u00b1 standard errors). Data from both experiments (behavioral and fMRI) are combined. Higher values indicate stronger distractor interference. The observed pattern suggests that A1 carries showed a small to moderate reduction of the RT difference (incongruent vs. congruent) in all motivated trials, particularly in the reward condition, whereas the RT difference reduction in A2 carriers was largely restricted to the combined condition [genotype by motivation interaction:   F   = 2.96;   p   = 0.039]. NEU, neutral condition; REW, reward condition; PUN, punishment condition; COM, combined reward and punishment condition. \n  \n\n\n### Functional MRI results \n  \nAll comparisons were based on a full-factorial ANOVA model with congruency (congruent vs. incongruent), motivation (NEU vs. REW vs. PUN vs. COM), and genotype (A1+ vs. A2/A2) as factors. An overview of the relevant comparisons in the regions of interest (dACC, DLPFC, insula, striatum) is displayed in Table  . \n  \n Peak activation foci in the ROI analyses  . \n  \nClusters with peak activation p < 0.05, FWE-corrected for ROIs volume with their cluster extent at p < 0.005, uncorrected. Coordinates are given in MNI space (unit mm). R, right; L, left; \n  \n#### Effects of congruency and motivation \n  \nIn line with previous studies (Ridderinkhof et al.,  ; Ullsperger and Von Cramon,  ), a one-tailed   T  -test comparing BOLD responses of incongruent and congruent trials revealed increased activity in distributed regions of the DLPFC and in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; see Figure  , Table  ). \n  \n Neural correlates of congruency and motivation. (A)   Effect of congruency. Incongruent trials elicited higher activity in dACC relative to congruent trials. Bar plots depict the corresponding parameter estimates of the parametric regressors at the ACC peak coordinate of the contrast incongruent vs. congruent trials are shown, separated by motivation conditions (\u00b1 standard errors).   (B)   Neural correlates of motivational salience. Brain regions exhibiting motivation-related activation differences include the striatum, the anterior insula, and the ACC. All activation maps are superimposed on the MNI template brain provided by MRIcron. Contrasts were significant at   p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected. Coordinates are in MNI space. NEU, neutral condition; REW, reward condition; PUN, punishment condition; COM, combined reward and punishment condition. \n  \nThe effect of motivational salience was tested by means of comparing the three motivated conditions to the neutral condition, using a one-tailed   T  -test. Irrespective of flanker condition and genotype, motivation-associated trials elicited higher BOLD responses in the bilateral striatum (Knutson et al.,  ; Wittmann et al.,  ) as well as in the ACC, the anterior insula, and in the bilateral lingual gyri when compared to neutral flanker (see Figure  , left panel). The anticipation of (avoidable) monetary punishment was associated with a similar pattern of brain activity increases, albeit of lower magnitude (Figure  , middle panel). Activations in the combined reward and punishment trials were largely comparable to those in the rewarded trials (Figure  , right panel). \n\nA trend for a genotype-independent interaction of congruency and motivation was observed in our ROI of the DLPFC [  x  ,   y  ,   z   = \u221218, 56, 16;   F   = 8.37;   p   = 0.036, FWE-corrected for ROI volume, but not significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple ROIs] where activation related to the incongruent flanker condition was reduced in the motivated trials relative to NEU (Figure  ). Further localization of the activation maximum using the BA map provided by MRIcron revealed that the cluster was located in the lateral portion of Brodmann area (BA) 10, bordering BA 46. \n  \n Congruency by motivation interaction in the PFC  . A genotype-independent interaction of congruency and motivation was observed in the PFC (BA 10, bordering BA 46) where activation related to the incongruent versus congruent flanker condition was reduced in the motivated relative to neutral trials. This interaction effect was significant at   p   < 0.05, small-volume FWE-corrected for ROI volume. Activations are superimposed on the MNI template brain provided by MRIcron.

Compared to A2 homozygotes, A1 carriers exhibited increased activation of the left anterior insula [main effect of genotype:   x  ,   y  ,   z   = \u221230, 20, \u22128;   F   = 17.23;   p   = 0.002, FWE-corrected for ROI volume] (Figure  ). To verify the reliability of the between-group differences, confidence intervals were estimated for the two genotype groups using bootstrap resampling and the percentile-t method (Schott et al.,  ). Between-group differences were reliable as indicated by non-overlapping 95 per cent confidence intervals in three motivated conditions (congruent REW, incongruent PUN, incongruent COM), but the confidence intervals in the neutral conditions were largely overlapping between genotype groups, raising the possibility that the genotype-related differences might be largely driven by the motivated conditions. To further explore this possibility, we performed an exploratory   post-hoc   masking analysis in which the main effect of genotype was inclusively masked with the genotype by motivation interaction contrast (thresholded at   p   < 0.05, uncorrected). The genotype-related activation difference in the left insula remained significant at   p   < 0.05, corrected for ROI volume, in this masking analysis. \n  \n Genotype-dependent modulation of insula activity  . A1 carriers exhibited increased activation of the anterior insula, when compared to A1- in the conditions with potential reward and punishment. This main effect of genotype was significant at   p   < 0.05, small-volume FWE-corrected for ROI volume. Activations are superimposed on the MNI template brain provided by MRIcron. Coordinates are in MNI space. Bar plots depict parameter estimates at the peak coordinate separated by genotypes and motivation conditions. Error bars depict standard errors of the mean. NEU, neutral condition; REW, reward condition; PUN, punishment condition; COM, combined reward and punishment condition. \n  \nIn addition to the main effect of genotype in the anterior insula, we observed a three-way interaction (congruency \u00d7 motivation \u00d7 genotype) in the ACC [  x  ,   y  ,   z   = 9, 38, 28;   F   = 8.44;   p   = 0.006, FWE-corrected for ROI volume; see Figure  , top].   Post-hoc   two-sample   T  -tests over the contrasts of parameter estimates (incongruent vs. congruent) at the peak voxel in the right ACC revealed that A2 homozygotes showed higher activation in the trials with potential reward when compared to A1 carriers [ACC:   t   = \u22122.87;   p   = 0.007] while A1 carriers as compared to A2 homozygotes exhibited increased activation of the right ACC in the combined reward and punishment condition [  t   = 3.12;   p   = 0.004]. We also observed a trend for a three-way interaction in the right striatum [  x  ,   y  ,   z   = 21, \u22121, \u22122;   F   = 6.02;   p   = 0.050, FWE-corrected for ROI volume; see Figure  , bottom], but this did not survive Bonferroni correction for multiple ROIs. \n  \n Interaction of genotype, congruency, and motivation  . Complex genotype-dependent modulation of interference processing was observed in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum. The three-way interaction of congruency \u00d7 motivation \u00d7 genotype is displayed, which was significant for the ACC at   p   < 0.05, small-volume FWE-corrected for ROI volumes. Activations are superimposed on the MNI template brain provided by MRIcron. Coordinates are in MNI space. Bar plots depict contrasts of parameter estimates at the peak coordinate separated by genotypes and motivation conditions.

Specifically Val homozygotes showed relatively higher lateral PFC activation in incongruent trials relative to Met carriers. There were, however, no further interaction effects between COMT genotype and motivational salience. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we investigated the influences of the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism on the modulation of interference processing by reward and punishment. Motivational salience, i.e., the possibility to obtain a reward, to avoid a punishment, or both, was associated with shorter RTs in both the incongruent and congruent flanker condition. While the congruency-related RT difference did not differ between motivation conditions, functional MRI revealed a reduced congruency effect in the DLPFC during motivated trials, possibly reflecting increased processing efficiency. Moreover, we observed a complex interaction effect of motivation and genotype on the congruency-related RT differences in the behavioral experiment. This effect was not significant in the behavioral data of the fMRI experiment, but could still be observed when combining both datasets. Nominally, carriers of the less common DRD2 TaqIA A1 allele (A1+) with presumably lower D2 receptor density in striatum showed an, at least trendwise, improvement of interference processing in all motivated conditions (most strongly in the rewarded condition), whereas A2 carriers exhibited pronounced improvement during combined anticipation of reward or punishment as compared to either reward or punishment alone. At a neural level, genotype-related activation differences were observed in the anterior insula where A1 carriers showed increased task-related activation, and in the anterior cingulate, where a complex task by genotype interaction was observed. \n\n### Effects of motivation on flanker performance and neural correlates \n  \nThe motivation to obtain a reward or to avoid a loss was associated with shorter RTs in both, congruent and incongruent trials, while error rates did not show a significant modulation by motivational salience. Because of the dichotomous nature of accuracy rates and the considerable individual variability, the power to detect significant within- or between-group differences is limited, and RTs with their continuous distribution might be a more sensitive measure of motivation-related enhancement of cognitive processing, reflecting enhanced vigilance in motivated trials (Hardin et al.,  ). One might argue, however, that shorter RTs, when accompanied by reduced accuracy, might reflect impulsive responding rather than improved performance (Caldu et al.,  ). In the present study, error rates were nominally higher in the reward-related and punishment-related trials, but not in the combined condition. Given the overall low error rates and high variability, it is not possible to determine whether the RT decrease in motivated trials observed here might be to some degree related to impulsive responding. Reward anticipation has been demonstrated to promote responding, but to impair response inhibition in a probabilistic go/no-go task, but no such pattern has been observed for the anticipation of losses (Guitart-Masip et al.,  ). During interference processing in a Stroop task, on the other hand, accuracy was actually improved for rewarded trials (Krebs et al.,  ). Future studies employing more sensitive measures of accuracy are therefore needed to determine whether reward-related reductions of response times during performance of complex tasks reflects actual improvement of performance vs. a speed-accuracy tradeoff. \n\nDespite the lack of a specific modulation of the RT congruency effect by motivation, at a neural level, we observed a congruency by motivation interaction in the PFC where motivational conditions were associated with reduced activation during processing of incongruent relative to congruent flanker trials. This prefrontal fMRI response reduction is well in line with previous studies suggesting that dopamine modulates processing efficiency in the PFC. Decreased PFC activation accompanied by comparable or even superior behavioral performance has previously been suggested to reflect higher processing efficiency, which has been reported in carriers of the (low-activity) COMT 158Met allele (Egan et al.,  ; Meyer-Lindenberg and Weinberger,  ; Schott et al.,  ; Caldu et al.,  ) and in Parkinson's disease patients who received L-dopa (Mattay et al.,  ). Most studies reporting dopaminergic modulation of processing efficiency focused on the DLPFC. The activation cluster showing a congruency by motivation interaction in our study was located in the lateral portion of BA 10, in close proximity to BA 46. According to a common definition, BA 9 and 46 are referred to as DLPFC (Cieslik et al.,  ), but there is considerable heterogeneity in the literature regarding the precise delineation of the DLPFC, with several authors referring to at least parts of BA 8, 10, and 45 belonging to the DLPFC (Sarazin et al.,  ; Nitschke et al.,  ; Leung and Cai,  ), while others have listed BA 46 as part of the ventrolateral PFC (Arango et al.,  ).   In vivo   segmentation of PFC subregions is also somewhat problematic, since most definitions are based on   post mortem   cytoarchitectonic mapping. The precise localization of the prefrontal cluster showing a congruency by motivation interaction to a subregion within the PFC remains thus somewhat speculative. It should be noted, though that its presumed position at the intersection of the DLPFC and the frontopolar cortex is in line with a previous study demonstrating joint deactivation of BA 10 during working memory and reward processing (Pochon et al.,  ) and with recent evidence for pronounced functional connectivity between the anterior portion of the DLPFC and the dACC (Cieslik et al.,  ). \n\nGiven the lack of a specific behavioral effect of motivation on the RT congruency effect, our results do not allow us to directly infer that the reduced overall RTs in motivated conditions are the result of increased prefrontal processing efficiency. On the other hand, more generally speaking, the co-occurrence of reduced RTs and decreased DLPFC activation to incongruent trials is at least indicative for a relationship between motivational processes, which are known to elicit dopamine release (Koepp et al.,  ; Schott et al.,  ) and PFC-dependent cognitive processing. In line with this notion, an exploratory analysis within the present study suggested that the COMT 158Val allele, which has been linked to lower prefrontal dopamine availability, was associated with increased lateral PFC activation to incongruent flanker trials. \n\nSeveral previous studies have investigated the influence of reward and punishment on cognitive tasks, but little is thus far known about their combined effects. Recent animal studies on discrimination learning of frequency-modulated (FM) tones (Ilango et al.,  ) suggest that a combination of both reward and punishment might be associated with particularly strong performance enhancement. In a shuttle box paradigm, Mongolian gerbils were motivated by either appetitive reinforcement (brain stimulation reward) or by aversive reinforcement (avoidance of an electrical footshock), or by a combination of both. Compared to either reinforcement condition alone, the combination of both potentiated speed of acquisition and maximum performance while reducing later extinction. In the study by Ilango and colleagues, reward and punishment were qualitatively distinct (brain stimulation reward vs. foot shock), whereas in our study, the difference between the reward conditions was rather a quantitative one (monetary gain vs. loss). Therefore, the COM condition could to some extent be considered as a reward condition, although it would elicit larger prediction errors than the REW condition. On the other hand, the behavioral pattern observed here speaks against a merely quantitative difference. Namely, while the overall RT reduction across conditions was at least nominally less pronounced in the COM relative to the REW and PUN conditions, the COM condition was the one to show the strongest trend of a motivation-related reduction of the RT congruency effect (for a further interaction with DRD2 genotype, see below). One possible reason for this could be that participants might have slowed down their responses to some extent in the combination condition, in order to maximize accuracy. Indeed, accuracy was nominally higher in the COM condition as compared to the REW and PUN conditions, but these differences were not significant, possibly due to lack of statistical power given the overall high accuracy. Further experiments are needed to clarify whether the combination of both appetitive and aversive reinforcement indeed leads to a shift from speed to accuracy. As a potential limitation, it should also be noted that the size of the cue was larger in the combined condition (Figure  ), which could have distracted the participants from fixation of the target arrow after the cue (  Note:   Pilot data from a recent follow-up experiment with cues of equal size does not support the latter explanation). \n\n\n### Genetic variability of D2 receptor availability interacts with motivational modulation of cognitive performance \n  \nDRD2 TaqIA genotype did not affect overall processing speed, but the congruency-related RT differences, suggesting that its effects cannot be explained by genotype-related differences in sensorimotor processing. Group-specific analysis of the congruency-related RT differences in each motivation condition revealed that A1 carriers exhibited improved interference processing in motivated, particularly rewarded trials (albeit significantly so only in the behavioral experiment), whereas the A2 homozygotes benefitted primarily from the combined reward and punishment condition. DRD2 TaqIA has been extensively investigated in neuropsychiatric disorders with presumed dopaminergic dysfunction, and the A1 allele has been associated with increased risk for disorders like substance abuse and pathological gambling or obesity, whereas the A2 allele has been implicated in the genetic risk for schizophrenia (Comings et al.,  ; Noble,  ; Dubertret et al.,  ; Klein et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). Moreover, studies in healthy humans have suggested a role of the DRD2 TaqIA A1 variant in approach-related personality traits (Noble et al.,  ; Reuter et al.,  ; Lee et al.,  ; Smillie et al.,  ). While our finding that A1 carriers exhibit a reduction of the congruency-related RT difference in rewarded trials (and nominally in all motivated conditions) is compatible with the notion that A1 carriers might be more sensitive to rewards and losses, the observation that A2 carriers specifically benefitted from the combined condition was unexpected. The A2 allele has been linked to higher D2 receptor expression in the striatum (see, for example, Ritchie and Noble,  ). Studies in transgenic mice have shown that even transient overexpression of D2 receptors in the striatum leads to persistent alterations of PFC-dependent cognitive functions, particularly working memory and cognitive flexibility (Kellendonk et al.,  ), and electrophysiological investigations further suggest that these alterations might be related to reduced inhibitory neurotransmission and lower prefrontal dopamine sensitivity (Li et al.,  ). Because levels of D2 receptor overexpression are higher than the described genotype-related D2 receptor expression differences in humans, inferences from these transgenic animal studies to effects of DRD2 TaqIA genotype effects must be considered tentative. If prefrontal dopamine sensitivity was reduced in A2 homozygotes, this might indeed provide a potential explanation for our behavioral results, namely, while reward or punishment alone might be insufficient to raise prefrontal dopamine availability to a level that allows improved interference processing, the combined condition might be associated with a further increase of prefrontal dopamine that might in turn enable a performance advantage in the A2 homozygotes. In A1 carriers, on the other hand, the congruency-related RT difference was at least nominally larger in the combined condition relative to either reward or punishment alone and not significantly different from the neutral condition. If the combined condition was indeed associated with higher prefrontal dopamine release than either reward or punishment alone, the resulting dopamine levels in A1 carriers might be too high for optimal performance, compatible with the model of an inverse U-shaped function of prefrontal dopamine (Meyer-Lindenberg and Weinberger,  ). \n\nAt a neural level, a complex task by genotype interaction was observed in the dACC (Figure  , top). Compared to A2 homozygotes, A1 carriers exhibited relatively reduced dACC activation to incongruent vs. congruent flanker trials in the REW condition, while this pattern reversed in the COM condition, meaning that both groups exhibited lower dACC activation in the condition in which they showed their most pronounced reduction of the congruency-related RT difference. In the DLPFC, lower activation accompanied by comparable or superior performance has been suggested to reflect higher processing efficiency (Meyer-Lindenberg and Weinberger,  ; see also above), and at least one study suggests that a similar pattern can be observed in the dACC during performance of attention tasks similar to the flanker task (Blasi et al.,  ). One limitation here is the lack of a full replication of the behavioral pattern in the fMRI cohort alone (see Table  ). It should be noted, though that the sample size of the fMRI experiment was smaller than that of the behavioral experiment and therefore possibly underpowered for detection of genotype-related differences in behavior. Brain activity phenotypes have been suggested to be more directly related to the molecular and cellular effects of genetic variations and might thus be more readily detectable in smaller samples (Mier et al.,  ). Therefore, we tentatively suggest that the activation pattern in the dACC might to some extent mirror the behavioral pattern, although caution is warranted. This does, on the other hand, not explain why there was no clear genotype-related ACC activation difference in the PUN condition. One explanation for this observation could be that aversive reinforcement might be more likely to engage other neuromodulatory systems, like the serotonergic system (Daw et al.,  ) in addition to the dopaminergic system, which might reduce the overall influence of genetically mediated differences in dopaminergic neurotransmission during PUN trials. \n\nIn addition to the interaction effect in the dACC, genotype-related differences in neural activity patterns included increased activation of the anterior insula in A1 carriers, and   post-hoc   analyses employing confidence interval estimation and masking further suggested that this genotype-related activation difference was largely attributable to the motivated trials. The insula has been commonly found to co-activate with the striatum during reward prediction errors and reward anticipation (for a review, see Diekhof et al.,  ), although some studies argue that insula-dependent processing of cues and prediction errors is particularly critical for the prediction of losses (Palminteri et al.,  ; Metereau and Dreher,  ) and negative choices (Knutson et al.,  ). Previous studies have demonstrated extensive dopaminergic innervation of the insula (Seamans and Yang,  ), and the insula also shows substantial structural and functional connectivity with the striatum (de Wit et al.,  ; Palminteri et al.,  ; Ye et al.,  ). Expression of D2 receptors, though, is sparse in the insula where the D1 receptor is the predominant dopamine receptor subtype (Hurd et al.,  ). Considering the high levels of D2 receptor expression in the striatum relative to cortical structures, including the insula, it seems somewhat counterintuitive why a genotype-dependent modulation of motivational processing was observed in the insula rather than the striatum where a more complex interaction of task, genotype, and motivation was observed instead. One possible explanation would be that insula activity during motivational processing might be affected by reduced presynaptic D2 autoreceptor density in A1 carriers. In line with this notion, Laakso et al. ( ) observed higher striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in A1 carriers, which they attributed to reduced D2-mediated autoinhibition of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. Moreover, pharmacological stimulation of D2-type receptors by pramipexole during reward anticipation has been shown to elicit increased activation of the ventral striatum during reward anticipation, which is accompanied by increased functional connectivity between the striatum and the insula (Ye et al.,  ). We tentatively suggest that the parallel reduction of postsynaptic D2 receptors and increase release of dopamine from presynaptic sites in A1 carriers might result in increased dopaminergic action outside the striatum, as also proposed by Stelzel et al. ( ), who suggested that adaptively increased dopamine signaling in A1 carriers might evoke a more pronounced gating signal that facilitates PFC-dependent updating processes during task switching. \n\nIt must be seen as a limitation of our study that our results do not allow to make a direct connection between the increased motivation-related insula activity in A1 carriers, which could be observed across motivated conditions, including COM trials, and the complex behavioral pattern in which the different motivation conditions showed non-linear genotype-related differences. Constituting a key structure of the human salience network (Cauda et al.,  ), the anterior insula has been implicated in focal attentional processes as well as in goal-directed behavior (Dosenbach et al.,  ; Nelson et al.,  ), we therefore tentatively suggest that the increased anterior insula activation in the A1 carriers might reflect an increased recruitment of stimulus-responsive attentional resources in the motivated trials, although the relationship between the increased insula activation and the observed behavioral pattern remains, as of now, subject to speculation and needs to be addressed by future studies. \n\n\n### Potential molecular mechnanisms underlying the effects of DRD2/ANKK1 TaqIa genotype \n  \nAlthough the TaqIA polymorphism was initially identified during the localization of the DRD2 gene to human chromosome 11q22-23 (Grandy et al.,  ), it has subsequently been pointed out that the SNP is in fact located 10 kb downstream of the DRD2 termination codon on 11q23.1, within coding region of the adjacent ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (ANKK1) gene (Dubertret et al.,  ; Neville et al.,  ). Subsequent genetic association studies have since suggested that other genetic variations of ANKK1 might also be associated with addiction disorders (for a review see Ponce et al.,  ). As the DRD2 and ANKK1 gene are closely linked (Neville et al.,  ; Ponce et al.,  ), it has been suggested that genetic variations in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with TaqIA might explain the observed relationship between the SNP and alterations of human dopaminergic neurotransmission. Indeed the DRD2/ANKK1-TaqIA polymorphism is in LD with several polymorphisms on the DRD2 gene (Duan et al.,  ; Ritchie and Noble,  ; Fossella et al.,  ). Particularly the C957T polymorphism (rs6277) has received considerable attention as it is in LD with TaqIA and affects stability of the DRD2 mRNA (Duan et al.,  ). However, evidence from   in vivo   D2 receptor binding studies is not conclusive and also in apparent conflict with the   in vitro   data (Hirvonen et al.,  , see also erratum by Hirvonen et al.,  ,  , ). On the other hand, the TaqIA polymorphism, despite being located on the ANKK1 gene, has been repeatedly associated with reduced striatal D2 receptor density in A1 carriers as evident from three   post mortem   studies (Noble et al.,  ; Thompson et al.,  ; Ritchie and Noble,  ) and two out of three conducted   in vivo   binding studies (Pohjalainen et al.,  ; Laruelle et al.,  ; Jonsson et al.,  ). Moreover, the A1 allele has been associated with increased striatal dopamine synthesis, presumably due to reduced expression of presynaptic autoinhibitory D2 receptors, whereas no association was found between C957T and dopamine synthesis capacity (Laakso et al.,  ). In line with these findings, Stelzel et al. ( ) reported a generally increased striatal BOLD signal in A1 carriers. As striatal BOLD signal has been shown to correlate with dopamine release (Schott et al.,  ), this increased striatal activation might be related to higher presynaptic dopaminergic activity in A1 carriers. \n\nIn light of the converging evidence that TaqIA seems to be most reliably associated with lower D2 receptor density further investigations directed at the interaction of DRD2 and ANKK1 is warranted. The predicted ANKK1 protein is an unselective serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase with 11 ankyrin repeats located at the C-terminal end. TaqIA is located in exon 9 of the ANKK1 gene and leads to a glutamate to lysine substitution in the 11th ankyrin repeat. While a direct interaction of DRD2 and ANKK1 has not yet been confirmed, the ontogenetic pattern of ANKK1 expression strongly resembles that of DRD2 and shows upregulation after D2 receptor stimulation by apomorphine (Hoenicka et al.,  ). Strikingly, a genetic variation in close LD with TaqIA, the ANKK1 Ala239Thr polymorphism differentially modulates constitutive and apomorphine-induced ANKK1 expression   in vitro   (Garrido et al.,  ). While D2 receptor-dependent regulation of ANKK1 expression is therefore likely, future research is required to establish whether ANKK1 in turn can also regulate DRD2 expression. \n\n\n### Limitations and directions for future research \n  \nA key limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size, particularly with respect to the behavioral results that reached significance in the behavioral study alone and in the combined cohort, but not in the fMRI experiment alone. Therefore, relating the behavioral and fMRI data to each directly remains to some extent speculative. Another limitation is that, while our results are generally in line with previous studies that have demonstrated effects of DRD2 TaqIA genotype on motivational processes and EFs, one must consider that genetic variations within the dopaminergic system do not exert their effects in isolation. Regarding the flanker task, a human electrophysiological study could demonstrate relatively general effects of a DRD4 genetic variation on error processing, with a further modulation by COMT genotype specifically during stop-signal errors. While, in the present study, we could replicate previous observations of (inefficient) increased prefrontal activation in Val homozygotes (Meyer-Lindenberg et al.,  ), the sample size did not allow us to systematically investigate the combined effects of COMT and DRD2 genetic variations. Future studies should thus further consider the possibility of both additive (Bertolino et al.,  ) and non-linear (Yacubian et al.,  ) gene-gene interactions within the dopaminergic system on human cognitive and motivational processing. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nTaken together our results provide further evidence for a modulation of PFC-dependent EFs by motivational salience. Behaviorally, motivation was associated with overall RT reduction across flanker conditions. At a neural level, we observed a motivation-related reduction of DLPFC activation specifically during the incongruent vs. congruent flanker trials, suggesting that motivational salience might result in higher processing efficiency. A genetic variation that has previously been linked to striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability did not affect overall performance as indexed by RTs, but instead, showed a complex interaction with motivation on interference effects. A1 carriers with presumably lower D2 expression showed (at least nominally) improved interference processing during rewarded trials, while A2 homozygotes primarily benefitted from the combination of appetitive and aversive reinforcement. At a neural level, a compatible pattern was observed in a complex genotype by task interaction in the dACC. Additionally, A1 carriers showed an increased neural response of the anterior insula, an effect mostly driven by motivationally salient stimuli. These findings are in line with previous research linking prefrontal dopamine to performance of EFs, possibly following an inverse U-shaped function. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tA1+\tA1\u2212\tUnnamed: 3\nBEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENT\tBEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENT\tBEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENT\tBEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENT\nWomen/Men\t14/10\t13/9\t\u03c72 < 0.01; p = 0.958\nMean age\t24.2 \u00b1 2.9\t23.1 \u00b1 2.7\tt(44) = 1.28; p = 0.206\nSmokers/Nonsmokers\t8/16\t6/16\t\u03c72 = 0.20; p = 0.655\nCOMT mm/vm/vv\t10/9/5\t6/12/4\t\u03c72 = 1.46; p = 0.483\nfMRI EXPERIMENT\tfMRI EXPERIMENT\tfMRI EXPERIMENT\tfMRI EXPERIMENT\nWomen/Men\t10/5\t9/8\t\u03c72 = 0.62; p = 0.430\nMean age\t22.3 \u00b1 1.9\t23.6 \u00b1 2.9\tt(30) = \u22121.43; p = 0.162\nSmokers/Nonsmokers\t3/12\t6/11\t\u03c72 = 0.92; p = 0.337\nCOMT mm/vm/vv\t3/8/4\t5/7/5\t\u03c72 = 0.56; p = 0.758\n### Caption\nDemographic data.\n### Footer\nGender distribution, age (average \u00b1 SD), number of smokers and nonsmokers and COMT Val108/158Met occurrence (mm, met homozygotes; vm, val/met heterozygotes; mm, met homozygotes) of the participants.\n\n\n## ID: T2\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tA1+\tA1+\tA1\u2212\tA1\u2212\tUnnamed: 5_level_0\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tUnnamed: 1_level_1\tRT [ms]\tError rate [%]\tRT [ms]\tError rate [%]\nBEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENT\tBEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENT\tBEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENT\tBEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENT\tBEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENT\tBEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENT\nAll trials\t\t410 \u00b1 48\t6.8 \u00b1 5.4\t419 \u00b1 55\t7.1 \u00b1 5.3\nCongruent trials\tNEU\t378 \u00b1 44\t0.5 \u00b1 1.3\t389 \u00b1 50\t1.0 \u00b1 2.0\n\tREW\t368 \u00b1 45\t0.6 \u00b1 1.6\t372 \u00b1 40\t0.6 \u00b1 1.7\n\tPUN\t371 \u00b1 41\t0.7 \u00b1 1.7\t375 \u00b1 40\t0.6 \u00b1 1.5\n\tCOM\t372 \u00b1 40\t0.0 \u00b1 0.0\t380 \u00b1 41\t0.4 \u00b1 1.3\nIncongruent trials\tNEU\t469 \u00b1 49\t13.7 \u00b1 12.0\t473 \u00b1 79\t14.4 \u00b1 11.9\n\tREW\t450 \u00b1 48\t16.8 \u00b1 15.0\t459 \u00b1 61\t13.9 \u00b1 12.5\n\tPUN\t455 \u00b1 50\t16.6 \u00b1 14.6\t468 \u00b1 63\t16.0 \u00b1 12.7\n\tCOM\t458 \u00b1 51\t15.2 \u00b1 12.1\t458 \u00b1 64\t13.4 \u00b1 10.3\nRandom trials\tNEU\t422 \u00b1 51\t3.4 \u00b1 4.2\t433 \u00b1 63\t6.9 \u00b1 7.3\n\tREW\t406 \u00b1 52\t5.7 \u00b1 6.3\t414 \u00b1 62\t6.4 \u00b1 5.7\n\tPUN\t408 \u00b1 53\t4.9 \u00b1 5.3\t425 \u00b1 64\t4.8 \u00b1 5.8\n\tCOM\t409 \u00b1 59\t3.4 \u00b1 3.8\t423 \u00b1 59\t6.9 \u00b1 6.4\nfMRI EXPERIMENT\tfMRI EXPERIMENT\tfMRI EXPERIMENT\tfMRI EXPERIMENT\tfMRI EXPERIMENT\tfMRI EXPERIMENT\nAll trials\t\t438 \u00b1 38\t3.1 \u00b1 3.2\t440 \u00b1 43\t2.2 \u00b1 2.5\nCongruent trials\tNEU\t409 \u00b1 34\t0.3 \u00b1 0.7\t411 \u00b1 43\t0.2 \u00b1 0.7\n\tREW\t398 \u00b1 40\t1.1 \u00b1 1.7\t401 \u00b1 42\t0.2 \u00b1 0.7\n\tPUN\t399 \u00b1 40\t0.8 \u00b1 1.7\t403 \u00b1 47\t0.2 \u00b1 1.0\n\tCOM\t400 \u00b1 42\t0.1 \u00b1 0.5\t403 \u00b1 45\t0.6 \u00b1 1.6\nIncongruent trials\tNEU\t484 \u00b1 41\t4.3 \u00b1 3.6\t484 \u00b1 48\t3.6 \u00b1 4.1\n\tREW\t475 \u00b1 41\t6.0 \u00b1 7.8\t474 \u00b1 44\t4.4 \u00b1 4.5\n\tPUN\t473 \u00b1 40\t7.1 \u00b1 9.3\t476 \u00b1 45\t4.7 \u00b1 6.4\n\tCOM\t478 \u00b1 40\t4.7 \u00b1 4.6\t473 \u00b1 45\t3.4 \u00b1 5.0\n### Caption\nDescriptive statistics of the behavioral data.\n### Footer\nMean reaction times (RT) of correct responses and error rates \u00b1 standard deviations (SD) are shown.

Prior to training, activation elicited during lip purse showed evidence of cortical reorganization of motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices, expanding from lip area to hand area, which correlated with pain scores. In addition, during imagined movement of the phantom hand, and executed movement of the intact hand, group maps demonstrated activation not only in bilateral M1 and S1 hand area, but also lip area, showing a two-way process of reorganization. In healthy participants, activation during lip purse and imagined and executed movement of the non-dominant hand was confined to the respective cortical representation areas only. Following training, patients reported a significant reduction in intensity and unpleasantness of constant pain and exacerbations, with a corresponding elimination of cortical reorganization.   Post hoc   analyses showed that intensity of constant pain, but not exacerbations, correlated with reduction in cortical reorganization. The results of this study add to our current understanding of the pathophysiology of PLP, underlining the reversibility of neuroplastic changes in this patient population while offering a novel, simple method of pain relief. \n \n\n# Body\n \nConverging neuroanatomic, neurophysiological and clinical evidence suggests that amputation is associated with neuroplastic changes in the sensory and motor cortices (Flor   et al  .,  ). This change takes the form of a shift of cortical representation from neighbouring areas of the somatosensory (Mackert   et al  .,  ) and motor maps (Chen   et al  .,  ) to the deafferented cortical representation. The clinical manifestations of this change include phantom limb sensations and phantom limb pain (PLP). In upper limb amputees, the extent of somatotopic shift from the face area to the deafferented hand area has been shown to correlate with the incidence and severity of phantom pain (Lotze   et al  .,  ). \n\nThere is no clear understanding as to why deafferentation and subsequent expansion of the cortical representation of the face into the hand area causes pain, rather than just an abnormal perception. It has been hypothesized that it may be due to efferent motor cortical activity continuing without afferent sensory feedback to dampen motor commands (Harris,  ). In other words, motor cortical activity is not inhibited by sensory cortical activation verifying that the required movement has indeed taken place. Clinical evidence that cortical deafferentation plays a role in phantom pain generation comes from observations that phantom pain may be relieved by imagining stretching movements of the hand, or by using a strategically placed mirror to give the illusion that the missing hand has returned and can be purposefully moved (Ramachandran and Hirstein,  ). Other methods that compensate for sensory deafferentation may also have an analgesic effect, such as the regular use of a myoelectric prosthesis (Lotze   et al  .,  ; Weiss   et al  .,  ). Improvement of pain from pharmacological treatment has also been suggested to be associated with reduction of cortical reorganization (Huse   et al  .,  ). \n\nThis study was designed to test the analgesic effect of a mental imagery exercise while searching for answers to the generation and maintenance of phantom limb pain, as it relates to cortical reorganization. The challenge in this was to recognize the many different types of painful and non-painful sensations that patients with phantom limb pain describe. From a search of the relevant literature and our own extensive clinical practice we concluded that pertinent aspects of pain in the phantom were as follows: (i) Patients describe two types of pain; continuous pain of varying intensity (\u2018constant\u2019 pain) and attacks of pain varying in duration from seconds to hours (\u2018exacerbations\u2019 of pain); these appear to be independent of each other, (ii) While finding it difficult to describe the emotional content accurately they are able to estimate the degree of unpleasantness, (iii) The phantom or parts of the phantom can be perceived as well as its exposure to sensory and motor tasks, (iv) Touching the face (in the case of upper limb amputees) occasionally produces a projection of sensation into the phantom hand, (v) Severe pain in the phantom can extend beyond the phantom itself and (vi) Various manipulations aimed at changing the dominance of the phantom in an individual's personal experience (distraction, sensory stimulation of the stump using transcutaneous electric stimulation or spinal cord stimulation, use of a prosthesis, visual illusions using the mirror box and so on) are capable of reducing either or both types of pain. Based on these clinical observations, and results from previous brain imaging studies, we formulated four hypotheses we wished to test that link cortical reorganization to PLP (i) Cortical reorganization occurs so that representation of the face expands to invade some of the representation of the missing limb (cf. Flor   et al  .,  ), (ii) Cortical reorganization also occurs in the opposite direction with the representation of the missing limb expanding to the face and stump areas, (iii) These changes are associated with the intensity and/or the unpleasantness of PLP, (iv) A specific internally generated intervention, mental imagery to activate the sensory and motor cortices will reduce both cortical reorganization and reduce the intensity or unpleasantness of at least one of the pain types. \n\nStudies based on the effects of interventions trying to establish causality between pathology and subjective symptoms are problematic because of the difficulty of controlling for the effects of the interventions   per se  . With this in mind, we chose to discard the use of any external interventions and rely on the patient's mental imagery as the sole intervention. Mental imagery is known to activate the motor and sensory cortices, and we hypothesized that, if practiced regularly, it would provide sufficient stimulation of the deafferented neurons and potentially alter the reorganization (Flor   et al  .,  ). Any change in cortical reorganization produced by this method could then be correlated with pain descriptors in a more straightforward manner than would be the case if a chemical or mechanical intervention (pharmacotherapy, neurostimulation, visual stimulation) were applied. \n\nTo measure change in cortical reorganization we adopted the method developed by Lotze and others for this patient population (Lotze   et al  .,  ). They showed that in patients with upper limb phantom pain there was, during the simple act of the individual pursing his or her lips, an inappropriate activation of the face area in the somatosensory cortex that was not seen in patients with amputations with no pain, or control participants. We used this lip purse to measure the cortical shift from the face area to the hand/arm area (F\u2192H). To investigate the shift in the other direction (H\u2192F) we exploited the fact that an imagined task will activate the cortical area activated by actual execution of the task (Jeannerod,  ; Hesslow,  ). We therefore used imagined movement of the phantom to explore the shift in this opposite direction. \n\nTo enhance the analgesic efficacy of mental imagery, we wanted participants to use a simple method of achieving a state of moderate relaxation while simultaneously being able to perceive vivid movement and sensation. We chose a mindfulness-based \u2018body-scan\u2019 meditation technique as a means of achieving a relaxed state, based on a pain management technique developed by Kabat-Zinn   et al  . ( ). \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAll participants gave written, informed consent. Thirteen participants (11 males, 2 females, age range 32\u201375 years, mean 52.92 years, SD 13.6), with unilateral, upper limb amputation at least above the wrist and phantom limb pain of at least one year's duration participated (see   for demographic details). Time since amputation, and duration of pain was in the range of 3\u201351 years (mean 24.54 years, SD 17.1). Only one subject regularly took analgesia, and he abstained for 12 h prior to scanning to eliminate any medication effects on activation maps. The other two participants who reported sporadic analgesic intake at assessment had not taken any analgesia for several weeks prior to scanning.\n   \nDemographic details of clinical participants \n  \n\nParticipants were recruited from two local rehabilitation centres, a local pain clinic and the British Limbless Ex-Servicemen's Association (BLESMA). Six age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers (mean age 43 years, range 30\u201356) were also scanned to determine normal cortical responses to the tasks set. All participants were screened to ensure there were no MR contraindications. The study was approved by the local Research Ethics committee and the Research Governance committee at the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Liverpool, UK and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. \n\n\n### Clinical assessment \n  \nBefore and after the fMRI scans all clinical participants underwent a detailed interview using the following clinical measures:\n   \nDemographics: current coping strategies, sleep pattern, duration of pain and medication use. The clinical interview was repeated at the final fMRI session. \n  \nPhantom limb pain questionnaire (Kooijman   et al  .,  ): to measure the incidence of stump pain, phantom limb phenomena (i.e. any phantom sensations not considered painful), phantom pain and prosthesis use. \n  \nBeck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (Beck   et al  .,  ,  ): to exclude severe anxiety or depression which could be worsened by participation in deep relaxation classes. \n  \nVividness of Imagery Scale (Lotze   et al  .,  ): to measure the vividness of each subject's perception of their ability to move the phantom limb, where 0 = no perception of any voluntary movement to 6 = very vivid perception of voluntary phantom movement. \n  \nNumerical rating scale (NRS): to measure intensity of pain (0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain imaginable) and unpleasantness (0 = not unpleasant at all, 10 = extreme unpleasantness). For statistical analysis, an average of diary scores over the past week was calculated. Participants completed daily pain diaries during the week following assessment, the 6 weeks of the intervention and the week prior to the final scan. Intensity and unpleasantness of constant pain and exacerbations of pain (number, duration, intensity and unpleasantness) were recorded, as all recruits stated that these unpredictable, severe bouts of pain were the most difficult to cope with. \n  \nEstimates of pain during the scanning session were taken immediately after the session was finished (\u2018contemporaneous\u2019 pain). \n  \n\n\n### fMRI study design and procedure \n  \nParticipants first performed a simple lip purse during fMRI (before and after the therapy), measured against rest, to establish the extent of cortical reorganization from face to hand area in motor and somatosensory representational maps (Lotze   et al  .,  ). Secondly they performed rhythmic opening and closing of the intact fist (non-dominant left hand in the case of controls, to match movement of the left intact limb of the patient group), also measured against rest, to explore the function of the ipsilateral cortex in PLP patients and serve as a functional localiser. Thirdly, all participants imagined movement of both hands, alternating right dominant/phantom with left non-dominant/intact hand, measured against rest, to reveal other cortical reorganization that would extend beyond the face area. \n\nImagined movement of the intact hand was also used to determine the non-specific effects of the meditation process. \n\nParticipants rehearsed the task outside the scanner immediately before the scanning session, including having the opportunity to practise while listening to a CD of the noise of the EPI scans. They were instructed to perform the lip purse and the hand movements at a rate of 0.5 Hz and to keep to this pace during the scan, and they were monitored visually during scanning to ensure accuracy of performance without extraneous movement. The scanning paradigm consisted of a simple block design. After 30 s of rest, the task (lip purse, opening and closing of the fist or imagining movement of each hand) was performed for 30 s, followed by another 30 s of rest, for a period of 6.5 min. An investigator stayed in the scanning room with each subject, and they were cued by a light tap on the leg for \u2018start\u2019 and two taps for \u2018stop\u2019. \n\n\n### Clinical intervention \n  \nFollowing the first scanning session, each patient saw the therapist for six sessions of individual therapy, either once a week or once a fortnight, depending on his or her other commitments. Each session lasted one hour\u201440 minutes for the therapy and 20 minutes for debriefing. Recruits rested on a chair or couch, and the room was quiet (but not silent) and private. Therapy was a combination of the \u2018body-scan\u2019 exercise and imagined movement of and sensation in the phantom limb. \n\nThe body-scan facilitated relaxation and imagery. In particular recruits learned to concentrate on sensations from each area of the body consecutively, including the phantom arm and hand. Once a state of relaxation was achieved the recruit was encouraged to imagine comfortable and thorough movement and sensation in the phantom limb. More specifically recruits were encouraged to focus on sensation from each part of the phantom, for example imagining the sensation of the arm resting against the couch, whether the limb felt warm or cool, the position of each finger. Next, they were invited to imagine comfortable and thorough movement and sensation in the phantom limb, such that they could \u2018stretch away the pain\u2019, and finally to \u2018allow the fingers, hand and arm to rest in a comfortable position\u2019. The actual therapy of \u2018moving\u2019 and \u2018feeling\u2019 the limb lasted for \u223c5 min. \n\nRecruits were given a 40-min CD of the meditation and imagery exercises (personalized to take account of whether the right or left limb had been amputated, but otherwise adhering to a script) and were encouraged to practise daily. Recruits were also taught a short, 10 min form of the meditation/imagery exercise, which they could use without a CD. \n\nRecruits kept a daily record of meditation practice recording the time spent practising, the immediate effect on pain and free space for any comments. By Week 3, all participants were competent in achieving the relaxation, and were then encouraged, in addition to the formalized CD practice, to move and feel the phantom several times daily, without having to resort to the relaxation exercise. All participants stated that adherence to the therapy was enhanced by the weekly visits to the therapist. Follow-up scans were repeated within 6 weeks of completion of the intervention. The healthy volunteers were also scanned twice but received no intervention. \n\n\n### Scanning procedure \n  \nMRI data were acquired using a 3T Siemen's Trio MR Scanner (Erlangen, Germany). FMRI was performed with a blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) sensitive T *-weighted multislice gradient echo EPI sequence (TE = 50 ms, TR = 3 s, flip angle = 90\u00b0, FOV = 19 cm, 128 \u00d7 128 matrix). Twenty-eight contiguous 4 mm thick axial slices were prescribed parallel to the AC\u2013PC line and covered the whole brain. One hundred thirty three EPI volumes were collected in total (after saturation scans). For the purpose of anatomical referencing and visualization of brain activation, a high-resolution T -weighted 3D inversion recovery prepared gradient echo (IRp-GRASS) sequence was acquired (TE = 5.4 ms, TR = 12.3 ms, TI = 450 ms, 1 mm slice thickness, FOV = 20 cm, 256 \u00d7 192 matrix), with 128 axial slices covering the whole brain. \n\n\n### Data analysis overview \n  \nFMRI data analysis was carried out using FEAT 3.3 software (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool, version 3.3, Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Analysis of the Brain\u2014FMRIB \u2013 University of Oxford), part of the FMRIB software library (Smith   et al  .,  ). The following pre-statistics processing was applied; motion correction using MCFLIRT (Jenkinson and Smith,  ); spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 5 mm; mean-based intensity normalization of all volumes by the same factor; non-linear high-pass temporal filtering (\u03c3 = 120 s Gaussian-weighted LSF straight line fitting). Statistical analysis was carried out using FILM (FMRIB's Improved Linear Model) with local autocorrelation correction of the data (non-linear spatial smoothing and prewhitening\u2014Smith and Brady,  ; Woolrich   et al  .,  ). In order to test for group level differences we defined the following contrasts at the first level\u2014lip purse versus rest; executed movement of left intact arm versus rest; imagined movement of each hand versus rest. To accommodate inter-subject variability, the contrast images from all participants were then entered into a mixed effects group analysis carried out using FEAT 3.3 software (Beckmann   et al  .,  ; Woolrich   et al  .,  ). Statistical images were thresholded using clusters determined by   Z   = 2.3,   P   < 0.05 cluster-corrected and transformed into the stereotaxic space of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), using FLIRT (FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool\u2014Jenkinson and Smith,  ). Additionally the raw data from the four left amputees was flipped so that all images of the left hemisphere would be contralateral to the amputated side, to allow group comparison of activation ipsi- and contralateral to the amputated side. \n\nThe following pain scores were also added to group General Linear Model (GLM) analysis of fMRI data as covariates of interest: intensity of pain experienced during the scan (\u2018contemporaneous pain\u2019), constant pain intensity and unpleasantness, and exacerbation intensity and unpleasantness. Differences in activation before and after the intervention were compared with pairwise   t  -tests and whole brain maps inspected. The pain scores were used as a regressor within the GLM to confirm a positive covariance with the BOLD signal, allowing identification, voxel-by-voxel, of those areas of the brain where there was a reduction in activation relating to a reduction in pain scores. \n\nHand and lip M1 and S1 coordinates were identified by using the mean of coordinates from the brain imaging literature \u00b18 mm in each plane, plus mean group coordinates of both the clinical participants and the healthy volunteers. \n\n[Lip M1 (mm):   xyz   \u00b1 52, \u20138, 36. S1 (mm):   xyz   \u00b1 58, \u201318, 24. Hand M1 (mm):   xyz   \u00b1 34, \u201334, 52. S1 (mm)   xyz   \u00b1 34,\u201330, 58. Porro   et al  .,  ; Lotze   et al  .,  ; Dettmers   et al  .,  ; Roux   et al  .,  ; Stippich   et al  .,  ; Ehrsson   et al  .,  ]. Individual brains were also inspected to locate the hand \u2018knob\u2019 on M1 and S1 (Yousry   et al  .,  ). In individuals and groups, activation maxima were obtained from the cluster lists provided within the FSL results, and FSLview was used to inspect and display images and to confirm the functional location. This location was confirmed with the Duvernoy brain atlas (Duvernoy,  ). \n\nThe generous 8 mm latitude in all planes allowed for individual variations in representational maps, both normal and abnormal. Inspection of individual maps confirmed the presence of activation within these boundaries, therefore each individual contributed to the group analysis. \n\nHealthy volunteers were scanned twice to address the role of possible non-specific effects due to increased thresholds for neural activation because of, e.g. familiarization of the tasks. No significant group differences were found between the first and the second scan (analysed at   P   < 0.05 uncorrected) in bilateral M1 and S1; and the similarity of neural activation patterns was confirmed by inspection of individual maps. We therefore proceeded to analyse patient data confident that changes in the neural activations of patients would reflect genuine effects from the intervention. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Clinical results \n  \nNone of the recruits had raised psychometric scores on the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventories at assessment or at follow up and all were either in full-time employment or pursuing an active, retired lifestyle. All had suffered from phantom pain since immediately after amputation ( ). Mean constant pain intensity was 7.5 before training (range 3\u201310, SD 2.3) with a mean unpleasantness score of 5 (range 2\u20139 SD 1.7); mean number of daily exacerbations was 9 (range 0\u201343 SD 12.0) at a mean intensity of 6 (range 0\u20139 SD 2.6 see   and  ) and a mean unpleasantness score of 6 (range 0\u20139, SD 2.7). One patient had no exacerbations of pain. All participants successfully completed the course of therapy and by week 3 were competent at following the meditation and mental imagery exercises.\n   \nScores of constant pain intensity and unpleasantness before and after training, measured by daily pain diaries using numerical rating scores. Reduction in pain intensity was significant (  P   < 0.0005), as was reduction in pain unpleasantness (  P   < 0.01). \n    \nChanges in daily exacerbations of pain\u2014intensity and unpleasantness of pain, using numerical rating scores. Reduction of intensity of exacerbations was significant (  P   < 0.005) as was the reduction in unpleasantness of exacerbations (  P   < 0.03). \n    \nNumerical ratings of constant pain (intensity and perception of unpleasantness) and exacerbations (intensity and unpleasantness) before and after training in mental imagery \n    \n\nAt the end of training in therapy, 9 of the 13 participants had gained >50% pain relief (  and  ). The most noticeable benefit for the participants was the reduction in the number and severity of exacerbations with six participants free from exacerbations of pain at the end of the study (  and   and  ). Of the three patients taking analgesia, two had discontinued and one had reduced his requirements for codeine phosphate and zopiclone. \n\nThe group mean vividness of imagery scores at outset was 4 (range 2\u20136 SD 1.8) and at follow-up 5 (range 3\u20136 SD 1.1,   P   > 0.12, not statistically significant). \n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \n#### Lip purse \n  \nIn patients, prior to training, lip purse resulted in bilateral activation in M1 and S1 lip/face area. In addition, in the left hemisphere (contralateral to the amputation) activation extended into M1 hand area [(mm)   xyz   \u201330, \u201336, 52] and, to a lesser extent into S1 hand/arm area [(mm)   xyz   \u201322, \u201336, 56]. Other significant activation sites, including bilateral insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), thalamus and cerebellum are reported in   and see  . In healthy volunteers, activation during lip purse was confined to bilateral M1 and S1 lip area only, without concomitant activation in M1/S1 hand area. Other significant activation sites are presented in  .\n   \nActivations in response to lip purse: patients before and after training: yellow circles indicate M1/S1 lip area. Activation in hand area M1/S1 is shown in axial view (inset). At follow-up activation is less diffuse and more confined to lip area. There is no activation in hand area M1/S1 (inset: shown in axial view). Healthy volunteers show activation in M1 lip area only. \n    \nLip purse: paired   t  -tests of activation (baseline minus follow up), with pain scores as covariates \n    \n\nAfter training, lip purse again produced bilateral activation of M1 and S1 in the lip/face area. However, there was no suprathreshold or sub-threshold activation of contralateral M1 and S1 hand area ( ,  ). \n\nPatients also differed from healthy participants in that activation in bilateral M1 lip area was more medial [contralateral to amputation (mm)   xyz   \u201352, \u20138, 52 versus \u201360, \u201312, 36; ipsilateral to amputation (mm)   xyz   54, \u201312, 34 versus 66, \u201310, 32] ( ). This was also the case in bilateral S1 lip area [contralateral (mm)   xyz   \u201354, \u201316, 26 versus \u201362, \u201312, 24; ipsilateral 58, \u201312, 26 versus 62, \u20138, 24]. After training, M1 activation in the clinical group was more lateral in both hemispheres [contralateral (mm)   xyz   \u201358, \u201310, 33, ipsilateral 60, \u20138, 30, 6 mm lateral shift see  ]. \n\nBefore training, the extent of activation in contralateral M1 hand area covaried significantly with the severity of contemporaneous pain (i.e. pain experienced during the scan reported by the patient on NRS 0\u201310 immediately after the imaging session) but not intensity or unpleasantness of diary-based constant and exacerbation pain scores. Activation in SI did not covary with any pain attribute. In contrast, constant pain covaried with lip purse induced activation in ipsilateral thalamus and contralateral insula. (It should be noted that lip purse itself did not evoke any phantom pain during the scan.) \n\nAfter training, reduction in constant pain scores covaried significantly with the reduction of activation in response to lip purse in contralateral M1 hand/arm area, ipsilateral M1 and S1 hand/arm area, as well as bilateral ACC ( ). Reduction in contemporaneous pain covaried with reduction in activation in ipsilateral M1 and S1 and contralateral ACC, insula and thalamus, but not contralateral MI or S1. Reduction in intensity of exacerbation pain did not covary with activations in primary sensory or motor cortices, although covariance was seen with contralateral ACC and insula. Reduction in scores of unpleasantness of constant pain and exacerbations of pain covaried with reduced activation in ipsilateral M1 and S1 hand areas with further covariance with bilateral ACC and contralateral insula. \n\n\n#### Imagined movement of hands (right) phantom movement \n  \nIn both groups, activation was seen in contralateral MI and SI representing the hand [M1 (mm)   xyz   \u201338, \u201332, 52; S1 (mm)   xyz   \u201338, \u201332, 58] and SII and bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) and ACC in accordance with other reports (Ehrsson   et al  .,  ). In patients, activation was also seen in the contralateral face area within the MI and S1 strip [M1 (mm)   xyz   \u201350, \u201310, 36; S1 (mm)   xyz   \u201348, \u20138, 28], ipsilateral SII, and bilateral thalamus, insula and cerebellum. After training, the excessive activations in bilateral face MI and ipsilateral hand SI were no longer present. No covariance was found between ipsi- or contralateral M1 and S1 activations and any pain scores either before or after training (see   and  ).\n   \nStrong bilateral activation in response to left executed hand movement and right imagined hand movement seen in patients as opposed to healthy volunteers. \n  \n\n\n#### Imagined movement of intact (left) hand \n  \nIn the patient group, there was activation in response to imagined movement of the left intact hand in bilateral hand area but not face area. There was no significant change in activation maps at follow up and no covariance with any pain scores. In the control group, activation in response to imagined movement of the left, non-dominant hand resulted in minimal activation in contralateral hand M1 and S1 only (see   and  ). \n\n\n#### Executed movement of intact (left) hand \n  \nAreas activated in common to both groups were contralateral M1 and S1 hand area, contralateral thalamus, midline SMA, bilateral insula and bilateral cerebellum. In patients, activation also occurred in ipsilateral hand area [MI (mm)   xyz   \u201330, \u201334, 52], ipsilateral lip area [M1 (mm)   xyz   \u201348, \u201320, 36], contralateral SII, contralateral inferior temporal and bilateral medial frontal gyrus (see   and  ,  ). After training, active movement of the hand failed to provoke activation in the ipsilateral lip motor cortex while activation in ipsilateral hand motor area appeared much reduced.\n   \nLip purse: paired   t  -test of lip purse activations before and after training with pain scores added as covariates. Left map: illustration of activation remaining when follow-up lip purse is subtracted from baseline lip purse, with reduction in contemporaneous pain added as a covariate. Activation remains in right M1 hand area (ipsilateral to amputated side) and left ACC. Right map: illustration of activation remaining when follow-up lip purse is subtracted from baseline lip purse, with reduction in constant pain added as a covariate. Activation remains in bilateral M1 hand/arm area, supplementary motor area (SMA), ipsilateral SI and secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). \n  \n\nBefore training, ipsilateral (i.e. contralateral to phantom) M1 and S1 hand area activation covaried significantly with constant pain intensity. After training, reduction in any form of recorded pain failed to covary with any changes in activation maps. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study of PLP in upper limb amputees, the remarkably simple technique of imagining movement and sensation in the missing limb resulted in significant pain relief. All subjects found learning the body scan useful as a means of relaxation, regardless of whether their pain lessened, and they all felt that the body scan was a useful facilitator to imagining the return of the phantom limb. \n\nOther researchers have reported the clinical benefit of imagined and virtual movement in patients with long-standing pain conditions. Moseley ( ) demonstrated significant pain relief in patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and PLP when they first learned to improve laterality recognition using photographs of hands in varying positions, and then learned to imagine the injured hand in non-painful postures. Mirror therapy has also been reported to have an analgesic effect in PLP (Chan   et al  .,  ). So it seems that different ways of stimulating the motor and sensory cortices can be effective in relieving pain. Cortical reorganization patterns have also been shown to be a feature of CRPS, with changes in somatotopic cortical maps which normalize upon symptomatic recovery due to physiotherapy (Maihofner   et al  .,  ) or treatment with memantine (Sinis   et al  .,  ). \n\nThe primary focus of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between cortical reorganization, the various forms of pain in patients with phantom limb pain syndrome and the analgesic effect of mental imagery. We employed lip purse as a tool to demonstrate activation, measured by fMRI, in the hand area; such activation is not seen in healthy participants and is best explained by a change in the excitability of cortical neurons previously responsive to functions involving the hand or arm only. The relevance of this finding comes from the direct correlation between the hand area activation and contemporaneous pain (i.e. pain experienced during scanning), and is emphasized by the fact that, with significant pain reduction during the second scanning session, no such abnormal activation was elicited. That the association was seen in contemporaneous pain only and not with the pain scores obtained from pain diaries, suggests that in a given patient with PLP the at-present state of pain is a better indication of reorganization than is a general disposition of pain. Disappearance on the post-training scan of this abnormal activation in the patients, who for the major part experienced significant pain relief, points in the same direction. The contemporaneous pain scores on that occasion were so low that no correlation with them and the BOLD signal in the hand area could be reasonably expected; indeed none was found. \n\nAnother tool used in this study to measure cortical reorganization was that of imagined movement of the phantom. A novel finding in the present study was that cortical reorganization appears to have taken place in a more random fashion than previously thought, although such a finding supports clinical observations such as sensory experiences in the head reported by patients with a phantom arm (Ramachandran and Hirstein,  ). Imagined movement of the phantom hand led to activation of the lip area which was not seen in healthy volunteers, which may be a form of \u2018reverse\u2019 functional reorganization (H\u2192F). Interestingly, however, this change did not covary with any pain type. We conclude that this abnormality is likely to represent the effect of amputation   per se   and may not be critical for the development of pain. In line with this, movement of the intact hand resulted in activation of the ipsilateral lip area in the motor strip (i.e. contralateral to the phantom) and was also devoid of any covariance with pain scores. \n\nAdditionally, we were impressed by the consistent extensive activation of the M1 and S1 hand representation area contralateral to the phantom, irrespective of the task (lip purse, imagined movement of the phantom, imagined movement of the intact arm or executed movement of the intact arm). This kind of universal activation, exemplifying a lack of neural efficiency has been reported by others using motor evoked potentials (MEP; Cohen   et al  .,  ); transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; Roricht   et al  .,  ; Karl   et al  .,  ) and fMRI (Lotze   et al  .,  ). Interestingly, this excessive activation during intact arm movement, which was lacking in controls, covaried with constant pain, and adds to the significance of altered activity in M1/S1 region following nervous system injury (Navarro   et al  .,  ). \n\nIt has been proposed that the perception of phantom movement relies upon the preservation of a cortical representation of the missing limb, itself dependent upon intact neuronal connections (Mercier   et al  .,  ; Reilly   et al  .,  ). It is of interest that our patients recognized improvement in freedom of movement of the phantom as training progressed, suggesting they achieved better mental access to the deafferented cortical areas (Mercier   et al  .,  ). The decrease in activation post-training seen in this area is likely to reflect improved neural efficiency and precision, similarly to that seen after other forms of cognitive training (Kelly   et al  .,  ). A further interesting finding was the extensive bilateral activation in primary sensory and motor cortices observed in patients during every task. \n\nAgainst this background it is of interest that during active movement of the intact limb, our patient group showed increased activation in the M1 and S1 hand areas contralateral to the phantom (ipsilateral to the intact arm) that at baseline correlated with the intensity of constant pain. Activation of ipsilateral S1 and M1 has been shown in patients with neuropathic pain in response to provocation of allodynic pain (Peyron   et al  .,  ). Our finding needs to be interpreted with caution, however. First, no patient reported any pain associated with the increased use of the intact arm and secondly, functional cortical reorganization, both inter- and intra-hemispheric, is well documented in the brain imaging literature in models of health and disease (Pascual-Leone   et al  .,  ). Although earlier primate studies suggest that cortical reorganization after amputation in primates is contralateral from neighbouring areas of the somatotopic map (Wu and Kaas,  ), a later study using an animal model of extensive hind- and forepaw surgical peripheral denervation has established bilateral cortical\u2013cortical reorganization (Pelled   et al  .,  ). \n\nBilateral cortical activation is reported in amputees without pain. Hamzei   et al  . ( ) studied seven participants who had been missing an arm since childhood (six amputees and one dysmelia)\u2014all demonstrated bilateral structural and functional cortical changes [measured using MRI, fMRI and transcranial stimulation mapping (TMS)], including contralateral and ipsilateral M1 activation in response to finger tapping. Similar bilateral activation has been shown in lower limb amputees using TMS during movement of the intact limb (Schwenkreis   et al  .,  ). Kelly and Garavan ( ) suggest that in healthy volunteers, cortical plasticity in response to the challenge of learning a new task (in our case, mental imagery of the phantom) has a 2-fold physiological mechanism. Developing greater motor skill rests on increased neural efficiency (demonstrated in our participants by the reduction in activation shown after regular practice of imagined movement and sensation in the phantom limb), while developing a new strategy (for example, learning to be one-armed following amputation) relates to plastic change which usually presents itself in enhancement of activation. \n\nThus it seems that cortical reorganization following amputation is 2-fold\u2014with intrahemispheric reorganization from the adjacent area on the homunculus, and interhemispheric reorganization from the recruitment of horizontal connections of the intact limb representation to the deafferented cortex. Why cortical reorganization of the kind we report here is associated with pain cannot be answered. The cortical reorganization we witnessed in patients during various tasks, prior to the clinical intervention, reduced in relation to the reduction in pain, but we cannot offer evidence that the link is causative. Nevertheless, reduction of cortical reorganization (i.e. reduction of activation in contralateral M1 and S1 hand area, induced by lip purse, to sub-threshold levels in group analysis) after training in our patients covaried with reduction of their constant pain scores. Reductions in activations in ipsilateral hand MI and SI covaried with intensity of contemporaneous and constant pain intensity, and unpleasantness of exacerbation scores. These findings are supportive of the concept of a relationship between cortical reorganization and PLP as previously suggested (Lotze   et al  .,  ; Flor   et al  .,  ). It is reinforced by the fact that we intentionally chose an intervention that was minimalist and aimed at repeatedly activating the primary motor and sensory cortices. It is intriguing that the relationship appears to be selective: it was condensed to F \u2192 H type reorganization, and primarily associated with ongoing and constant pain, and not exacerbations. For the latter, alternative mechanisms should be explored. \n\nWhile the focus of this study was on the association of pain relief and reorganization of the sensory and motor cortices, we did observe a general reduction in all brain areas during the second scan after training. These more general activations could be explored in future studies using a control group of either healthy volunteers subjected to an intervention mimicking treatment, or patients with similar amputations not subjected to treatment, to establish whether they are a pathophysiological correlate of amputation or pain or mainly reflect natural fluctuation, familiarization with imagined movement or a similar non-specific effect. A further limitation of this study lies in the fact that we have reported group results with the danger of missing individual data due to normalization. However, inspection of individual activation maps showed little variability or deviation from the mean coordinates and boundaries described in the methodology. A future study where analysis of the individual relationship between BOLD response and pain measurements may be desirable, using a technique such as flatmapping to measure the definitive spatial extent of activation maps. \n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that, significant associations exist between different types of phantom limb pain and cortical reorganization, and that regularly practiced mental imagery results in pain relief, which is associated with a reduction in cortical reorganization. These results in part corroborate previous findings and add new important information, especially in the domain of neuroplasticity, suggesting that plastic changes may be surprisingly responsive to internally generated manipulation. Challenges that remain for future research include how to establish which aspect of reorganization is related to pain, whether reorganization drives the pain or vice versa, the role of any morphological changes and investigation of measures that might prevent the maladaptive effect of amputation on the cortex. Perhaps the most pivotal question relates to the exact mechanisms, whereby cortical reorganization is linked to PLP, which no study to date has unravelled. The therapeutic efficacy of the intervention in the present study was so impressive that a controlled trial seems warranted, encompassing a design that can bring together the various therapies (imagery, laterality recognition, mirror box), to determine which virtual therapy best suits which patient. \n\n\n## Supplementary material \n  \n is available at Brain online. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nID\tM/F\tAge\tL or R amputation\tAbove/below elbow\tReason for amputation\tYears since amputation\tProsthesis use\n1\tM\t68\tLeft\tBelow\tBone cancer\t51\tMyoelectric cosmetic\n2\tM\t52\tLeft\tAbove\tTrauma\t35\t\n3\tM\t33\tRight\tAbove\tTrauma\t12\t\n4\tM\t58\tRight\tBelow\tTrauma\t35\t\n5\tM\t68\tRight\tAbove\tTrauma\t42\tCosmetic\n6\tM\t41\tRight\tAbove\tTrauma\t22\tCosmetic\n7\tF\t51\tLeft\tBelow\tTrauma\t4\t\n8\tM\t59\tRight\tAbove\tTrauma\t6\tCosmetic\n9\tF\t42\tRight\tAbove\tTrauma\t36\tCosmetic\n10\tM\t62\tRight\tAbove\tTrauma\t3\tCosmetic\n11\tM\t75\tRight\tBelow\tTrauma\t43\tCosmetic\n12\tM\t32\tLeft\tAbove\tTrauma\t5\t\n13\tM\t47\tRight\tAbove\tTrauma\t25\tCosmetic\n### Caption\nDemographic details of clinical participants\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: T2\n### Label: Table 2\nID\tConstant pain\tConstant pain\tConstant pain\tConstant pain\tExacerbations of pain\tExacerbations of pain\tExacerbations of pain\tExacerbations of pain\tAnalgesia\tAnalgesia\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tIntensity\tIntensity\tUnpleasantness\tUnpleasantness\tIntensity\tIntensity\tUnpleasantness\tUnpleasantness\tUnnamed: 9_level_1\tUnnamed: 10_level_1\nUnnamed: 0_level_2\tPre\tPost\tPre\tPost\tPre\tPost\tPre\tPost\tPre\tPost\n1\t3\t2\t2\t1\t6\t0\t5\t0\t\t\n2\t5\t1\t5\t1\t9\t0\t6\t0\t\t\n3\t10\t8\t6\t6\t9\t8\t7\t7\ta b c d e f\t\u2193a b c d \u2193e f\n4\t10\t6\t8\t3\t8\t5\t8\t0\t\t\n5\t10\t5\t6\t3\t6\t0\t8\t0\tg\t\n6\t5\t5\t4\t3\t6\t6\t6\t4\t\t\n7\t8\t3\t5\t2\t3\t1\t4\t0\t\t\n8\t9\t8\t6\t5\t7\t8\t8\t8\t\t\n9\t5\t1\t3\t1\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\t\n10\t8\t1\t2\t2\t3\t0\t5\t0\t\t\n11\t8\t3\t1\t1\t7\t2\t7\t3\t\t\n12\t8\t3\t6\t3\t7\t2\t7\t3\tg\t\n13\t9\t8\t9\t7\t9\t8\t9\t8\t\t\n### Caption\nNumerical ratings of constant pain (intensity and perception of unpleasantness) and exacerbations (intensity and unpleasantness) before and after training in mental imagery\n### Footer\nAnalgesia: a = codeine phosphate;

Damage in different language nodes may influence whether local plasticity is possible and whether right hemisphere recruitment is beneficial. However, the relationships of both lesion size and location to patterns of remapping are poorly understood. In the context of a picture naming fMRI task, we tested whether lesion size and location relate to activity in surviving left hemisphere language nodes, as well as homotopic activity in the right hemisphere during covert name retrieval and overt name production. We found that lesion size was positively associated with greater right hemisphere activity during both phases of naming, a pattern that has frequently been suggested but has not previously been clearly demonstrated. During overt naming, lesions in the inferior frontal gyrus led to deactivation of contralateral frontal areas, while lesions in motor cortex led to increased right motor cortex activity. Furthermore, increased right motor activity related to better naming performance only when left motor cortex was lesioned, suggesting compensatory takeover of speech or language function by the homotopic node. These findings demonstrate that reorganization of language function, and the degree to which reorganization facilitates aphasia recovery, is dependent on the size and site of the lesion. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nOne-third of stroke survivors suffer from loss of language ability [ ,  ]. Recovery rates vary greatly, for reasons that are poorly understood [ ]. The relationships between lesion site, activity pattern changes, and recovered language functions remain unclear. \n\n### 1.1. Reorganization of Language Function after Stroke \n  \nIn neuroimaging studies, patterns of increased activation during language tasks in chronic aphasia have been broadly consistent across studies. In a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies, collapsing across a wide range of language tasks, we found that people with aphasia consistently overactivated perilesional regions in the left hemisphere, as well as right hemisphere regions that were homotopic to the left hemisphere language network [ ]. In particular, people with lesions in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) were more likely to recruit right IFG than those without lesions in that area. However, the behavioral and biological drivers of these changes, as well as the degree to which they promote, inhibit, or are even relevant to recovery, remain open questions. \n\nThe increased activation in the preserved left hemisphere in people with aphasia has generally been associated with overall better performance [ \u2013 ]. However, the relationship between lesion size, location, and ability to use these preserved regions has not been carefully examined. For example, particularly severe participants may have larger lesions or lesions in highly critical areas. If this is the case, then the relationship between left hemisphere activity and language performance may be indirect, in that both are actually dependent on the severity and size of the stroke itself, as well as the availability of left hemisphere tissue adjacent to the critical areas. \n\nWithin the right hemisphere, the relationship between plasticity and language performance is even less clear. A number of lines of evidence suggest that engagement of the right hemisphere serves overall to support aphasia recovery (for review, see [ ]), suggesting a compensatory role for the right hemisphere homologues to language nodes. However, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies show that inhibiting the right IFG pars triangularis (PTr) improves fluency, naming, and other language measures in people with left hemisphere stroke [ \u2013 ]. This suggests that the right IFG, specifically right PTr, may be limiting recovery in people with left hemisphere lesions. Furthermore, neuroimaging studies show that early engagement of the right hemisphere during the acute phase promotes recovery but that disengagement of the right hemisphere in later stages is related to ongoing successful recovery [ \u2013 ]. Increased activation in the right hemisphere during the chronic stage of aphasia is associated with naming errors [ ] and overall worse performance, especially in picture-word naming and rhyme judgment [ ,  ]. \n\nUnfortunately, the same concerns arise when examining the function of the right hemisphere as were raised for the left, specifically, confounding with lesion size and location. The usefulness of a shift from right to left hemisphere activation during the chronic stages likely depends on the availability of remaining healthy left hemisphere tissue [ ]. Additionally, right hemisphere recruitment identified in neuroimaging studies may not be a consequence of plasticity at all. In neurologically healthy control subjects, right hemisphere activation has been shown to increase as a function of task difficulty [ ,  ]. Furthermore, right hemisphere activity appears to be greater in participants with larger overall left hemisphere lesions [ ], although this finding is only for some language tasks (picture naming, but not semantic judgment). Right hemisphere activity in people with aphasia, therefore, may actually be driven by the unique difficulty of the language tasks for people with aphasia. Right hemisphere activity may also reflect overactivation of any preserved tissue, of which there is less for people with large lesions, rather than actually remapping of function. However, the relationship between activity in the right hemisphere in people with aphasia, the rate of recovery, and actual plasticity remains unclear. \n\nBeyond the general anatomical patterns of reorganization and their association with good or bad outcomes, the mechanisms underlying reorganization remain unclear. Such mechanisms may include behaviorally driven reorganization, as in the plasticity induced by speech-language therapy [ ], or direct biological effects of the stroke itself. With regard to direct biological mechanisms underlying plasticity in language networks, relatively few specific hypotheses have been put forth. While some investigators, including ourselves, have previously described different patterns of reorganization (e.g., compensatory \u201ctakeover\u201d by a new area), these descriptions do not generally hypothesize a specific biological basis for these changes. The great virtue of specific biological hypotheses is that they generate specific testable predictions, especially with regard to the timing of plasticity, the relationship of specific lesion features such as size and location to the pattern of reorganization, and the relationship of brain changes to behavioral outcomes. \n\nOne such biological hypothesis which has gained a great deal of traction in recent years is the interhemispheric inhibition model, which is commonly invoked to explain recruitment of homotopic right hemisphere processors, negative relationships between right hemisphere activity and language performance, and the beneficial effects of right PTr inhibition [ ]. This hypothesis states that, in healthy people, there is transcallosal cross-hemispheric inhibition between language areas, similar to what has been demonstrated in motor areas [ ,  ]. A stroke in the left hemisphere theoretically disrupts the interhemispheric inhibitory balance, leading to overactivation of right hemispheric language areas homotopic to the lesion. In the context of the interhemispheric inhibition theory, the overactivated right hemisphere is thought to maladaptively inhibit perilesional left hemisphere areas, resulting in worse outcomes [ ]. \n\nIn particular, the interhemispheric inhibition model makes at least three specific testable claims. First, larger lesions in the left hemisphere should be associated with more activity in the right hemisphere. Second, left hemisphere lesions should be associated with increased activity specifically in homotopic regions in the right hemisphere. Finally, increased right hemisphere activity in homotopic areas should be related to worse language abilities, even at the chronic stage. Some of the prior evidence regarding the latter two claims is outlined above. The predicted relationship between lesion size and right hemisphere recruitment is frequently mentioned in reviews on aphasia recovery either in the context of interhemispheric inhibition or based on the logical argument that if no left hemisphere tissue remains, the right hemisphere must be recruited for any recovery to occur [ ,  ,  ]. However, the empirical evidence supporting this relationship is lacking and based primarily on small case series using methods that do not control for the accuracy of task performance [ ]. \n\n\n### 1.2. Cognitive Models of Naming \n  \nLexical-retrieval processes involve accessing concept knowledge and mapping phonological representations, stored in long-term memory [ ] and these two stages are supported by distinct cortical regions. Phonological retrieval is ascribed to a ventral stream of processing, in which phonological representations in the posterior superior temporal lobe map onto semantic and conceptual information in the angular gyrus and anterior temporal lobes [ ]. \n\nPostlexical output is the production stage, in which phonological representations are mapped to motor representations and speech occurs. Some dual-stream models assign this stage to the dorsal stream, in that the phonological representations in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) are mapped to motor sequence representations in the temporoparietal junction and posterior inferior frontal lobes [ ]. \n\n\n### 1.3. Design of This Experiment \n  \nWe tested these three predictions of the interhemispheric inhibition model in a cross-sectional study of people with chronic aphasia following left hemisphere stroke. The experiment used an fMRI task to isolate covert (phonological retrieval) and overt (postlexical output) phases of picture naming; we first examined the general patterns of activity in our aphasia group compared to matched controls and the relationship between activity and overall lesion size. We then used the activity in the control group to define the normal brain network for naming in older people without language impairment or brain injury and tested how lesions at key nodes in this network affected activity throughout the rest of the brain, in particular within the remaining bilateral language sites. The goal of the study was to examine whether plastic changes in chronic aphasia would be related to the size and site of the lesion, with particular interest in right hemisphere plasticity occurring in regions that were homotopic to the left hemisphere lesions. We further tested whether any changes in activity associated with lesion site were related to naming performance, in order to assess whether these regions are successfully adapting to support language function or are inhibiting successful recovery. \n\n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nForty-nine chronic left hemisphere stroke survivors with a history of aphasia were recruited. Ten participants were then excluded based on fMRI task performance (<10% accuracy) resulting in a final sample of 39 participants in the aphasia group. \n\nAll participants in the aphasia group were native English speakers and testing occurred at least six months after their stroke (mean chronicity = 52.9 months). Participants were screened based on ability to follow testing instructions and had no history of other significant neurological illnesses. The distribution of lesions and individual demographic information for the aphasia group can be found in the Supplementary Material available online at  . \n\nThirty-seven healthy control subjects, with no neurologic or psychiatric disorders, were also tested. Participants in the control group were matched to the aphasia group on age (  t  (67.5) = \u22120.42,   P   > 0.60), sex (  \u03c7  (1) = 0.79,   P   > 0.30), education (  t  (73.0) = 0.85,   P   > 0.30), and handedness (  \u03c7  (3) = 3.1,   P   > 0.30). Group means can be found in  . \n\nThe study was approved by the Georgetown University Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants prior to enrollment in the study. \n\n\n### 2.2. Experimental Design \n  \nVisual stimuli consisted of 54 line drawings, with 92\u2013100% name agreement based on norming in an independent sample of 55 older controls, representing one-, two-, and three-syllable words. To reduce individual differences in in-scanner performance, participants were presented with one of two 32-item sets during scanning based on the severity of their deficits. Fourteen participants whose naming and repetition deficits were severe in pre-MRI testing were given 32 one- and two-syllable items, while all other participants, including controls, were given 32 two- and three-syllable items during scanning. The one-syllable words also had overall higher frequency than the three-syllable words. \n\nThe fMRI task followed a slow jittered event related design. The trials were presented in a pseudo-randomized order. The task was a delayed naming task, which allows for the independent analysis of name retrieval and name production [ ]. First, a single line drawing appeared centered on the screen, surrounded by a red border. This image remained on the screen for 7500\u20139000\u2009ms, during which time the participant named the object in the image silently (covert naming). Then, the border around the image changed from red to green and remained on screen for 5500\u2009ms. During this time, the participant was asked to produce the name of the object aloud (overt naming). Finally, the line drawing and the surrounding box disappeared and the participant fixated on a crosshair for 14000\u2009ms. A slow event related design was chosen to allow for wash out of the hemodynamic response, which may be slower in stroke survivors [ ]. Images were presented using E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Pittsburg, PA), and responses were recorded using a MRI safe microphone (Opto-acoustics, FOMRI-III). Before the scan, participants practiced the task on images not included in the fMRI task. If a participant produced the correct name at any point during the overt naming period, the item was counted as correct. Only trials in which the correct response was produced during the overt phase were included in the analysis. If a participant made an incorrect or no response during the overt naming phase of the trial, the entire trial (both covert and overt phases) was removed from further analysis. \n\nNaming ability was tested using a 60-item version of the Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT) [ ], made up of items independent of those used in the scanning task. Testing took place within one week of the MRI scan. We counted the total number of items on the PNT that were named correctly on the first attempt. \n\n\n### 2.3. Scanning Parameters and Preprocessing \n  \nMRI data were collected on a 3.0 T Siemens Trio Scanner at the Georgetown University Medical Center. A high resolution T1-weighted MPRAGE was collected with the following parameters: repetition time = 1900\u2009ms, echo time = 2.56\u2009ms, flip angle = 9\u00b0, 160 contiguous 1\u2009mm slices, field of view = 250 \u00d7 250\u2009mm, matrix size = 246 \u00d7 256, and voxel size = 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1\u2009mm. Functional T2 -weighted images were acquired using a gradient-echo echo-planar pulse sequence, with the following parameters: repetition time = 2000\u2009ms, echo time = 30\u2009ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, 38 contiguous 3.2\u2009mm slices, field of view = 250 \u00d7 250\u2009mm, and voxel size = 3.2 \u00d7 3.2 \u00d7 3.2\u2009mm. The functional scan consisted of 32 trials, including an opening and closing screen, totaling approximately 15 minutes. \n\nLesion masks were created by manually tracing stroke damage on the T1-weighted images, in native space, in MRIcron [ ], following a preestablished set of guidelines for determining lesion borders. Ventricular expansion was not included in the lesion. All lesion masks were checked by two board certified neurologists (Shihui Xing and Peter E. Turkeltaub) after the tracing and again after the lesion masks were warped to the template. \n\nfMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using FSL 5.0.6 [ ]. Preprocessing included application of a high pass temporal filter, standard correction for head motion using MCFLIRT, interleaved slice timing correction, intensity normalization across volumes, and spatial smoothing to 5\u2009mm FWHM. Registration and normalization were carried out to the MNI standardized brain provided by FSL. For each condition in each trial, a canonical double-gamma hemodynamic response function was constructed for the duration of the event. Motion parameters were then included as covariates in the model. \n\n\n### 2.4. fMRI Analysis \n  \nFirst, we examined where participants in the aphasia group over- and underactivated relative to controls during covert and overt naming. In between-group contrasts, only areas that were significantly active (  z   > 2.3) in the aphasia group were included in the aphasia > control contrast, and vice versa. All whole-brain analyses were examined at cluster corrected   P   < 0.01, after a grey matter mask was applied. \n\n#### 2.4.1. Effects of Lesion Volume on Activity \n  \nWe tested whether right hemisphere activity in people with aphasia is driven by the extent of overall damage in the left hemisphere. To do this, we quantified the size of the lesion, warped to template, for each individual. Lesion size was measured in mm  after warping to a standardized template and then entered as a voxelwise continuous predictor variable in a group analysis. Clusters identified as significant in this analysis are areas where activation, for either covert or overt naming, differed as a function of lesion size. \n\n\n#### 2.4.2. Regions of Interest Used to Examine Remapping \n  \nIn order to examine how lesions within the normal language network affect naming ability, we identified regions of interest (ROIs) using the within-group contrasts from the control group. The peak voxel in each active cluster was identified, excluding primary visual cortex, for both the covert > fixation and overt > fixation contrasts. Then, 5\u2009mm spheres were drawn around the peak voxel. \n\nFor each of the left hemisphere ROIs, aphasia group participants were grouped based on lesion status at the ROI. As these were very small ROIs, not large clusters, the distributions of percent lesions in the ROIs were highly bimodal, so an all or nothing approach was used: If a participant had a lesion that overlapped with the ROI in even one voxel, the participant was counted in the \u201clesion\u201d group for that ROI. Then we tested whether lesions at each left hemisphere site led to worse naming performance on the PNT. Whole-brain analyses were then carried out, contrasting activity in these two groups (lesion versus intact at ROI site) of people with aphasia, while controlling for overall lesion volume. \n\nFinally, we examined more closely the relationships between damage in sites normally active in controls and activity in the remaining nodes in the network. Regressions were carried out which tested whether lesion status in a left hemisphere ROI predicted activity levels in each of the other left and right hemisphere ROIs, controlling for lesion volume. ROIs in which activity was modulated by lesion status at another site were then further tested to see whether activity in that area related to naming ability. \n\n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Whole-Brain Activity during Covert and Overt Naming \n  \nIn the covert > fixation contrast ( , Figures  - ), the aphasia group showed greater activity than the control group mostly in bilateral basal ganglia, bilateral cerebellum, but also the right ventral central sulcus and right IFG. The aphasia group underactivated the left frontal pole, cingulate cortex, and bilateral clusters in the superior frontal gyrus compared to controls. In within-group contrasts, both groups showed significant activation in the visual cortex. The control group showed bilateral activation in the inferior parietal sulcus (IPS), while the aphasia group only showed significant activation in the right IPS. Likewise, the control group showed activation in the bilateral insula and pars opercularis (POp), as well as left PTr, while the aphasia group only activated the right PTr. \n\nDuring overt naming ( , Figures  - ), the aphasia group overactivated dorsal regions bilaterally, in particular bilateral central sulcus, as well as right insula, right angular gyrus, and right Heschl's gyrus. The aphasia group underactivated, relative to controls, the left IFG, insula, superior temporal gyrus (STG), and cerebellum. In the within-group contrasts, both the aphasia group and control group activated the right superior temporal sulcus (STS), STG, temporal pole, and central sulcus. Only the control group activated these regions in the left hemisphere, while only the aphasia group showed activity in the right IFG. \n\n\n### 3.2. Effect of Lesion Size on Activity \n  \nNext, we looked for regions, within the aphasia group, where activity during covert and overt naming was predicted by large lesions ( ,  ). During covert naming, larger lesion size predicted widespread right hemisphere activity, especially in the central sulcus, POp, and PTr, but also in bilateral visual cortex, cingulate, IPS, and basal ganglia. During overt naming, larger lesion size predicted activation in bilateral central sulcus, cingulate, and cerebellum, but activity was heavily right lateralized, especially in right PTr, posterior STS, and posterior STG. \n\nWe also looked for regions where activity was greater in participants with smaller lesions. There were no areas where activity was significantly predicted by smaller lesions at our threshold. \n\n\n### 3.3. Lesions at ROIs and Behavior \n  \nRegions of interest were drawn based on peaks from the control group maps ( ). For covert naming, ROIs included the left and right IPS, left and right insula, and a left dorsal POp peak. Another peak in the left cingulate met requirements for an ROI, but only one participant in the aphasia group had a lesion in this area, so it was removed from further analysis. For overt naming, ROIs were selected in both the left and right motor cortex and STS. \n\nWe then tested whether lesion statuses in the left ROIs were related to naming performance in the scanner, using linear regression. Lesions in the left insula were related to worse naming,   t  (37) = \u22122.4,   P   < 0.05, but this effect did not hold when lesion size was introduced as a control variable,   P   > 0.30. Lesions in the left insula, dorsal POp, motor cortex, and STS had no relationship with naming performance in the scanner. \n\n\n### 3.4. Effect of Lesion Location on Remapping and Whole-Brain Analysis \n  \nWe then carried out whole-volume analysis using the aphasia group, testing whether lesion status at each left hemisphere ROI resulted in different patterns of activity in the rest of the brain, with lesion volume added as a nuisance variable. For covert naming, at a cluster corrected   P   < 0.01, there was no difference between people with left IPS lesions versus those without lesions at the IPS site. \n\nPeople with left insula lesions showed less activity in the right middle and inferior frontal gyri, with peaks in the right middle frontal gyrus and right dorsal PTr. Participants with left POp lesions also showed less activation in nearly overlapping regions, including right dorsal POp ( ,  ). The similarity of these results is likely due to the significant overlap between participants with left insula lesions and participants with left POp lesions. \n\nWe then took the cortical peak in this right hemisphere cluster, located in dorsal PTr, and extracted the activation levels for covert naming relative to baseline. The activation level in each participant with aphasia was transformed into a   z  -score centered on the control group mean. We carried out two tests, to examine whether activity in this area was related to PNT score, in the group with left POp lesions (  N   = 16) and in the group with intact left POp (  N   = 23), again controlling lesion size. There was no significant relationship between activity in the right peak activation and naming in either group (both   P  's > 0.25). The same analyses were also done, dividing participants based on lesion status at left insula (intact   N   = 21, lesion   N   = 18), but again no relationship was found for either group (both   P  's > 0.80). \n\nNo group differences in activity in the whole-volume analysis were identified based on lesion status at the two left hemisphere overt naming ROIs, left motor cortex and left STS, at this threshold. \n\n\n### 3.5. Effect of Lesion Status in One ROI on Activity in Other ROIs \n  \nFinally, we tested whether lesion status in each left hemisphere ROI affected activity levels in all other, left and right hemisphere, ROIs derived from the healthy control sample, controlling for lesion size. \n\nFor covert naming, only one relationship was marginally significant. Participants with left insula lesions had marginally greater activity in the left POp, but this effect was unreliable at   P   = 0.07. \n\nFor overt naming, lesions in the left motor cortex were related to significantly greater activity in the right motor cortex,   t  (36) = 2.91,   P   < 0.01, while lesions in the left STS were associated with lower activity in right motor cortex,   t  (36) = \u22122.24,   P   < 0.05 ( ). \n\nWe then tested whether right motor cortex over- or underactivation predicted naming performance in people with and without left motor lesions. As with the IFG analysis above, we calculated   z  -scores for activity in participants with aphasia, centered on the control group mean. For participants in the aphasia group with intact left motor cortex (  N   = 15), there was no relationship between right motor activity and naming,   t  (12) = \u22120.28,   P   = 0.75. However, for participants with left motor lesions (  N   = 24), right motor activity was positively associated with naming,   t  (21) = 3.67,   P   = 0.001. \n\n\n\n## 4. General Discussion \n  \nThis study addressed the relationship between stroke distribution and naming activity in chronic left hemisphere stroke survivors. Specifically, we examined whether overall size of the lesion, and damage of different nodes in the normal naming network, results in different patterns of brain activity. The analysis approach allowed us to test several current hypotheses regarding poststroke plasticity in language networks. Overall, the results support the prevalent notion that larger strokes result in greater usage of right hemisphere areas and further demonstrate that damage to different left hemisphere language nodes results in different patterns of activity in surviving nodes. The specific results, however, present challenges for the interhemispheric inhibition model and suggest that other mechanisms of behavioral and biological plasticity might better account for the data. \n\n### 4.1. Residual Left Hemisphere Language Activity and Perilesional Recruitment \n  \nA striking finding from the overall group analysis was a failure of people with aphasia to activate normal left hemisphere brain areas associated with speech production, including the ventral sensorimotor cortex and the superior temporal cortex [ ], during overt naming. These areas were robustly activated by the control group but not the group with aphasia, a difference confirmed in the direct between-group comparison. This finding cannot be related to direct lesion damage to these areas, as lesioned voxels were excluded from the analysis on a person-by-person basis. Rather, this pattern suggests a failure to activate spared left hemisphere speech production areas due to lesions elsewhere in the network. This explanation was not clearly supported by the ROI analysis, however, in which lesions in left hemisphere overt naming nodes did not relate to decreased activity in other spared left hemisphere nodes. Of note, because the ROIs were based on peak locations of activity in the control group, they were all located in the grey matter. It is possible the decreased activity observed in normal left hemisphere speech areas was primarily driven by disconnection from other network nodes due to white matter damage, which was not examined here. Regardless, the failure to activate normal left hemisphere areas involved in naming begs the question of whether and where compensation might be occurring in spared brain areas. \n\nOne prominent idea regarding poststroke language network plasticity proposes that left hemisphere perilesional areas surrounding the stroke that were previously involved in other functions are recruited into the language network to compensate for loss of language nodes [ ]. In our voxelwise analysis, we found only weak evidence for these effects, with small areas of increased activity relative to controls in left dorsal frontal cortex during overt naming. We note that the analysis may not have been sensitive to these effects due to variability in stroke distributions. In the more sensitive ROI analysis, we found that lesions in the left insula were associated with marginally higher covert naming activity levels in the left dorsal POp, but this effect was weak and difficult to interpret given how few of our participants had one of these nodes lesioned and the other intact. Overall, this study provides little evidence either for or against perilesional compensation. \n\n\n### 4.2. Lesion Size and Right Hemisphere Recruitment \n  \nAnother prominent mode of proposed reorganization after stroke is the recruitment of homotopic areas in the right hemisphere. It has frequently been suggested that overall lesion size in the left hemisphere may relate to right hemisphere recruitment [ ,  ,  ]. This proposed relationship is sometimes based on the interhemispheric inhibition model, even though a relationship between lesion size and contralesional recruitment is not supported by animal models, in which small sensorimotor lesions result in an increase in synaptogenesis and astrocytic volume contralateral to the stroke, while large lesions result in decreases in both of these measures, likely due to denervation-induced atrophy [ ]. Alternatively, the proposed relationship between lesion size and right hemisphere engagement is sometimes based on the logical argument that people with relatively small lesions have sufficient viable left hemisphere tissue to support language and may not require right hemisphere compensation, whereas people with large lesions have little viable left hemisphere tissue and must rely on the right hemisphere to a greater extent. Although a positive relationship between lesion size and right hemisphere recruitment is frequently discussed in the literature, there is surprisingly little direct empirical evidence of this relationship. One prior study examined the laterality indices of eight people with aphasia and found that large lesions were associated with greater right than left hemisphere activation during picture naming but not during a semantic decision task [ ]. Here, we present strong support for this effect in both covert and overt naming in a large sample. Participants with larger lesions showed greater activity in right hemisphere areas homotopic to the normal left hemisphere language network. Notably, for overt naming, the specific pattern of activity related to lesion size in the right hemisphere ( ) closely mirrored the pattern of decreased activity relative to controls in the left hemisphere ( ). \n\nThe mechanisms underlying the increased activation of the right hemisphere in people with large lesions are unclear. This effect may not reflect plasticity at all but rather the increased effort required for language tasks by people with larger lesions. It is not unusual for more difficult tasks to elicit greater activity throughout the brain, including homotopic right hemisphere areas for language tasks [ ]. Participants with large lesions likely exert greater effort in retrieving and producing the names of items and thus show overactivation during the task. Notably, activity in the bilateral visual cortex was also related to lesion size during both covert and overt naming here, suggesting that greater activity in general may be related to greater effort and longer looking times. Like other recent studies, we restricted our analysis to correct trials only in part to minimize these effort effects. However, even when producing a correct naming response, it is likely the people with large lesions may expend more effort than those with small lesions. \n\nSimilarly, it has recently been proposed that some right hemisphere overactivation observed in aphasia could be explained by recruitment of domain general attentional systems [ ,  ] rather than language system reorganization per se. As above, the right hemisphere activity may similarly relate to the overall greater difficulty of language tasks for people with aphasia, although, under this hypothesis, the right hemisphere activity does not contribute to computations specific to language at all. Although this may explain part of the effect, we think it is unlikely to explain all right hemisphere overactivation in aphasia, given evidence here and elsewhere that activation of some right hemisphere nodes relates to the location of damage in the left and that the tasks that activate specific right hemisphere nodes are the same as those that activate the homotopic left hemisphere nodes in healthy controls [ ]. \n\nAlternatively, explicit or implicit strategies used to compensate for deficits may result in recruitment of brain networks not used by healthy controls for language tasks, including the right hemisphere. As in the proposed overreliance on domain general systems, activity related to use of these strategies during scanning would not reflect any true plasticity in the language network. However, ultimately, reliance on domain general resources or alternate strategies in the long term could reinforce new neuronal connections and result in permanent neuroplastic changes in the network. In this case, differential activity could be observed even if the person does not actively use any alternate strategies during scanning. Melodic intonation therapy provides a clear example of an explicit compensatory strategy that can induce long lasting changes in network structure [ ]. However, compensatory strategies need not be directly related to specific therapeutic experiences. For instance, a person who fails to retrieve the phonology of a word may attempt to visualize its spelling without any therapeutic training to do so. Changes in brain organization related to these type of strategic shifts may or may not relate to lesion size and location. For example, compensatory strategies involving pragmatic aspects of language or alternate forms of communication might be most used by people with large lesions and severe aphasia, potentially resulting in a relationship between lesion size and remodeling in brain areas involved in these functions. In the example of melodic intonation therapy, people with large frontal lesions causing nonfluent aphasias are most likely to receive this type of treatment [ ], so this bias in exposure to intonation-based treatment could result in a relationship between left frontal strokes and right hemisphere changes that are behaviorally, rather than neurobiologically, driven. Spontaneous strategies such as mental visualization of word spellings could similarly relate to lesion location, assuming specific stroke distributions give rise to a pattern of deficits and preserved abilities that make these strategies advantageous. Importantly, however, reorganization related to strategic shifts should not necessarily occur in areas that are homotopic to the lesion. \n\n\n### 4.3. Remapping in Homotopic Nodes \n  \nIn contrast to the types of behaviorally driven plasticity described above, some neuroplasticity after stroke may occur as a direct biological result of the stroke itself. The interhemispheric inhibition model is the most prominent theory of biologically driven plasticity in the intact hemisphere after stroke. One prediction of this model is that remapping into the right hemisphere in aphasia should be homotopic to the lesion and not only driven by an overall lack of remaining left hemisphere tissue. A second predication is that as right hemisphere regions inhibit the remaining left hemisphere tissue, activity in the right should be associated with worse performance. \n\nContrary to this hypothesis, we found that lesions in the left POp and insula led to robustly decreased covert naming activity in the right PTr and in the MFG just dorsal to the POp, even when controlling for lesion volume. Furthermore, activity in this right frontal region was not related to naming ability. This finding also stands in contrast to a recent meta-analysis showing, across many studies using various language tasks, people with left IFG lesions were more likely to activate the right IFG [ ]. There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, the right hemisphere activity here is not perfectly homotopic with the lesioned nodes, although the difference in location, compared to the dorsal POp node, is very small. Second, we did not account for the proportion of the region affected by stroke. Greater right IFG activity might be more likely in people with a greater proportion of the left IFG damaged, while we treated all participants with lesions at the left insula (or POp) site as one group. However, a recent study using a semantic task found no relationship between proportion of intact left IFG and right IFG activity [ ], and as noted above, the animal literature shows that larger lesions can be associated with atrophy of contralateral cortex, rather than enhanced plasticity [ ], corresponding with our findings here. Second, our study controlled for total lesion volume, which is rarely done in fMRI studies of aphasia, particularly in case studies or case series with few participants. It is likely that increased right IFG activity in prior studies is related to large lesions that include the left IFG and not specifically to lesions in the left IFG themselves. In support of this explanation,   demonstrates that increased total lesion volume is associated with increased right IFG activity, among other areas. Finally, our study excluded participants with severe anomia, who could not correctly name at least 10% of the trials in the scanner. Other studies involving more severe patients, especially those that do not isolate activity related exclusively to correct trials, might reasonably produce a different result in the IFG. Therefore, questions for future study include whether homotopic remapping in the inferior frontal lobes is more likely in people with more severe aphasia and is related primarily to erroneous responses, as has previously been suggested in a small case series [ ]. \n\nWe did find evidence for homotopic remapping in motor cortex, in that left motor cortex lesions led to significantly greater right motor cortex activation during overt naming, controlling for total lesion volume. However, in contrast to the predictions of the interhemispheric inhibition model, overactivation of right motor cortex was associated with better naming performance in people with left motor lesions. These results join a growing body of literature suggesting that the right hemisphere may play a largely compensatory role, even in chronic stages of aphasia. Evidence for this begins in neuropsychological case studies, which have identified people who had recovered at least partially from aphasia following left hemisphere stroke and then redeveloped aphasia after a later right hemisphere disruption, whether due to intracarotid amobarbital injection or a second stroke [ \u2013 ]. These studies suggest that the right hemisphere can, to some degree, take over the language functions that the left hemisphere can no longer perform. A recent structural study found that greater grey matter volume in the right temporoparietal cortex related to better language production outcomes in chronic aphasia [ ]. Other neuroimaging studies have shown positive relationships between right hemisphere activation and various language outcomes, supporting right hemisphere compensation [ \u2013 ]. Based on performance decrements after inhibitory TMS, other studies have also suggested that right hemisphere areas may be involved to some degree in phonology and naming in healthy people [ ,  ]. Damage to left hemisphere language nodes may thus result in increased reliance on these right hemisphere language processors [ ]. However, this explanation cannot account for the effects observed here, since the activity in right motor cortex related to naming performance only in people with left motor cortex lesions. This pattern strongly suggests a true compensatory relationship in which the right hemisphere node \u201ctakes over\u201d for the corresponding lesioned left hemisphere area and demonstrates that specific biological mechanisms of plasticity beyond the interhemispheric inhibition model must be considered. \n\n\n### 4.4. Alternate Biological Mechanisms of Right Hemisphere Recruitment \n  \nIf not interhemispheric inhibition, what biological mechanism might explain recruitment of a homotopic node in the right hemisphere? The first possibility is that the interhemispheric inhibition hypothesis may be partially correct. It is possible that right hemisphere homotopic recruitment does result from transcallosal disinhibition but that this overactivation does not significantly suppress the surviving left hemisphere tissue. Behaviorally important right-to-left inhibition may simply never occur in language systems, may be restricted to particular areas such as the PTr, or may occur only in the case of relatively small lesions with some nearly homotopic left hemisphere tissue remaining to be inhibited [ ]. \n\nHowever, other biological mechanisms might better explain compensatory recruitment of homotopic areas in the spared hemisphere after stroke. It has previously been noted that right hemisphere activity is maximal several weeks after a stroke causing aphasia [ ]. If this activity resulted from direct disinhibition, the right hemisphere activity should occur immediately after the stroke. This kind of immediate right hemisphere recruitment has been observed after TMS-induced transient lesions [ ,  ], but not after stroke. The gradual development of right hemisphere activation after stroke instead suggests a slower process, possibly relying on structural plasticity rather than a direct electrophysiological effect. \n\nWe suggest that axonal collateral sprouting from surviving neurons may provide an alternative neurobiological mechanism to explain both perilesional left hemisphere and homotopic right hemisphere recruitment in aphasia. This model is based on the principle that if two neurons send axons to the same target, they compete for synapses at the target. If one neuron dies, its axon degenerates and the surviving neuron's axon sprouts new collaterals near the target to take over empty synapses. Axonal collateral sprouting is observed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, for instance, in the development of ocular dominance columns and the delineation of motor units at the neuromuscular junction. It is known to play a role in reorganization after spinal cord injury [ ] and brain injury, including stroke [ ]. Competition has been shown to guide axonal sprouting in the sensory-motor spinal circuits in adult rats [ ], and unbalanced endogenous activity dramatically affects receptor targeting in tracts crossing the corpus callosum [ ]. Although not the only mechanism that can explain \u201ctake over\u201d of prior functions by new brain areas, axonal collateral sprouting has previously been demonstrated to account for this phenomenon. For example, when dorsal route fibers to the hippocampus are destroyed in rats, ventral route fibers take over these connections over a period of months resulting in ultimate recovery of innervation patterns [ ]. Further, axonal collateral sprouting is altered by the experience of the organism [ ], providing a specific biological mechanism for function and neuroanatomic changes induced by speech-language therapy in people with aphasia. \n\nUnder this hypothesis, spared brain regions that share axonal targets with the lesioned tissue are the most likely to be recruited after stroke. This suggests that areas engaged to compensate might be predictable based on coconnectivity patterns before the stroke. Neighboring neurons are likely to share axonal targets, thus providing a basis for perilesional recruitment in the case of relatively small lesions. In some cases, such as motor areas innervating proximal limb muscles and the tongue, the homotopic cortex in the intact hemisphere likely shares axonal projection targets with the lesioned neurons and can take over the lost synapses, resulting in functional recovery [ ,  ]. \n\nOur findings were near the mouth areas of motor cortex, and this mechanism might explain our findings of right hemisphere mouth-area motor recruitment during overt but not covert naming, corresponding with better naming performance specifically when the left hemisphere mouth area of motor cortex is lesioned. However, motor cortex has also been shown in other neuroimaging studies to play a role in covert naming and prearticulatory processes [ ]. Furthermore, Geranmayeh and colleagues have argued that, regardless of the role of motor cortex in healthy people, upregulation of the region in people with aphasia is a marker of increased demands on domain general systems such as cognitive control and attention [ ], and the relationship between activity and recovery is more related to those processes than anything language specific. It is possible that the diverse, nonspecific role of the motor cortex in speech production may also prime it to be uniquely plastic and available for taking over cognitive function through axonal sprouting, when the homotopic region is lesioned. \n\nRegardless of the specific role of each region, the broader pattern of right hemisphere recruitment may result from a cascading effect from one homotopic right hemisphere node taking over synapses from its left hemisphere counterpart at a shared axonal target. When this node takes over the function of the lesioned left hemisphere node, the entire right hemisphere network connected to this one node may become involved in compensation, at least to a degree, resulting in broad patterns of increased activity. Alternatively, homotopic areas of each hemisphere's association cortices may share common cortical and subcortical axonal projection targets, and synaptic competition may account directly for broad patterns of right hemisphere recruitment. Modern connectomics may help to test these ideas. If supported by additional data, this hypothesis may provide clear predictions regarding the availability and location of alternate processing nodes based on the specific anatomical structures damaged by an individual's stroke. \n\n\n### 4.5. Limitations and Future Directions \n  \nOne unexpected finding was that while both people with aphasia and controls showed widespread activity during both covert and overt naming, the differences between the two groups was more widespread during overt naming. Most strikingly, the temporal lobe, in particular the STS and STG, was not significantly active in either group during covert naming. The posterior STS and STG are involved in phonological processes, which can include phonological retrieval [ ], verbal working memory [ ], and a sensorimotor speech interface for speech productions [ ], so it was expected to be active during the covert naming phase of the experiment. In our experiment, however, no response was collected during the covert naming phase. If a trial was answered incorrectly during overt naming, both the covert and overt naming phases were removed from analysis. But, we do not have any measurable evidence of what was occurring for each participant during the covert naming phase. It is possible that some participants were less engaged in the task and only really attempted to name the object when cued to make an overt response and thus did not activate articulatory regions during the covert naming phase. In general, the use of a low-level control condition in the fMRI task allowed us to identify activity for word retrieval and production broadly but prohibited a detailed accounting of the precise nature of the processing in any given area of activity. \n\nIn this study, we identified regions where plasticity was dependent on the site of the lesion in left frontal and motor tissue. However, it remains unclear whether these relationships are mediated by the degree to which critical areas for naming are damaged or preserved. The language network in the left hemisphere involves many regions which are critical for different aspects of language. The degree to which a critical area for naming is destroyed by the stroke may determine whether plasticity of naming function is even possible, regardless of the lesion status at other regions of interest such as motor or inferior frontal cortex. A goal of future research is to identify regions in which damage has a catastrophic effect on naming ability and then model how damage in these regions affects others in the system, both perilesional and homotopic. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nIn this study we tested three central hypotheses of the interhemispheric inhibition model. We found an overall greater rightward shift of activity dependent on lesion size. Taking this overall effect into account, specific patterns of right hemisphere plasticity depended on the specific location of the stroke. Furthermore, right motor activation was positively associated with naming ability but only in people with left motor lesions. This finding suggests that lesion site needs to be accounted for when considering both the cause of right hemisphere overactivation and the role of right hemisphere activity, in people with aphasia. It is unlikely that any single biological mechanism explains all aspects of poststroke reorganization, and as noted above, complex interactions between biology and the environment are expected. We suggest that future work on aphasia recovery should be guided by specific behavioral and biological hypotheses that lead to specific experimental predictions for brain imaging and stimulation studies. Interhemispheric inhibition is one such specific biological hypothesis, but it cannot account for the entire range of observed neuroplastic effects in aphasia. The field must begin to entertain equally specific alternate hypotheses, such as synaptic competition, in order to move forward. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tAphasia group\tControl group\nAge (years)\t59.8 (10.1)\t58.7 (13.2)\nSex (male/female)\t26/13\t20/17\nEducation (years)\t16.4 (2.8)\t16.9 (2.6)\nHandedness (right/left/ambidextrous/unknown)\t33/4/0/4\t33/3/1/0\nTime since stroke (months)\t52.9 (51.4)\t\u2014\nWAB naming/word finding\t7.1 (2.5)\t\u2014\nWAB auditory-verbal comprehension\t8.3 (1.5)\t\u2014\nWAB repetition\t7.0 (2.5)\t\u2014\nWAB spontaneous speech\t15.1 (4.9)\t\u2014\n### Caption\nDemographic information for the aphasia group and control group.

Although aberrant brain development has long been theorized as a characteristic feature of ASD, the neural substrates have been difficult to characterize, in part due to a lack of developmental data and to performance confounds. To address these issues, we examined the development of intrinsic functional connectivity, with resting state fMRI from late childhood to early adulthood (8\u201336 years), using a seed based functional connectivity method with the striatal regions. Overall, we found that both groups show decreases in cortico-striatal circuits over age. However, when controlling for age, ASD participants showed increased connectivity with parietal cortex and decreased connectivity with prefrontal cortex relative to typically developed (TD) participants. In addition, ASD participants showed aberrant age-related connectivity with anterior aspects of cerebellum, and posterior temporal regions (e.g., fusiform gyrus, inferior and superior temporal gyri). In sum, we found prominent differences in the development of striatal connectivity in ASD, most notably, atypical development of connectivity in striatal networks that may underlie cognitive and social reward processing. Our findings highlight the need to identify the biological mechanisms of perturbations in brain reorganization over development, which may also help clarify discrepant findings in the literature. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA recent focus in autism research is the differences in functional connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Early studies suggested that functional connectivity was altered in ASD during tasks examining executive function (Koshino et al.,  ,  ; Just et al.,  ; Mostofsky et al.,  ), language (Just et al.,  ; Kana et al.,  ), face processing (Kleinhans et al.,  ), social-emotion processing (Welchew et al.,  ; Rudie et al.,  ), selective attention (Keehn et al.,  ), and visuomotor coordination (Mizuno et al.,  ; Mostofsky et al.,  ). These findings have led to the strong hypothesis that ASD is a \u201cdisorder of abnormal brain connectivity\u201d (Belmonte et al.,  ; Frith,  ; Just et al.,  ; Geschwind and Levitt,  ; Hughes,  ; Minshew and Williams,  ; Ecker et al.,  ), with the predominant theory being that hypo-connectivity, was core to the pathophysiology of the disorder. However, results from task-related functional connectivity studies have been mixed as reports indicate both hypo- and hyper- functional connectivity in ASD relative to typically developing (TD) individuals (Muller et al.,  ). \n\nExamining resting state functional connectivity may help address some of the discrepant findings, as it provides a measure of intrinsic functional connectivity without the task-related differences that confound comparisons across different age and clinical groups. However, similar to the task-based literature, much of the prior resting state connectivity research testing individuals with ASD has suggested overall decreases in intrinsic connectivity (Cherkassky et al.,  ; Kennedy and Courchesne,  ; Monk et al.,  ; Assaf et al.,  ; Jones et al.,  ; Weng et al.,  ; Anderson et al.,  ; Dinstein et al.,  ; Ebisch et al.,  ; Gotts et al.,  ; Rudie et al.,  ; Mueller et al.,  ; Tyszka et al.,  ; von dem Hagen et al.,  ), while some others have found increases (Noonan et al.,  ; Di Martino et al.,  ; Delmonte et al.,  ; Lynch et al.,  ; Uddin et al.,  ; Washington et al.,  ). Taken together, these findings suggest that the nature of connectivity differences in ASD is not yet fully characterized. Inconsistent findings in functional connectivity might be due to many important differences between various studies (e.g., data acquisition and analysis, small sample sizes, diagnostic criteria). It is especially likely that differences in age ranges and a lack of examination of developmental changes contribute to conflicting reports in the literature (for review, see Uddin et al.,  ). In general, developmental work in ASD is limited, with a few prior studies examining age-related change in gray matter (Langen et al.,  ; Greimel et al.,  ), structural connectivity (Kleinhans et al.,  ), behavior (Luna et al.,  ), task modulated brain function (Schulte-Ruther et al.,  ), and resting state connectivity with the default mode network (Wiggins et al.,  ). The majority of these studies report atypical trajectories in ASD. Given that (1) typical connectivity develops substantially, with connectivity patterns changing well into adulthood (Fair et al.,  ; Hwang and Luna,  ), (2) group differences may manifest differently at different time points over the lifespan, and (3) ASD is characterized as a disorder of abnormal and delayed development in the brain, there is a strong possibility that functional connectivity matures differently in ASD. Thus, examining age-related changes in brain connectivity is crucial to understanding the neural basis of ASD. Importantly, there is a need to clarify the nature of developmental change (Figure  ). For example, developmental abnormalities can be classified as arrested (a lack of development) (Figure  ), or atypical (a deviating developmental trajectory) (Figures  ). In addition, it is important to know if regions show intact development in ASD (Figure  ), or no developmental changes, but show persistent disorder effects (Figure  ). Characterizing these patterns is essential to understanding the progression of the disorder and for identifying time points of plasticity and/or vulnerabilities. \n  \n Schematic of predicted models of age-related change in ASD and TD  . The ASD group is depicted with dashed lines and the TD with solid lines.   (A)   Both groups display age-related change, but do not differ in trajectories suggesting intact development in ASD.   (B)   Stable disorder effects that persist over development, with no age-related changes.   (C)   TD group shows age-related change, but ASD group remains unchanged, suggesting a developmental arrest or delay.   (D)   Both groups display differential developmental trajectories that converge into adulthood (Equifinality).   (E,F)   Both groups display differential developmental trajectories that diverge in adulthood (Multifinality). \n  \nOne particularly understudied topic in the ASD literature is differences in connectivity with the striatum, an important subcortical region associated with a number of core cognitive and affective functions (Postuma and Dagher,  ) that are atypical in ASD-including social reward processing. The striatum, which includes the caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens bilaterally, has extensive connections to cortex and cerebellum via the thalamus. Prior studies of functional connectivity during rest in typical adults have revealed a number of functionally distinct but overlapping cortico-striatal circuits (Di Martino et al.,  ; Kelly et al.,  ; Furman et al.,  ) that underlie core motor, cognitive, affective, and reward processes. Important for the current study, neuroimaging research has found structural and functional differences in ASD in the striatum. Structural neuroimaging studies have shown differences in striatal volume in both children and adults with ASD, specifically in the caudate nucleus (Stanfield et al.,  ; Langen et al.,  ; Qiu et al.,  ; Estes et al.,  ). Functional neuroimaging studies demonstrate striatal activation differences in children, adolescents, and adults with ASD (in separate studies) during tasks of sensorimotor control and higher order cognition (Schmitz et al.,  ; Takarae et al.,  ; Shafritz et al.,  ), social processing (Dapretto et al.,  ; Masten et al.,  ; Weng et al.,  ; Delmonte et al.,  ), and reward processing (Scott-Van Zeeland et al.,  ; Delmonte et al.,  ). Diffusion tensor imaging studies have previously shown decreased white matter connectivity between striatum and prefrontal cortex ASD relative to TD (Langen et al.,  ) or no group differences in adults (Delmonte et al.,  ). With regards to functional connectivity with striatum, most prior research has suggested hyper-connectivity. For example, Turner et al. ( ) found increased and more diffuse functional connectivity between the caudate nucleus and cortical areas such as prefrontal cortex, premotor areas, and parietal cortex in adults with ASD during a task of visuomotor coordination. Di Martino et al. ( ) reported increased cortico-striatal resting state connectivity in children with ASD relative to TD children and TD adults, and Delmonte et al. ( ) showed increased resting state connectivity between striatum (specifically caudate and nucleus accumbens) and prefrontal cortex in adults during rest. Di Martino et al. ( ) also reported aberrant as well as increased cortico-striatal connectivity in ASD children relative to TD children and TD adults. These differences were widespread but included limbic regions such as the insula and face processing regions such as the superior temporal cortex. Another prior resting state study reported hypo-connectivity between the ventral striatum and the temporal lobe in children with ASD (Abrams et al.,  ). Taken together, these findings suggest that striatal connectivity is atypical in ASD, and may be predominantly characterized by hyperconnectivity with cortical areas. To date, no study has examined the development of striatal functional connectivity in ASD from childhood to adulthood. \n\nThe current study utilized resting state fMRI, expanding on previous work (Di Martino et al.,  ), to explore the development of the functional connectivity of the striatum in ASD and TD. We predicted that TD individuals would show decreasing cortico-striatal connectivity over development, consistent with previous literature (Supekar et al.,  ; Dosenbach et al.,  ). Given prior evidence of relative hyper-connectivity with striatum in both children and adults (Di Martino et al.,  ; Delmonte et al.,  ), we predicted that ASD individuals would overall show increased connectivity relative to typical individuals when controlling for age. We also predicted that ASD individuals would show both deviant and arrested development in connectivity with areas that change typically, especially with regions of the striatum known to support cognitive (dorsal caudate) and affective (ventral striatum) circuits, which may contribute to known behavioral impairments of the disorder. We did not have any directional hypotheses for age related differences in striatal connectivity between ASD and TD given the lack of prior developmental research in this area. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nForty-two ASD and 48 TD participants between the ages of 8 and 36 were tested. There were no differences in age (  p   = 0.88) and IQ (above 80;   p   = 0.81) between groups. Participants were recruited through the University of Pittsburgh Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) subject core (HD#055748). Participants were diagnosed with ASD using the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI; Lord et al.,  ) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-G (ADOS; Lord et al.,  ). Participants and/or their legal guardians provided consent and assent prior to being enrolled in the study, which was approved by the Internal Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh. The ASD group met cut-offs for autism on the ADI (except one individual in section D) and cut-offs for either autism or spectrum disorder on the ADOS, and an expert clinician confirmed diagnosis. Individuals were excluded from the ASD group if they reported concussions, vision problems, drug abuse, epilepsy, meningitis, and/or encephalitis. There were no effects of age on ADI scores or the ADOS social or final scores (  p  's > 0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons) though there was a significant effect of age on the ADOS communication score (  t   = 3.422,   p   = 0.002), increasing in severity with age. TD participants were recruited through the Autism Center for Excellence (Pittsburgh, PA) subject core. Exclusion criteria included learning disabilities and psychiatric disorders (individual and first-degree relative). All participants were screened for MR safety (absence of any metal and claustrophobia). See Table   for full description of participant demographics. \n  \n Demographic information  . \n  \nADOS, Autism Diagnosis Observation Schedule; ADI, Autism Diagnostic Interview; SD, Standard Deviation; ASD, Autism Spectrum Disorder; TD, Typical Development.

Participants first completed six runs of face and car memorization and recognition tasks. Next, we acquired Magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) and DTI sequences prior to the final resting state scan. The participants watched a movie of their choice during structural scans in order to reduce the potential for head movement. During the resting state scan, participants were instructed to lie in the scanner with their eyes closed but to remain awake. Functional images were obtained using a gradient echo, echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence sensitive to blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast (  TR   = 1500 ms,   TE   = 25 ms, flip angle = 70\u00b0, 29 4 mm slices axial slices, voxel size = 3.1 \u00d7 3.1 \u00d7 4, 200 volumes per run,   FOV   = 200 mm), interleaved slices MPRAGE sequences (  TR   = 2100 ms,   TE   = 3.93 ms, flip angle = 7\u00b0, 176 1 mm axial slices, voxel size = 1.1 \u00d7 1.1 \u00d7 1.1) were used to obtain structural images, prior to functional imaging. \n\n\n### fMRI preprocessing \n  \nEach participant's resting scan data were motion corrected using AFNI (Cox,  ), using the first volume as a reference. To correct for signal corrupted by physiological noise, Physiologic EStimation by Temporal Independent Component Analysis (PESTICA v2.0) (Beall and Lowe,  ) was used to create respiration and cardiac estimators, and apply impulse response function retrospective correction of physiological motion effects (IRF-RETROICOR) (Beall,  ). These estimates were then filtered temporally based on the empirically derived default windows of 48\u201385 bpm for cardiac and 10\u201324 bpm for respiration and adjusted for dithering. Resulting images were then slice time corrected, aligned to the MPRAGE using FLIRT in FSL (Smith et al.,  ) and, scaled to the mean of each voxel. We used Freesurfer's automated segmentation program (Fischl et al.,  ) to segment gray matter, white matter, ventricles and non-brain tissue (NBT) in each participant's MPRAGE scan. These anatomical parcellations were used to extract signal from white matter, ventricles and NBT in the resting state fMRI scans. Using measures of head movement obtained from motion correction, we averaged translation and rotation values in the x, y, and z directions to calculate root mean square (RMS) of linear and angular precision. Next, using the ANATICOR program in AFNI (Jo et al.,  ), we reduced noise and artifacts from hardware, the draining vessel effect, and motion in each gray matter voxel by regressing out the following nuisance variables: (1) motion regressors for the standard 6 parameters, (2) local white matter regressors averaged from white matter voxels within a spherical mask (radius = 30 mm) centered at each gray matter voxel of interest, (3) ventricle signal regressors, and (4) NBT regressors. There were no significant differences in head motion across age (  P   = 0.15) or between groups (  P   = 0.25). Data were subsequently bandpass filtered at 0.009 Hz < f < 0.08 Hz and voxels were spatially smoothed using a 5 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. Structural scans (MPRAGE) were warped to a standard template space using a template brain from the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI, Montreal, Canada) using FSL's non-linear registration procedure (FLIRT and FNIRT), and resulting warp coefficients were saved. Preprocessed fMRI data were spatially aligned and normalized to each participant's warped MPRAGE scan using FSL's non-linear registration procedure (FNIRT). Further, using the methods proposed by Power et al. ( ), we calculated frame-wise displacement (FD) and RMS variance of the temporal derivative of the time-series (DVARS). FD and DVARS values were used to identify volumes in the fMRI time series to remove from data analysis. There were no differences in FD between groups or across age (Figure  ) (  p  's > 0.05). Using the same threshold as Power et al. ( ) we removed volumes where FD exceeded 0.5 mm and DVARS exceeded 0.5% signal change. There were no significant differences between groups (  t   = 0.656,   p   = 0.513) or across age (  t   = \u22121.449,   p   = 0.151) for the number of volumes removed (TD: mean 26.08 \u00b1 10.02, ASD: mean 30.66 \u00b1 9.38). \n\n\n### Striatal volume analysis \n  \nGiven prior research suggesting that the structural development of the striatum differs in ASD relative to TD, we obtained volumetric measurements from the caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens, and the whole brain using Freesurfer's automated segmentation tool (Fischl et al.,  ). We entered these values into linear regression models with age and age  as continuous variables, and diagnosis as a categorical variable. We chose to model both linear and quadratic functions of age given prior evidence that striatal structures show both linear and quadratic changes over development (Langen et al.,  ). We also examined whether striatal volume differed as a function of age or diagnosis therefore potentially introducing a confound. We found no age or diagnosis, group main effects or interactions on striatal volume for any of the six striatal structures even at an uncorrected threshold of   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nWe used functionally distinct seed regions of interest (ROI) in striatum, bilaterally, including the dorsal caudate (DC), inferior and superior ventral striatum (VSi, VSs), dorsal-caudal and dorsal-rostral putamen (dcP, drP), and ventral rostral putamen (vrP) as previously defined in the literature (Di Martino et al.,  ) (Table  ). Prior research using these seed regions has demonstrated increased connectivity in ASD children relative to TD children and adults, suggesting that developmental differences might exist (Di Martino et al.,  ). Striatal ROI's were manually inspected against each participant's warped MPRAGE to ensure that they all fell within the boundaries of the striatal regions that they represented. In each participant's resting scan images, using single value decomposition in AFNI (1dSVD), we extracted the first principal component vector in the time series for each of the 12 ROIs using AFNI (Cox,  ). In order to ensure that the first component time series was the most representative of all of the voxels in the seed, we correlated this time series with the average time series of each seed. Across participants and across all seed ROI's, the correlation values were above   r   = 0.99. We then correlated each first component vector with time series in every voxel in the brain. Resulting whole brain correlation maps were Z-transformed (Fisher r to z transformation) and entered into group-level regression models with diagnosis (ASD, TD) as a categorical factor and age as a continuous factor, controlling for sex. We also ran regression analyses to examine any non-linear relationships with age, including a quadratic model of age (age ), given prior research suggesting that striatal volume in ASD showed both quadratic and linear change with age (Langen et al.,  ). We generated maps of regions that exhibited positive and negative connectivity for each seed as a function of age within group (ASD, TD) as well as age by group interactions. We used a group inclusive mask, masking for regions that overlapped across all participants (Figure  ). To correct for multiple comparisons (family-wise error correction), we ran a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine cluster size at a voxel threshold of   p   = 0.005, and a cluster threshold of   p   = 0.004. We chose the value for the cluster threshold based on a Bonferroni correction for multiple seed regions (  p   = 0.05/12 seeds = 0.004). \n  \n Coordinates for striatal seed regions in left and right hemisphere in MNI space  . \n  \nDC, Dorsal Caudate; dcP, dorsal caudal Putamen; drP, dorsal rostral Putamen; vrP, ventral rostral Putamen; VSi, Ventral Striatum inferior; VSs, Ventral Striatum superior. \n  \nFurthermore, as a secondary analysis, we excluded all participants over the age of 25, as we had fewer participants who exceeded this age, and reran the whole brain group analysis. We thus report resulting significant clusters that showed main effects of age or age , main effect of diagnosis group (controlling for age), and age by diagnosis group interaction, across all participants in regions that remained significant when we excluded participants over the age of 25 (in order to ensure that our age effects were not driven by the older participants). For the regions that showed an age by diagnosis interaction, average beta values were extracted for each individual and entered into linear regression models using the lm function in R (R Core Team,  ) to determine the direction of the developmental slope of each group. To assess the effect of autism diagnosis on connectivity, we ran separate regression models on the ASD group with age and ADI scores as independent variables (controlling for sex) in each of our resulting significant clusters. Lastly, given the recent discussions in the literature regarding the optimal methods of motion correction (e.g., Power et al.,  ; Satterthwaite et al.,  ), we reran our analyses without the motion censoring procedure and covaried FD at the group level. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nFor the analyses that included the quadratic function of age, we found no significant clusters. Therefore, all results reported below are based on regression models that included only linear relationships with age. We also did not find any significant effects of ADI scores on connectivity (all   p  's > 0.05). Lastly, we did not find differences in which clusters were significant when covarying FD at the group level. Therefore, we report our findings when employing the scrubbing procedure described previously. \n\nOur results were consistent with previous work on striatal connectivity and development. Collapsed across groups and age, we found patterns of positive correlations between the striatal seeds and a distributed set of cortical areas. Overall, connectivity patterns were similar to previously published research in TD adults (Di Martino et al.,  ) (Figures  ,  ). Independent of diagnostic group, we found decreases with age in connectivity between striatal seeds and a wide set of striatal and cortical regions including prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortices, and cerebellum (Figures  ,  ). Below, for each striatal seed, we first report clusters that showed a main effect of diagnosis group when controlling for age, to establish regions that show differences in ASD relative to TD overall (Figure  , Table  ). We then report clusters that showed significant group by age interactions (Figures  ,  , and Figure  , Table  ). \n  \n Statistical maps depicting linear effects of age with right hemisphere seeds  . For all analyses, we used a Monte Carlo simulation for cluster correction (voxel-wise   p   < 0.005, cluster-level   p   < 0.004 or 105 voxels) (AFNI; 3dClustSim).

See Figure   for all graphs. \n    \n Regions showing significant Age \u00d7 Diagnosis Group Interactions  . \n    \n### Dorsal caudate (DC) \n  \nThe DC has extensive connections with dorsal and lateral aspects of cortex involved in inhibitory control, working memory, and task switching. \n\nGroup differences: We found no group differences between the DC when controlling for age. \n\nWhole brain group \u00d7 age interaction: We found significant age by diagnosis interactions in connectivity between the left DC and right fusiform gyrus. TD individuals exhibited a significant decrease in connectivity with age, and ASD individuals showed increased connectivity with age. \n\n\n### Dorsal caudal and rostral putamen (dcP, drP) \n  \nThe dorsal putamen is involved in primary motor control including motor selection and execution. \n\n#### dcP \n  \nGroup differences: We found a main effect of diagnosis group in connectivity between the left dcP and the left superior medial gyrus, and between the right dcP and the left middle frontal gyrus. In both clusters, TD individuals exhibited increased connectivity relative to ASD. \n\n\n#### drP \n  \nGroup differences: With the left drP, the ASD group showed increased connectivity with the right superior and inferior parietal lobule, and decreased connectivity with the left superior medial, superior frontal, and inferior frontal gyri. With the right drP, the ASD group demonstrated decreased connectivity with the right parahippocampal gyrus, and increased connectivity with the superior occipital gyrus. \n\nWhole brain group \u00d7 age interaction: We found no whole brain age group by diagnosis interactions with either the dcP or the drP. \n\n\n\n### Ventral rostral putamen (vrP) \n  \nThe ventral rostral putamen is implicated in cognitive control and executive function, with connections to the anterior cingulate, and regions of the insula. \n\nGroup differences: Collapsed across age, the ASD group showed increased connectivity between the left vrP and right superior parietal lobule, and decreased connectivity between the right vrP and the right inferior frontal gyrus, relative to TD. \n\nWhole brain group \u00d7 age interaction: There were significant age by diagnosis interactions in connectivity between the left vrP and the left medial temporal pole, the right fusiform gyrus, and the right superior temporal gyrus. We also found an interaction between the right vrP and the right inferior temporal gyrus. The ASD group showed increased connectivity with age, and the TD group showed significant decreases with age in all clusters except the superior temporal gyrus, which showed no change over development in the ASD group and a significant decrease in connectivity in the TD group. \n\n\n### Inferior and superior ventral striatum (VSi and VSs) \n  \nThe ventral striatum, which has connections to medial aspects of the prefrontal cortex, and other areas of the limbic system, is strongly implicated in reward-related processing. \n\n#### VSi \n  \nGroup differences: We found a significant group difference between the Right VSi and the right anterior cingulate cortex. \n\nWhole brain group \u00d7 age interaction: Age by diagnosis group interactions were evident in connectivity from both VSi seeds to the bilateral cerebellum (Lobule VI and Lobule VIIa, Crus I). In addition, we found an interaction between the left VSi and the right amygdala and right fusiform gyrus, and between the right VSi and the left supplementary motor area. The ASD participants showed significant increases with age whereas TD showed decreases with age except with the right fusiform gyrus, where the ASD group showed no change with development. \n\n\n#### VSs \n  \nWhole brain group \u00d7 age interaction: There were significant age by diagnosis group interactions between both VSs seeds and the cerebellum (Lobules VI and VIIa, Crus I), precuneus, and right inferior temporal gyrus. The ASD group showed increased connectivity with age, whereas the TD group showed decreased connectivity with age. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe examined striatal resting state functional connectivity across the ages of 8\u201336 years in individuals diagnosed with ASD, relative to typically developing individuals. Using previously defined striatal seed ROIs (Di Martino et al.,  ), we identified connections associated with each seed, respectively, and examined changes in connectivity patterns across age and between diagnosis groups. To the best of our knowledge this study is the first to examine striatal functional connectivity in ASD across development, from late childhood to adulthood. Thus, our results provide a novel understanding of the development of functional connectivity with the striatum in ASD and identify connectivity patterns that parallel and deviate from typical development. \n\nPatterns of striatal functional connectivity in both individuals with ASD and TD individuals were consistent with previous studies utilizing the same seed regions in both child and adult populations separately (Di Martino et al.,  ,  ; Kelly et al.,  ; Furman et al.,  ). In general, we noted a dorsal to ventral and medial to lateral gradient, where more dorsal seeds in striatum were significantly connected to dorsal and lateral aspects of cortex, and ventral areas of striatum connected to more medial and ventral cortical regions. This is consistent with purported cognitive/affective divisions previously identified in cortico-striatal circuits using the same seed regions (Di Martino et al.,  ). Collapsed across diagnostic groups, we found decreases in connectivity between all striatal seeds and various cortical areas across age, consistent with studies of typical development, which may reflect necessary decreases in striatal influence over cortical function, supporting the emergence of long-range cortico-cortico connectivity in adulthood (Fair et al.,  ,  ; Kelly et al.,  ; Supekar et al.,  ; Dosenbach et al.,  ). As developmental changes that occur in typically developing individuals are often interpreted as necessary for maturation into adulthood, regions that show similar age-related change with TD suggest intact development in ASD. Thus, deviations from typical maturation may indicate development of compensatory connections or impairments that persist into adulthood. \n\nStable disorder effects (i.e., connections that are atypical in ASD independent of age) were noted with only the putamen and the inferior ventral striatum seeds, and suggest that posterior connections (superior and inferior parietal lobule) are increased, whereas anterior connections (anterior cingulate and superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri) are decreased in ASD. Previous resting state functional connectivity studies using the striatum did not find differences in the posterior parietal cortex, and differences with the prefrontal cortex have been in the opposite direction with ASD individuals (both children and adults) showing increased striatal-prefrontal connectivity relative to typicals (Turner et al.,  ; Di Martino et al.,  ; Delmonte et al.,  ) with some studies reporting no differences (Kennedy and Courchesne,  ; Tyszka et al.,  ). Discrepant findings previously might have been specific to the age groups tested, whereas the present study controlled for age-related changes when examining group differences. We suggest that there are differences in network connectivity in ASD that is characterized by both hypo- and hyper- connectivity in a region specific manner. Although the behavioral implications of these findings are unclear, these novel results highlight atypical connectivity patterns that are unchanged with development (see Figure  ). One caveat to the interpretation of these group level findings in relation to prior results must be highlighted. We did not include the average global time series as a nuisance regressor (GSR), as prior studies did due to our use of the PESTICA program to estimate and remove the effects of physiological noise, as well as the recent evidence in the literature regarding the potential spurious correlations that may arise when using GSR with seed based resting state analyses in both typical (Saad et al.,  ), and ASD samples (Gotts et al.,  ). A recent resting state study in children with ASD suggested that GSR does not significantly alter resting state results (Di Martino et al.,  ), although those findings were specific to a different measure of connectivity [network centrality\u2014which may be less affected by GSR (Yan et al.,  )] than the seed based correlations used in the current study. Although differences in preprocessing is a limitation in our ability to compare our results to previous findings, nonetheless, we estimated and removed physiological noise without the potential confounds of GSR. As it is vital that results be comparable in the literature, and future developmental work in ASD should consider both GSR and non-GSR approaches in analysis and interpretation. \n\nThe predominant goal of the current study was to identify regions that showed age-related differences from late childhood to adulthood in ASD relative to TD. Within the majority of clusters that showed age by diagnosis group interactions, the TD individuals showed significant developmental decreases, whereas the ASD group showed increases with age, suggesting deviating developmental trajectories into adulthood. Similar to the direction of results in the current study, prior research has suggested that maturation of white matter connectivity is aberrant in ASD relative to TD in a similar fashion in roughly the same age range (10\u201340), with ASD participants showing increased white matter integrity in subcortical to cortical projection tracts across age, whereas TD participants showed decreased white matter connectivity (Kleinhans et al.,  ). It is possible that age-related differences in structural connectivity in subcortical-cortical tracts underlie the functional differences noted in the present study. \n\nNotably, age by diagnosis interactions revealed that the connectivity between striatum and superior aspects of the cerebellum, specifically with regions VI and VIIa (including Crus I) were decreased in TD participants but increased in ASD. These differences in the development of cerebellar connectivity are not surprising given the convergence of evidence targeting the cerebellum as a locus of abnormality in ASD (Courchesne et al.,  ; Nowinski et al.,  ; for review see Fatemi et al.,  ). The cerebellum has extensive connections with cortical and subcortical brain regions, including bidirectional connections with striatum (Habas et al.,  ; Krienen and Buckner,  ; Strick et al.,  ; Bostan and Strick,  ). Studies have previously shown that individuals with lesions in cerebellar areas including lobules VI and VIIa demonstrate cognitive impairments such as motor control and planning, attention, sensory integration, language, and affective processes (Habas et al.,  ; Krienen and Buckner,  ; Stoodley et al.,  ), all of which are known to be affected in ASD. Furthermore, structural MRI research has found reduced overall cerebellar as well as reduced regional gray matter volume in children, adolescents and adults with ASD (Hashimoto et al.,  ; Bauman and Kemper,  ; Stanfield et al.,  ; Riva et al.,  ). Functional MRI research has demonstrated atypical cerebellar activation during motor control (Muller et al.,  ; Allen et al.,  ; Mostofsky et al.,  ), and attention (Allen and Courchesne,  ) in children, adolescent and adults with ASD separately. Finally, functional connectivity findings suggest reduced connectivity between cerebellum and motor execution areas (e.g., sensorimotor and supplementary motor cortices) in children with ASD (Mostofsky et al.,  ). These findings highlight a potential developmental deficit where initial hypoconnectivity relative to TD may be later compensated with relative hyperconnectivity in adulthood, specifically in more ventral aspects of striatum that are involved in reward processing (VSi and VSs). As we did not find any significant correlations with our cerebellar clusters and ADI scores, further work will have to explore the behavioral implications of the aberrant development of cerebellar connectivity in ASD. It is important to note one limitation with our cerebellar results; due to differences in head size between participants, we were unable to acquire complete coverage of cerebellum across all participants. Therefore, our results were limited to the anterior and superior portions of the cerebellum. It is possible that there are connectivity differences with inferior aspects of the cerebellum that we were unable to detect. \n\nThe inferior and superior temporal gyri (ITG and STG) and the fusiform gyrus (FG) also showed age by diagnosis group interactions, mainly demonstrating increased connectivity with age in ASD, and decreased in TD. Two clusters suggested developmental arrests or delays in ASD (showing no change with age), and significant decreases with TD; connectivity between the left vrP and the superior temporal gyrus, and the left VSi and the right fusiform gyrus. Structural abnormalities of the temporal gyri gray matter have also been reported in children, adolescents, and adults with ASD, which may contribute to differences in the development of connectivity with temporal regions (Jou et al.,  ; Toal et al.,  ). ITG and FG connectivity differences were found in connections with both dorsal and ventral aspects of the striatum. The ITG and FG, which are components of the ventral stream visual pathway with direct connections to occipital cortex, are largely implicated with face processing, face recognition, and in discrimination of facial expression, including affective interpretation, which may be affected in ASD (Sergent et al.,  ; Kanwisher et al.,  ; Apps et al.,  ; Prochnow et al.,  ). Exaggerated ITG activation and reduced FG activation during face perception in young adults with ASD has also previously been reported (Schultz et al.,  ; Coutanche et al.,  ). The STG has previously been implicated in social communication abnormalities in ASD (Frith,  ; Wang et al.,  ; Pelphrey et al.,  ; Hubbard et al.,  ). Therefore, abnormalities in striatal connectivity with the temporal cortex may underlie social and/or social reward deficits. \n\nWe also found a significant age by group interaction between the inferior ventral striatum and the amygdala. Several prior studies have reported altered activation in and reduced connectivity with the amygdala in association with social perception deficits in ASD (e.g., Kleinhans et al.,  ; Pelphrey and Carter,  ; Sato et al.,  ), although these findings were with the ITG and not striatum. Given the role of the ventral striatum in reward-related processing and its extensive connections to the amygdala, it is possible that aberrant functional connectivity between striatum and amygdala underlies deficits in social rewards in ASD, which may increase in a compensatory fashion over development (e.g., Delmonte et al.,  ; Sepeta et al.,  ). \n\nThis is the first study to examine age related change in functional connectivity with striatum in ASD compared to typical development. We identified a number of connections, with a range of brain regions, showing atypical development from late childhood to adulthood. Importantly, we found that social processing regions such as ITG, STG, and FG, and cerebellar regions implicated in cognitive and motor functions demonstrated a decrease in connectivity over development in TD, but an increase in ASD. As these are novel findings, replication will be necessary, especially given recent debates in the literature regarding methodological considerations related to head motion (e.g., Power et al.,  ; Satterthwaite et al.,  ; Yan et al.,  ), and the removal of nuisance variables such as physiological noise and/or the global signal e.g., when analyzing resting state data. In addition, it is likely that larger sample sizes, wider age ranges, and longitudinal data are needed to replicate these findings, and perhaps identify patterns that the current study may not have had the power to detect, including correlations with symptoms of ASD, identifying regions that show developmental delays, and non-linear trajectories. Despite these limitations, our findings were robust and highlight the important notion that examining the progression of ASD over development is crucial for identifying the neural bases of ASD and how they relate to behavioral impairments in the disorder. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tASD (n = 41)\tASD (n = 41).1\tASD (n = 41).2\tTD (n = 48)\tTD (n = 48).1\tTD (n = 48).2\tUnnamed: 7\nMales, n (%)\t35 (85)\t35 (85)\t35 (85)\t41 (85)\t41 (85)\t41 (85)\t\nRight handed, n (%)\t36 (88)\t36 (88)\t36 (88)\t46 (96)\t46 (96)\t46 (96)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tt-test\n\tMean (SD)\tMinimum\tMaximum\tMean (SD)\tMinimum\tMaximum\tp-value\nAge (years)\t17.28 (6.10)\t9.33\t33.90\t17.08 (6.41)\t8.39\t36.38\t0.88\nFull scale IQ\t111 (12)\t86\t131\t111 (10)\t86\t130\t0.81\nVerbal IQ\t108 (11)\t83\t132\t108 (11)\t88\t132\t0.91\nPerformance IQ\t112 (12)\t86\t128\t110 (10)\t86\t132\t0.65\nADOS\tADOS\tADOS\tADOS\tADOS\tADOS\tADOS\tADOS\nCommunication\t4 (1)\t2\t8\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\nSocial\t8 (2)\t5\t12\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\nTotal\t12 (3)\t7\t19\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\nADI\tADI\tADI\tADI\tADI\tADI\tADI\tADI\nSocial\t21 (5)\t8\t28\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\nCommunication\t16 (4)\t9\t25\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\nRRB\t6 (2)\t2\t12\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\nAbnormal\t3 (1)\t0\t5\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\u2013\t\n### Caption\nDemographic information.\n### Footer\nADOS, Autism Diagnosis Observation Schedule; ADI, Autism Diagnostic Interview; SD, Standard Deviation; ASD, Autism Spectrum Disorder; TD, Typical Development.

Although preclinical research indicates that OT modulates the functional output of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system that processes rewards, no clinical brain imaging study to date has examined the effects of OT on this system using a reward processing paradigm. To address this, we used an incentive delay task to examine the effects of a single dose of intranasal OT, versus placebo (PLC), on neural responses to social and nonsocial rewards in children with ASD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nIn this placebo-controlled double-blind study, 28 children and adolescents with ASD (age:   M  \u2009=\u200913.43\u00a0years, SD\u2009=\u20092.36) completed two fMRI scans, one after intranasal OT administration and one after PLC administration. During both scanning sessions, participants completed social and nonsocial incentive delay tasks. Task-based neural activation and connectivity were examined to assess the impact of OT relative to PLC on mesocorticolimbic brain responses to social and nonsocial reward anticipation and outcomes. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCentral analyses compared the OT and PLC conditions. During nonsocial reward anticipation, there was greater activation in the right nucleus accumbens (NAcc), left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), bilateral orbital frontal cortex (OFC), left superior frontal cortex, and right frontal pole (FP) during the OT condition relative to PLC. Alternatively, during social reward anticipation and outcomes, there were no significant increases in brain activation during the OT condition relative to PLC. A Treatment Group \u00d7 Reward Condition interaction revealed relatively greater activation in the right NAcc, right caudate nucleus, left ACC, and right OFC during nonsocial relative to social reward anticipation during the OT condition relative to PLC. Additionally, these analyses revealed greater activation during nonsocial reward outcomes during the OT condition relative to PLC in the right OFC and left FP. Finally, functional connectivity analyses generally revealed changes in frontostriatal connections during the OT condition relative to PLC in response to nonsocial, but not social, rewards. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe effects of intranasal OT administration on mesocorticolimbic brain systems that process rewards in ASD were observable primarily during the processing of nonsocial incentive salience stimuli. These findings have implications for understanding the effects of OT on neural systems that process rewards, as well as for experimental trials of novel ASD treatments developed to ameliorate social communication impairments in ASD. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s11689-018-9228-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors (APA [ ]). Although various pharmacological treatments are commonly prescribed to treat associated symptoms of ASD (e.g., irritability, inattention, and aggression), there are currently no pharmacological treatments approved to treat the core features of the disorder [ \u2013 ]. \n\nThe neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has been shown to increase pro-social behaviors in human studies and in preclinical model organisms. Studies in typically developing individuals have shown that intranasal OT administration increases in-group trust [ ] and interoceptive awareness [ ] while also reducing fear [ ]. Preclinical studies, on the other hand, have established the vital role of OT in sociality. For example, in mammalian nonhuman models, OT moderates or initiates paternal and reproductive behaviors, as well as other pro-social behaviors such as grooming and social recognition [ ,  ]. \n\nBecause of the need for effective treatments for core ASD symptoms, there has been increasing interest in the potential for OT to ameliorate social communication impairments in ASD. Some, but not all, studies of the effects of OT in ASD have reported benefits in social functioning, including enhanced emotion recognition [ ], increased eye gaze [ ], and enhanced feelings of trust in others [ ]. Other studies, however, have failed to find clinical benefits of OT on primary social outcome measures [ ,  ], and a recent trial found that the beneficial effects of OT on social functioning in ASD were moderated by pre-treatment endogenous OT levels, suggesting that OT may be beneficial for some, but not all, individuals with ASD [ ]. \n\nAlthough there is emerging evidence that OT may be clinically beneficial for at least a significant subset of individuals with ASD, the mechanisms of action of OT are not well understood. One potential mechanism of action may be the capacity of OT to modulate sensitivity to, and the perceived salience of, external rewards that influence behavior and facilitate reward-based learning. Preclinical studies implicate the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system as a mechanism by which OT exerts its pro-social effects [ ,  ]. This neural network is comprised of midbrain structures (the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra), the striatum, and cortical regions including the orbital frontal, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortices [ ]. OT and mesocorticolimbic dopamine interact in such a manner that the activation of OT-responsive neurons in the VTA increases dopaminergic activity in the broader mesocorticolimbic system [ \u2013 ]. Furthermore, when administered an OT receptor agonist, mice demonstrate a subsequent decrease in dopaminergic release within the nucleus accumbens, reflecting the influence of OT on mesocorticolimbic dopamine transmission [ ]. \n\nTo date, no functional neuroimaging study has examined the effects of OT on the mesocorticolimbic system in response to rewards in ASD. However, two functional neuroimaging studies indicate the relevance of mesocorticolimbic brain regions to the potential mechanisms of action of OT in ASD. Gordon et al. [ ] found increased activation in the ventral striatum, left posterior superior temporal sulcus, and left premotor cortex in ASD in response to acute intranasal OT administration during a socio-emotional recognition task and that these same brain regions showed decreased activation to nonsocial (i.e., object) judgements. Other research from this group found that intranasal OT administration increased functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in ASD in response to a biological motion task, underscoring the potential centrality of mesocorticolimbic brain regions to the mechanism of action of OT [ ]. \n\nAlthough both of these studies highlight the potential relevance of reward-responsive mesocorticolimbic brain regions to the mechanism of action of OT in ASD, neither used a reward task to directly test this hypothesis. Thus, the goal of the present study was to extend these findings by assessing the impact of acute intranasal OT administration on response to rewards in ASD using social and nonsocial incentive delay tasks. Social and nonsocial incentive delay tasks have been used in multiple studies to investigate reward processing in ASD (for a review see [ ]). These studies have consistently revealed reduced ventral striatal activation during social and nonsocial reward anticipation in ASD [ \u2013 ]. Although the pattern of mesocorticolimbic responses to rewards in ASD is complex (i.e., different studies with different sample characteristics have reported decreased ventral striatal responses to social, but not nonsocial, reward anticipation in ASD [ ,  ] whereas others have reported decreased ventral striatal responses to nonsocial, but not social, reward anticipation in ASD [ ]), it is clear that mesocorticolimbic responses to rewards in ASD are impaired and that incentive tasks are suitable to study the functional integrity of this system. \n\nParticipants in the current study completed functional neuroimaging scans after double-blind administration of OT or PLC, and responses to nonsocial and social rewards were examined. We hypothesized that intranasal OT administration, relative to PLC, would result in greater activation and connectivity within mesocorticolimbic brain regions (frontal lobes, amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NAcc), insula, thalamus, caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and putamen) that have previously been found to be functionally impaired during reward processing in ASD [ ]. We also hypothesized that the effects of OT would be more pronounced in the social, relative to nonsocial, reward context because of the putative pro-social effects of OT described earlier [ ,  ]. Finally, we explored relations between neural response to OT, symptom severity, and salivary OT concentrations. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University Medical Center, and informed consent was obtained from the parent or guardian of each participant before testing. Participants older than 11 also provided verbal and written assent. Participants were recruited through the Autism Research Registry maintained through the Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities. Exclusion criteria included a history of medical conditions associated with ASD, including Fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, neuro-fibromatosis, phenylketonuria, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury, full-scale intelligence <\u200970, and MRI contraindications. \n\nThe study enrolled 33 children and adolescents with ASD ages 10 to 17\u00a0years old. Diagnoses were based on a history of clinical diagnosis confirmed by proband assessment by a research reliable assessor via Module 3 or 4 of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2; [ ]) using standard clinical algorithm cutoffs. Of the 33 individuals enrolled, data from 28 were analyzable (see Table\u00a0 ): one participant elected to discontinue testing during the first visit, another was unable to complete the scan due to claustrophobia, and three participants were excluded due to excessive motion (see \u201c \u201d for details).   \nParticipant characteristics \n  \nADOS-2 calibrated severity scores were calculated for modules 3 and 4 using guidelines established by Gotham et al. [ ] and Hus and Lord [ ] \n\n ADOS-2   Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition \n  \n\nAfter providing informed consent, participants completed two fMRI sessions (one after OT administration and one after PLC administration, with the order of scans counter-balanced across participants). The two scan sessions were scheduled at least 72\u00a0h apart to minimize the possibility of carry-over effects of OT administration (mean time between scans\u00a0= 15\u00a0days; range =\u00a03\u201346\u00a0days). Participants were offered the opportunity to participate in an optional mock scan prior to the neuroimaging sessions. Families were compensated $50 for each visit attended. \n\n\n### Drug protocol \n  \nOxytocin (Syntocinon\u00ae, Novartis, Switzerland) and a matched solution containing no medication (PLC) were repackaged into identically appearing bottles. The administration sequence was counter-balanced by UNC Investigational Drug Service and Triangle Compounding Pharmacy, and OT and PLC were administered to participants by a blinded research assistant. A 24 international unit (IU)/mL dose of each solution was administered in alternating nostril insufflations (six total puffs) over the course of several minutes. This dose was the same as those used in multiple previous studies examining the effect of OT in adults, adolescents, and children with ASD [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Recent clinical and preclinical findings have demonstrated intranasal OT\u2019s ability to increase peripheral (i.e., cerebrospinal fluid, plasma) OT concentrations [ ], while preclinical research has reported augmented brain OT levels following intranasal OT administration [ \u2013 ]. \n\n\n### fMRI task \n  \nAs described in Richey et al., participants completed two versions of an incentive delay tasks [ ] such that nonsocial rewards (i.e.,\u00a0money) and social rewards (i.e.,\u00a0pictures of smiling faces) were presented as rewards on alternating runs. Participants were presented with two runs of the nonsocial reward condition and two runs of the social reward condition. On all runs, rewards could be won or not won (i.e., there was no \u201closs\u201d condition). Face stimuli were smiling images from the NimStim set of facial expressions [ ]. Each run began with a 10-s instructional screen indicating the forthcoming reward type (i.e., nonsocial or social), and the two task types were segregated by run to minimize the number of cues to be memorized. \n\nEach trial consisted of (1) a 2000-ms cue indicating whether adequately quick responses to the bull\u2019s-eye would result in a \u201cwin\u201d (a triangle) or not (a circle); (2) a 2000\u20132500-ms crosshair fixation; (3) a target bull\u2019s-eye presented for up to 500\u00a0ms that requires a speeded button press; (4) 3000\u00a0ms of feedback that indicated whether that trial was a \u201cwin\u201d or not, with wins accompanied by either an image of money or a face; and (5) a variable length ITI crosshair resulting in a total trial duration of 12\u00a0s. Potential win and non-win trials were aperiodic and pseudorandomly ordered. Each 8-min run contained 40 trails, half of which were potential win trials. The task was adaptive such that participants were successful on two thirds of trials, regardless of individual differences in RTs (confirmed via inspection of behavioral data collected during scanning). Mean reaction times were calculated during practice trials prior to the scan and then entered into the fMRI paradigm to ensure that participants succeeded on 66% of their responses as described in [ ]. \n\nDuring nonsocial runs, participants won $1 per trial if bull\u2019s-eye responses were adequately quick. During social runs, participants viewed a face image if bull\u2019s-eye responses were adequately quick. Coincident with feedback, cumulative win totals were presented. Participants were instructed to respond to all target bull\u2019s-eyes as quickly as possible to win on as many trials as possible and win or non-win outcomes were contingent on reaction times (RTs). Standard administration of incentive delay tasks involves showing participants\u2019 rewards that may be won prior to scanning [ ]. Consistent with this procedure, participants were shown the money they could win based on scanner task performance and were informed that they would receive the total amount of money won during the scan. Prior to scanning, participants rated face stimuli on the dimensions of valence and arousal. Stimuli were presented using E-Prime presentation software version 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA). \n\nPrior to and immediately following each scan, participants were asked to rate face stimuli on the dimensions of valence, arousal, and trust using Qualtrics software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) on a computer outside of the scanner (pre-scan ratings were completed prior to the nasal spray administration). \n\n\n### Imaging methods and preprocessing \n  \nFunctional imaging data were acquired at the Duke-UNC Brain Imaging and Analysis Center (BIAC) on a 3.0-T General Electric (Waukesha, WI, USA) MR750 scanner system equipped with 50\u00a0mT/m gradients and an eight-channel head coil. High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired with 256 axial slices using an FSPGR pulse sequence (TR\u2009=\u20098.16\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u20093.18\u00a0ms; flip angle\u2009=\u200912\u00b0; FOV\u2009=\u2009256; image matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u00a0mm ; voxel size\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00a0mm) for normalization and co-registration. Whole brain functional images were acquired with 64 axial slices oriented parallel to the AC-PC plane using a spiral-in SENSE sequence (TR\u2009=\u20091500\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u00a0ms; flip angle\u2009=\u200960\u00b0; FOV\u2009=\u2009240; image matrix\u2009=\u200964\u00a0mm ; voxel size\u2009=\u20093.75\u2009\u00d7\u20093.75\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u00a0mm). The first four volumes of each functional task were discarded to allow for steady state equilibrium. \n\nFunctional data were preprocessed using FSL version 5.0.1 (Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB), Oxford University, UK). Preprocessing was applied as follows: (1) brain extraction for non-brain removal [ ], (2) motion correction using MCFLIRT [ ], (3) spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 5\u00a0mm, (4) mean-based intensity normalization of all volumes by the same factor, and (5) high-pass filtering [ ]. Functional images were co-registered to structural images in native space, and structural images were normalized into a standard stereotaxic space (Montreal Neurological Institute). Registrations used an intermodal registration tool [ ,  ]. Voxel-wise temporal autocorrelation was estimated and corrected using FMRIB\u2019s Improved Linear Model [ ]. \n\n#### Motion correction \n  \nConsistent with motion thresholds used in Gordon et al. [ ], runs with maximum motion >\u20093\u00a0mm along any of six axes (i.e.,   x  ,   y  ,   z  , pitch, yaw, and roll) were excluded from analyses. Due to excessive motion (>\u20093\u00a0mm), some participants only had one social and/or nonsocial reward condition run per scan. Participants were only included in the final analyses if they had at least one nonsocial and one social run that met motion criteria for both their OT and PLC scans. Either due to motion or the participant\u2019s ability to stay in the scanner for the entire length of the scan, 17 of the 56 scans had less than four total runs. Sixty-six percent of runs included in analyses had <\u20091.0\u00a0mm of motion in any axis (pitch, roll, yaw,   x  ,   y  ,   z  ), 26% had 1.0\u20131.99\u00a0mm of motion, and 8% had motion between 2.0 and 2.9\u00a0mm. In addition to conducting motion correction using MCFLIRT [ ], time points with large motion, as defined by FSL, were entered into the general linear model (GLM) model as additional confound variables within first-level analyses using FSL\u2019s motion outlier detection program ( ). Following motion correction, paired   t   tests were used to compare differences in motion between OT and PLC groups: there was equivalent motion for mean and maximum values along all six axes (i.e.,   x  ,   y  ,   z  , pitch, yaw, and roll), all   p   values >\u2009.05. \n\n\n#### fMRI analysis \n  \nPlanned analyses included (1) treatment group (OT vs. PLC) differences in frontostriatal functional activation and connectivity in response to social reward anticipation and outcomes; (2) treatment group differences in frontostriatal functional activation and connectivity in response to nonsocial reward anticipation and outcomes; (3) treatment group differences in frontostriatal functional activation in response to nonsocial relative to social reward anticipation and outcomes, conducted also with a small volume correction for the striatum alone given the centrality of this region for reward processing; and (4) correlations between frontostriatal functional activation and connectivity with ASD symptoms and salivary OT analyses. \n\nSupplemental analyses included (1) main effects of OT and PLC separately on whole brain functional activation in response to nonsocial and social reward anticipation and outcomes, (2) treatment group (OT vs. PLC) differences in frontostriatal structural activation in response to social and nonsocial reward anticipation and outcomes, (3) correlations between structural activation with ASD symptoms, and (4) treatment group differences in frontostriatal functional connectivity of structurally defined clusters in response to social and nonsocial reward anticipation and outcomes. \n\n\n#### Small volume corrections \n  \nFor all analyses, anticipation and outcome phases were analyzed separately. Key anatomical regions within the reward system (superior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, orbitofrontal gyrus, paracingulate gyrus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NAcc), insula, thalamus, caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and putamen) were defined a priori for small volume correction. These regions were generated separately for the right and left hemispheres in FSL using the Harvard\u2013Oxford cortical and subcortical structural probabilistic atlases. Masks were thresholded at 25%, binarized, and then combined into a single mask using fslmaths. For planned main effect analyses (i.e., nonsocial and social reward conditions analyzed independently) and planned interaction analyses (i.e., nonsocial > social, social > nonsocial), voxels were considered significant if they passed a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 and were part of a 39-voxel cluster of contiguous significant voxels, resulting in a cluster-corrected   p  \u2009<\u2009.05. This cluster size was determined by performing 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using 3dClustSim [ ]. Interaction analyses (e.g., nonsocial > social) also included an analysis using a small volume correction that included only the striatum given our a priori interest in the striatum. Due to this small volume correction, interaction clusters within the striatum were considered significant if they passed a statistical threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.005 and were part of a 17-voxel cluster of contiguous significant voxels, resulting in a cluster-corrected threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 (again determined by performing 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using 3dClustSim [ ]). Localizations were based on Harvard\u2013Oxford cortical and subcortical structural probabilistic atlases as implemented in FSLView version 5.0.1, and all activations were visualized with MRIcron ( ). \n\n\n#### Activation analyses \n  \nWhole brain general linear model (GLM) activation analyses were conducted using the FSL expert analysis tool (FEAT). For ROI analyses, each participant\u2019s condition-specific mean percent signal change was calculated for both the social and nonsocial conditions. Within-participant activation differences were analyzed for treatment effects using paired   t   tests and using a 2 (Treatment Group: OT, PLC) \u00d7\u20092 (Reward Condition: nonsocial, social) ANOVA (see Additional file  : Supplementary Materials). Structural ROI activation results are also provided in Additional file  : Supplementary Materials. \n\n\n#### Connectivity analyses \n  \nTask-based functional connectivity was analyzed using a generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) approach due to its improved power, sensitivity, and specificity in detecting context-dependent functional connectivity [ ,  ]. Functional seeds were derived from activation clusters showing significant OT > PLC effects. These seeds were supplemented with structural left and right NAcc seeds because of the centrality of the NAcc to the mesocorticolimbic reward processing system [ ], once again defined using the Harvard\u2013Oxford subcortical structural probabilistic atlas. Voxel-wise models evaluated whole-brain connectivity with these seeds. For each participant, mean fMRI time courses (i.e., physiological regressors) were extracted from seed regions for each task run using   fslmeants   in FSL, then multiplied by each psychological regressor of interest (i.e., Trial Type: reward, non-reward) to form the PPI interaction terms. The gPPI model included physiological and psychological regressors, as well as their interaction terms to describe the unique effect of these interactions above and beyond the main effect of seed time courses and reward conditions. Our contrasts of interest evaluated the reward condition alone. No additional preprocessing procedures were completed beyond what has been described above. Supplemental analyses examined functional connectivity with anatomically defined right and left NAcc using the same procedures described for the functional connectivity analyses (see Additional file  : Supplementary Materials). \n\n\n#### Symptom analyses \n  \nSymptom analyses examined interactions between ASD symptom severity, measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) [ ], and functional activation and connectivity in the OT relative to PLC condition, conducted by including demeaned SRS values as a covariate within frontostriatal general linear models within the ASD group. Supplementary analyses examined interactions between ASD symptoms and structural activation, as well as functional activation of structurally defined clusters (see Additional file  : Supplementary Materials). \n\n\n\n### Salivary analyses \n  \nSaliva samples were collected using pediatric oral swabs (Salimetrics) prior to each nasal drug administration (i.e., OT and PLC) and immediately following the fMRI scan (time between samples in minutes   M  \u2009=\u200985; SD\u2009=\u20099). During each sample, participants were asked to place the swab under their tongue for approximately 1\u00a0min or until it was saturated with saliva. Samples were stored on ice for up to 2\u00a0h to liquid extraction and were permanently stored at \u2212\u200970\u00a0\u00b0C (see Additional file  : Supplementary Materials\u00a0for a more detailed description of the salivary analyses). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Face image ratings \n  \nParticipants rated the faces seen in the social reward condition on the dimensions of valence, arousal, and trust prior to and immediately following each scan. Results from a 2 (Treatment Group: OT, PLC) \u00d7 2 (Time point: pre- or post-scan) ANOVA revealed a main effect of time point for the dimension of trust, such that participants were more likely to rate the faces as more trustworthy at the post-scan rating (  M  \u2009=\u20095.07; SD\u2009=\u20091.59) compared to the pre-scan rating (  M  \u2009=\u20094.86; SD\u2009=\u20091.63), regardless of treatment condition,   F  (1,54)\u2009=\u20098.37,   p  \u2009=\u2009.006 (see Fig.\u00a0 ). Additionally, a main effect of time point for the dimension of arousal was observed, reflecting that participants perceived the faces at the post-scan rating (  M  \u2009=\u20095.04; SD\u2009=\u20091.75) to be more arousing than those at the pre-scan rating (  M  \u2009=\u20094.91; SD\u2009=\u20091.80) across treatment groups,   F  (1,54)\u2009=\u20094.42,   p  \u2009=\u2009.040. No other main effects or interactions between treatment group and time point for the perceived valence, arousal, or trust of the faces were significant, all   p   values >\u2009.05.   \nSubjective ratings of faces. Average ratings of valence, arousal, and trust of faces. Valence\u2009=\u20090 (extremely unpleasant) to 8 (extremely pleasant); arousal\u2009=\u20090 (not at all aroused) to 8 (extremely aroused); trust\u2009=\u20090 (not at all trustworthy) to 8 (extremely trustworthy). *  p  \u2009<\u2009.05 \n  \n\n\n### Task reaction times \n  \nReaction times (RTs) to task bull\u2019s-eyes are depicted in Fig.\u00a0  and were evaluated via a 2 (Treatment Group: OT, PLC) \u00d7 2 (Reward Condition: nonsocial, social)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (Trial Type: reward, non-reward) mixed ANOVA. There was a main effect for trial type,   F  (1,54)\u2009=\u200918.67,   p  \u2009<\u2009.0001, such that individuals responded more quickly to trials during which they could receive a reward (  M  \u2009=\u2009226.49; SD\u2009=\u200959.73) compared to trials in which they could not receive a reward (  M  \u2009=\u2009242.03; SD\u2009=\u200960.91). No other main effects or interactions between treatment group, reward condition, and trial type were significant, all   p   values >\u2009.05.   \nfMRI task reaction times. Mean reaction times of reward and non-reward trials during the social and nonsocial reward tasks. *  p  \u2009<\u2009.05 \n  \n\n\n### Functional activation analyses \n  \n#### Nonsocial reward \n  \nDuring nonsocial reward anticipation, there were no regions with relatively decreased activation in the OT relative to the PLC condition. However, there were several clusters with greater activation during nonsocial reward anticipation in the OT condition relative to PLC, including the right NAcc, right frontal pole (FP), left ACC, left superior frontal cortex, and bilateral orbital frontal cortex (OFC) (see Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ).  Significant increases in activation were observed during nonsocial reward outcomes after OT relative to PLC administration in the right OFC and left FP (see Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nDifferential functional activation after OT relative to PLC administration during nonsocial reward anticipation. Brain areas with greater activation during nonsocial reward anticipation after intranasal OT administration relative to PLC administration include the right nucleus accumbens (left), the right orbital frontal cortex (center), and the left anterior cingulate cortex (right) \n    \nEffects of oxytocin on functional activation \n  \n Hem   hemisphere,   k   cluster size in voxels,   BA   Brodmann area;   Z max   maximum   z  -value \n    \nDifferences in functional activation after OT relative to PLC administration during nonsocial reward outcomes. Brain areas with greater activation during nonsocial reward outcome after intranasal OT administration relative to PLC administration include the left frontal pole (left) and the right orbital frontal cortex (right) \n  \n\nSupplementary analyses for OT and PLC conditions separately are presented in Additional file  : Supplementary Materials and visualized within Additional file  : Figure S1 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a0 : Figure S2. These simple effects analyses revealed that both groups showed activation in mesocorticolimbic reward processing regions in response to the social and nonsocial incentive delay tasks. \n\n\n#### Social reward \n  \nDuring social reward outcomes, there was significantly decreased activation in the right frontal pole in the OT condition relative to the PLC condition. There were no other clusters with significant changes in activation during social anticipation or social outcomes in the OT condition relative to the PLC condition (see Additional file  : Supplementary Materials and Additional file  : Figure S3\u00a0for structural activation results for social and nonsocial reward anticipatory and outcomes). \n\n\n#### Treatment Group \u00d7 Reward Condition Interaction \n  \nWe next evaluated the impact of OT, relative to PLC, on nonsocial versus social reward processing by evaluating a Treatment Group \u00d7 Reward Condition interaction general linear model. OT increased activation in the right caudate nucleus, left ACC, bilateral FP, right insular cortex, and right OFC in response to nonsocial compared to social reward outcomes (see Table\u00a0 ). Planned analyses within the striatal small volume revealed greater activation during nonsocial relative to social reward anticipation after intranasal OT relative to PLC in the right NAcc. There were no regions with greater activation during social relative to nonsocial reward anticipation or outcomes after intranasal OT relative to PLC. \n\n\n#### Correlations between functional activation and ASD symptoms \n  \nIncreased ASD symptom severity, as measured by SRS total scores, was associated with greater activation in the right FP and the right ACC during nonsocial reward anticipation and greater activation in the right precentral gyrus and left caudate nucleus during nonsocial reward outcome following the administration of OT relative to PLC (see Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). This finding within the left caudate nucleus was corroborated by structural activation analyses (see Additional file  : Supplementary Materials). There were no relations between symptom severity and brain activation in the anticipation or outcome phases of the social reward condition.   \nCorrelations between SRS and differences in functional activation after OT vs. PLC during nonsocial reward anticipation.

Because there were no clusters that differentiated conditions in the social reward condition, functional connectivity results are only reported for connectivity in the nonsocial reward condition (functional connectivity of structurally defined clusters is presented in Additional file  : Supplementary Materials). \n\n#### Right nucleus accumbens seed \n  \nDuring nonsocial reward anticipation, OT relative to PLC administration resulted in increased functional connectivity between the right NAcc seed and the right frontal pole (see Fig.\u00a0 ), whereas OT-induced decreases in functional connectivity were observed between the right NAcc seed and the left precentral gyrus and the right superior frontal gyrus (see Table\u00a0 ). These findings were further corroborated by functional connectivity analyses of structurally defined clusters using a structural right NAcc seed (see Additional file  : Supplementary Materials and Additional file  : Figure S4). During nonsocial reward outcomes, increased functional connectivity was observed between the right NAcc and the right OFC and left FP in response to OT relative to PLC. Finally, decreased functional connectivity was exhibited between the right NAcc and right postcentral gyrus during nonsocial reward outcomes following OT administration relative to PLC.   \nFunctional connectivity during nonsocial reward anticipation with the functionally defined right nucleus accumbens seed.

Attenuated functional connectivity with the left ACC was also observed with bilateral postcentral gyrus, the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left precentral gyrus, and the left medial frontal gyrus during nonsocial reward outcomes following OT relative to PLC (Table  ). No increases in connectivity were exhibited with the left ACC for nonsocial reward anticipation or outcomes, all   p   values >\u2009.05.   \nFunctional connectivity with the left ACC seed \n  \n Hem   hemisphere,   k   cluster size in voxels,   BA   Brodmann area,   Z max   maximum   z  -value \n  \n\n\n#### Correlations between functional connectivity and ASD symptoms \n  \nFor the right NAcc and left ACC seeds, greater ASD symptom severity, measured by SRS total scores, was associated with increased connectivity with the right postcentral gyrus during nonsocial reward outcomes following OT relative to PLC (see Table\u00a0 ).

There were considerable individual differences in the magnitude of salivary OT change from baseline to post-scan following OT administration, and, thus, one outlier was removed from salivary analyses due to significantly elevated OT concentration levels (754.17\u00a0pg/ml) in the PLC condition. After the removal of this outlier, as expected, there was a significant increase in mean peripheral OT levels following OT administration relative to PLC,   t  \u2009=\u20093.57;   p  \u2009=\u20090.0016 (see Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nSalivary OT concentrations. Change in log-transformed salivary OT levels (pg/ml) for 24 participants (minutes between samples   M  \u2009=\u200985; SD\u2009=\u20099). Four participants were unable to provide adequate saliva samples and were not included in the salivary analyses.   a   Change in salivary OT following nasal OT administration.   b   Change in salivary OT following nasal-PLC administration. Because participant 10 was a significant outlier (change in OT concentration after PLC\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u2009723.59), their data are not included in the graph above.   c   *  p  \u2009<\u2009.05. Salivary samples collected after OT administration showed significantly greater OT concentrations compared to those following the PLC nasal spray,   t  \u2009=\u20093. 57;   p  \u2009=\u20090.0016 \n  \n\nBecause of the primary role of the NAcc in reward processing [ ], correlation analyses examined relations between changes in peripheral OT and neural activation within the right NAcc functional activation cluster identified in the nonsocial anticipation activation analysis. This revealed a significant positive correlation indicating that individuals with greater changes in peripheral OT concentrations following OT administration showed greater increased activation within the right NAcc functional activation cluster during nonsocial reward anticipation,   r  \u2009=\u20090.56;   p  \u2009=\u20090.005 (see Fig.\u00a0 ). However, when a significant outlier (2 SD\u2019s > the salivary group mean; 3 SD\u2019s > the activation group mean) was removed, the relation was no longer significant,   r  \u2009=\u20090.26;   p  \u2009=\u20090.23.   \nCorrelations between OT-related neural activation and OT salivary concentration changes following OT administration. Correlation between mean percent signal change in the right NAcc functional activation cluster during the anticipatory phase of the nonsocial reward condition and change in peripheral OT levels following OT administration \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of acute intranasal OT administration on functional activation and connectivity within mesocorticolimbic brain regions during the anticipation and receipt of social and nonsocial rewards in ASD. OT administration, relative to PLC administration, was associated with increased activity in the right NAcc, the right FP, the left ACC, the left superior frontal cortex, and bilateral OFC during anticipation of nonsocial rewards. These findings combined with prior ASD research demonstrating increased activation in the NAcc following OT administration during a social judgment task [ ] suggest that whether OT impacts social or nonsocial processing is contingent on task context. In addition, the correlation between salivary OT concentrations and changes in right NAcc activation indicates that this region may be particularly sensitive to the acute effects of OT (though this correlation was not significant following removal of an outlier). This is consistent with preclinical findings, which indicate that the NAcc is among several neural regions with the highest OT receptor density [ ]. \n\nAlthough we found increased left ACC activation after OT administration during nonsocial reward anticipation, Watanabe and colleagues [ ] reported increased ACC activation after OT administration during a social judgment task, reflecting the task-dependent nature of the effects of OT on neural responses to social or nonsocial processing. Our finding of increased activation of OFC, a region with an established role in reward processes documented in preclinical and clinical studies [ ,  ], during the anticipation and receipt of nonsocial rewards after OT administration is consistent with prior findings that ASD is characterized by attenuated OFC activation during nonsocial reward anticipation [ ] and suggests a remediation of this pattern in ASD after OT. \n\nIn contrast to previous studies examining the neural impact of OT in response to social stimuli in individuals with ASD [ ,  ], we did not find evidence of increased activity in mesocorticolimbic regions during social reward processing following OT administration. Further, interaction analyses showed increased activity in the right nucleus accumbens and right caudate nucleus during nonsocial reward anticipation relative to social reward anticipation. The lack of effects of OT in the social reward conditions are surprising and stand in contrast to preclinical findings that OT enhances neural responses to a range of social stimuli, including conditioned social preference [ \u2013 ] and reproductive behaviors [ ,  ] as well of the prosocial effects of OT in ASD [ ]. These unexpected findings highlight that OT may serve to increase neural activations in response to nonsocial rewards. These effects are consistent with preclinical findings that the impact of OT is apparent in the context of a certain nonsocial rewards, including food cues [ ,  ] and place preferences [ ,  ], and it may be the case that the clinical benefits of OT on social functioning in ASD (e.g., enhanced emotion recognition and increased eye gaze) reflect the influence of OT on mesocorticolimbic reward processing systems that mediate nonsocial incentive salience processing, reward valuation, and reward-based learning [ ] rather than responses specifically to social rewards. Alternatively, it may be the case that the static social rewards used in this study impeded our capacity to detect OT-related neural changes given that dynamic stimuli have been shown to be more potent elicitors of social impairments in ASD than static stimuli [ ]. Future studies that evaluate the impact of OT on neural responses to dynamic social rewards will be needed to evaluate this possibility. \n\nWe observed significant correlations between ASD symptom severity and increased activity within the right frontal pole and the left ACC during nonsocial reward anticipation in response to OT relative to PLC. Additionally, during nonsocial reward outcomes, increases in the left caudate nucleus and right precentral gyrus activity after OT relative to PLC were significantly correlated with symptom severity. The postcentral gyrus also showed greater connectivity with both the right NAcc and left ACC functional seeds as ASD symptom severity increased. These regions may be most responsive to neural effects of OT administration in individuals with more severe ASD presentations. Alternatively, these associations suggest that the impact of OT on responses to nonsocial rewards may be conditional on ASD symptom severity. These associations may also reflect mechanisms described by Parker and colleagues [ ] which revealed that individuals with ASD with lower endogenous levels of OT benefited the most from OT. Thus, it may be the case that individuals with greater ASD symptoms demonstrated greater regional activation changes during reward anticipation in response to OT. It is noteworthy that symptom correlations with neural responses to nonsocial reward anticipation were apparent in brain regions (FP and ACC) implicated in higher-order executive processing [ ] and known to show functional impairments in ASD in the context of cognitive control tasks [ ,  ]. Conversely, regions showing symptom correlations with neural responses to social reward anticipation involved regions implicated in other functioning, including imitation (precentral gyrus [ ]) and learning (the caudate nucleus [ ]), though the replicability of these patterns is not yet known. \n\nOT administration was associated broadly with decreased connectivity with functional seeds. Decreased connectivity was observed between the right NAcc and the left precentral gyrus and the right superior frontal gyrus during the anticipation of nonsocial rewards as well as with the postcentral gyrus during nonsocial reward outcomes following OT administration relative to PLC. Further, OT-induced attenuation in functional connectivity was observed between the left ACC functional seed and the left precentral gyrus, the right frontal pole, and the right superior frontal gyrus during nonsocial reward anticipation. During nonsocial reward outcomes, decreased functional connectivity was observed between the left ACC and bilateral postcentral gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and left medial frontal gyrus following OT relative to PLC. Resting state functional connectivity findings suggest that ASD is largely characterized by increased frontostriatal connectivity relative to typically developing controls [ \u2013 ], and the results of the present study suggest that OT may normalize these increased frontostriatal functional connections. \n\nThere were additional findings of increased functional connectivity after OT administration, including increased connectivity between the right NAcc and the right FP during nonsocial reward anticipation. OT-induced increased connectivity between the right NAcc and right FP was also reported by Gordon et al. [ ] using a biological motion task. This finding across two different task contexts highlights a neural pathway by which OT may exert a therapeutic effect by potentiating neural connectivity. The FP plays a critical role in the cognitive processing of future events [ ], a process that may be particularly relevant to reward contexts. Additionally, the right NAcc demonstrated relatively greater connectivity with the right FP and right OFC during nonsocial reward outcomes following OT administration relative to PLC, though the directionality of this effect was unexpected given that increased functional connectivity between the striatum and the OFC has been reported in ASD during resting-state functional connectivity [ ]. It is also noteworthy that the effects of OT on the NAcc and ACC exhibited right-lateralized effects given evidence of right lateralization of functional neural responses to social and nonsocial stimuli in ASD [ ,  ], though it should be noted that incentive delay tasks do not reliably evoke greater activation in one hemisphere or the other but rather tend to evoke bilateral reward-related frontostriatal activations [ ]. \n\nRatings of faces in the social task revealed a significant increase in ratings of trustworthiness and arousal for faces following the scan. These main effects were not moderated by treatment group (i.e., OT, PLC), indicating that individuals rated faces they had seen previously as more trustworthy across both treatment groups. Previous studies have reported that individuals with ASD reliably understand the concept of trustworthiness and distinguish trustworthy versus non-trustworthy faces [ ,  ]. Our results suggest that familiarity with faces may increase ratings of trustworthiness and arousal for individuals with ASD. No effects were observed for ratings of valence. \n\nTask reaction times showed increased speed of responses to reward relative to non-reward trials, with no significant interactions of treatment group (OT, PLC) or Reward Type (nonsocial, social). These findings are consistent with reports of decreased reaction times for reward compared to non-reward trial in ASD [ ]. Delmonte and colleagues [ ] reported no relation between reward condition (e.g., nonsocial vs. social) and reaction times. However, this stands in contrast with other ASD reward studies that have reported faster reaction times in response to nonsocial rewards compared to social rewards [ ,  ]. This discrepancy may reflect different ages of participants across studies: the current study and others showing no differences in reaction times based on reward condition were conducted in child and adolescent populations, whereas those showing faster responses for nonsocial versus social rewards were completed using adult participants. This may suggest that during development, nonsocial rewards may begin to have increased salience relative to social rewards in individuals with ASD. This might be related to increased awareness of the relationship between money and acquiring objects of interest and/or to increased demands in financial responsibility for adults living independently. This developmental interaction should be noted in future studies examining differential responses to nonsocial versus social rewards in ASD. It may also be useful to explore the salience of other nonsocial rewards in ASD. \n\nIn addition to the substantive findings reported here, these results have implications for future experimental therapeutic trials that seek to evaluate novel ASD therapeutics. The National Institute of Health has emphasized the use of translational research to speed the discovery of treatments through pipelines that evaluate the potential for novel compounds to engage brain targets relevant to disease etiology [ ]. In addition to providing substantive results about the neural impact of acute intranasal OT administration on reward processing brain systems, the present study also suggests that optimal approaches to evaluate novel ASD treatments with putative effects on brain systems that support social reward processing may not be constrained to evaluating responses to only social stimuli. Rather, novel pro-social ASD therapeutics may exert their influence on relevant brain targets in a range of social and/or nonsocial contexts. In this regard, these results provide preliminary data to guide the development of optimal targets for use in future experimental therapeutics trials that evaluate novel ASD social communication treatments. \n\nThe present study had some limitations. Developmental stage plays a particularly important moderating role in the strength of functional connectivity patterns in individuals with ASD, with younger individuals showing increased connectivity compared to adolescents and adults with ASD [ ]. Future studies with large sample sizes will be needed to examine the moderating effect of developmental stage on the effects of OT on brain activation and connectivity in ASD. Additionally, the effects of prolonged OT administration are likely to be distinct from the effects of a single dose, and future research should examine the effect of chronic OT administration on neural functioning in ASD. Additionally, the order of social and nonsocial runs was not randomized across participants in this study. Because the current study found no behavioral changes due to a single OT administration, interpretations regarding associations between behavioral and neural effects of OT must be cautious. Finally, because all participants in the present study met a minimum IQ cutoff of 70, findings from this study may be restricted to individuals with ASD with higher cognitive ability. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nDespite these limitations, these findings indicate a mechanistic role for the mesocorticolimbic system in the potentially therapeutic effect of oxytocin in individuals with ASD. These findings align with prior studies that highlight the important role of enhanced functioning of striatal regions as a potential mechanism of action of OT [ ,  ] and extend this area of research into the domain of striatal functioning in response to reward-based tasks. When the present findings are considered along with these prior fMRI studies, it appears that the role of the mesocorticolimbic system in the effects of OT on neural functioning is not confined to social rewards but may extend to nonsocial responses more broadly, depending on task contexts. \n\n\n## Additional files \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nCharacteristic\tMean\tStandard deviation\tRange\nAge\t13.43\t2.36\t10\u201317\nFull-scale IQ\t103.55\t15.19\t75\u2013128\nADOS-2 calibrated severity score\t8.46\t1.29\t7\u201310\nSRS total T score\t76.19\t10.66\t49\u201390\nSex\t26 males, 2 females\t26 males, 2 females\t26 males, 2 females\n### Caption\nParticipant characteristics\n### Footer\nADOS-2 calibrated severity scores were calculated for modules 3 and 4 using guidelines established by Gotham et al.

Within a 1.5\u202fT MRI operating room immediately prior to neurosurgery, a passive finger flexion sensorimotor paradigm was performed on each hand with the patients awake, and then immediately after the induction and maintenance of combined sevoflurane and propofol general anaesthesia. The depth of surgical anaesthesia was measured and confirmed with an EEG-derived technique, the Bispectral Index (BIS). The magnitude of the task-related BOLD response and BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia were determined. The fMRI data were assessed by three fMRI expert observers who rated each activation map for somatotopy and usefulness for radiological neurosurgical guidance. \n\nThe mean magnitudes of the task-related BOLD response under a BIS measured depth of surgical general anaesthesia were 25% (tumour affected hemisphere) and 22% (tumour free hemisphere) of the respective awake values. BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia ranged from 7% to 83% compared to the awake state. Despite these reductions, somatotopic BOLD activation was observed in the sensorimotor cortex in all ten data acquisitions surpassing statistical thresholds of at least   p  \u202f<\u202f0.001 . All ten fMRI activation datasets were scored to be useful for radiological neurosurgical guidance. \n\nPassive task-related sensorimotor fMRI acquired in neurosurgical patients under multi-pharmacological general anaesthesia is reproducible and yields clinically useful activation maps. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the technique and its potential value if applied intra-operatively. Additionally these methods may enable fMRI investigations in patients unable to perform or lie still for awake paradigms, such as young children, claustrophobic patients and those with movement disorders. \n   Highlights  \n  \nTask-related BOLD activation can be acquired under surgical general anaesthesia. \n  \nThis can be achieved using a passive finger flexion sensorimotor paradigm. \n  \nGeneral anaesthesia results in a reduced BOLD response and BOLD sensitivity. \n  \nThe technique results in reproducible and radiologically useful fMRI activation data. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nImage guidance using awake, pre-operatively acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is in many neurosurgical units an essential tool when resecting brain tumours. It enables accurate planning and intra-operative guidance, especially in the initial phase of the procedure. As surgery progresses however, cerebral structures on average shift by up to 9\u202fmm ( ;  ), thereby compromising the spatial correspondence of pre-operatively acquired images. This \u2018brain shift\u2019 phenomenon, if unaccounted for, can therefore lead to inadvertent damage to critical brain areas. \n\nOne way of addressing this problem is through the acquisition of intra-operative task-related fMRI ( ). Acquiring intra-operative task-related fMRI is more challenging than intra-operative structural MRI because fMRI relies on (i) the detection of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activation ( ) which is known to be affected by anaesthesia ( ;  ;  ); and (ii) activation paradigms that are applicable for unconscious patients. To establish the feasibility of intra-operative task-related fMRI, it is important to establish whether task-related BOLD activation can be detected in patients anaesthetised to the depth required for neurosurgery. Recent studies have shown that BOLD activation in the resting state can be detected in neurosurgical patients ( ;  ;  ) and prior to these there have been several studies that have shown task-related BOLD activation can be detected in anaesthetised patients ( ,  ,  ,  ). In all of these studies however only a single anaesthetic technique, either intravenous (propofol with or without an opioid) or inhalational (sevoflurane), was used but not propofol and sevoflurane together. Furthermore in none of these studies was there a measure to quantify the depth of the subjects' anaesthesia at the time of fMRI. In standard clinical practice for tumour surgery, general anaesthesia is usually achieved with multiple pharmacological agents (which may include intravenous and inhalational anaesthesia) acting on the central nervous system to suppress consciousness and pain detection ( ;  ). \n\nEstablishing the feasibility of detecting task-related BOLD activation in conventionally anaesthetised patients is a pre-requisite prior to the introduction of intra-operative fMRI and its acquisition under general anaesthesia following a craniotomy and exposure of the brain. The aims of our study were firstly to evaluate whether sensorimotor BOLD fMRI activation could be obtained under general anaesthesia at a depth permitting neurosurgery, using a simple, readily implemented passive finger flexion sensorimotor paradigm. We also aimed to determine the relative magnitude of the task-related BOLD response before and after general anaesthesia and the change in BOLD sensitivity, and finally to assess the accuracy of sensorimotor cortex localisation in the context of radiological neurosurgical guidance. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Patients \n  \nThis prospective study received institutional review board approval and all patients gave written informed consent prior to participation. Five patients with intrinsic tumours within the right cerebral hemisphere (two male, three female, mean patient age 33.7\u202fyears, SD\u202f=\u202f8.9\u202fyears) were prospectively recruited following referral for neurosurgical management. None of the patients had undergone previous treatment of their tumours. The inclusion criteria for the study were: a) supratentorial glioma b) undergoing intra-operative MRI-guided resection and c) no significant cardiovascular co-morbidity to preclude prolonged imaging under general anaesthesia. Images of each patient's tumour are shown in  . Patient A's tumour was a World Health Organization (WHO) grade II oligoastrocytoma measuring 13.0 cm  and was centred on the right anterior cingulate gyrus. Patient B's tumour was a grade III anaplastic oligodendroglioma measuring 36.5 cm  centred on the right superior and middle frontal gyri. The posterior margin of the tumour was 1.8\u202fcm from the hand motor region of the right pre-central gyrus and did not result in any distortion of the sensorimotor cortex. Patient C's tumour was a grade II oligoastrocytoma measuring 60.2 cm  and was centred on the right posterior temporal lobe involving the middle and inferior temporal gyri. Patient D's tumour was a grade II oligoastrocytoma measuring 38.2 cm  involving the right cingulate and superior frontal gyri. The posterior margin of the tumour was 2\u202fcm from the hand motor region of the right pre-central gyrus with no distortion of the sensorimotor cortex. Patient E's tumour was a grade II oligodendroglioma measuring 0.5\u202fcm  centred on the right supramarginal gyrus.   \nThe figure shows selected T1-weighted images of the patients A to E oriented in radiological convention showing the location of the tumour within the right cerebral hemisphere and fMRI activation clusters (image on far right). The clusters of voxels are colour coded to indicate the activation across the awake and anaesthetised states. Yellow voxels\u202f=\u202factivation seen only in the awake state. Blue voxels\u202f=\u202factivation seen only in the anaesthetised state. White voxels\u202f=\u202factivated in both states. In all patients the tumour was in the right cerebral hemisphere and so movement of the fingers of the left hand resulted in activation in the sensorimotor cortex of the right hemisphere. z\u202f=\u202fMNI co-ordinate for the slice. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n### Clinical management \n  \nThe study was performed within an intra-operative MRI (iMRI) operating room at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, a UK national neurosurgical referral centre. The iMRI operating room consists of a 1.5\u202fT MRI system within the operating theatre ( ). The pharmacological agents used at induction of anaesthesia are listed in  . These were the intravenous anaesthetic agent propofol, the opioid analgesic fentanyl and the neuromuscular blocking agent atracurium. General anaesthesia was then maintained using the inhalational anaesthetic agent sevoflurane. All patients, except patient D, also received an infusion of a second opioid analgesic remifentanil. The anaesthetic regimen and the dosages of the drugs administered by the neuroanaesthetists were not modified because of study participation. Systemic blood pressure, carbon dioxide concentration and oxygen saturations under anaesthesia were recorded ( ). Carbon dioxide concentrations were maintained within the normal physiological levels of between 4 to 5.7 kilopascals (kPa), with a respiratory rate of 10 to 15 breaths per minute (normoventilation) and blood oxygen saturations were maintained >98% with the use of increased inspired oxygen concentration as is standard clinical practice.   \nThe table lists the demographical, clinical and anaesthesia details of the five patients (A to E) participating in the study. Gender F\u202f=\u202ffemale M\u202f=\u202fmale, Age\u202f=\u202fage in years at time of study entry. All patients had tumours in the right cerebral hemisphere and tumour location refers to the lobe containing the tumour (F\u202f=\u202ffrontal, T\u202f=\u202ftemporal, P\u202f=\u202fparietal). Tumour volume is in cm \u00a0and was measured following manual segmentation using ITK-SNAP 3.6.0 ( ). Tumour type refers to the histological diagnosis of the tumour (OA\u202f=\u202foligoastrocytoma, AO\u202f=\u202fanaplastic oligodendroglioma, OD\u202f=\u202foligodendroglioma, 2\u202f=\u202fWHO grade II, 3\u202f=\u202fWHO grade III). Anaesthesia refers to the drugs and dosages (mg\u202f=\u202fmilligram, mcg\u202f=\u202fmicrogram, %) administered to the patients at induction of general anaesthesia (induction) and at the time of fMRI acquisition (during fMRI). For patient D, remifentanil was not administered (n/a\u202f=\u202fnot applicable). BIS refers to the Bispectral index measurement of the depth of anaesthesia at the time when the fMRI was acquired, with a level of <\u202f60 considered surgical anaesthesia. The BIS value is the average of the two measurements performed before and after fMRI. Three main physiological variables measured under anaesthesia are listed, these are (a) blood pressure measured in\u202fmm of mercury (mmHg) (b) end tidal carbon dioxide levels measured in kilopascal (kPa) and (c) oxygen saturation measured as a percentage (%). For sevoflurane and the physiological variables, the values during the left and right hand fMRI acquisitions are listed. \n  Table 1   \n\nTo quantify the depth of anaesthesia, measurement was performed with the Bispectral Index (BIS) Brain Monitoring System (Covidien, MN, USA). This system records a processed electroencephalography (EEG) measurement with scalp electrodes, resulting in a dimensionless number ranging from 100 (fully awake) to 0 (an isoelectric EEG), this value being the weighted sum of three descriptors which correlate with the depth of the hypnotic state. BIS is used in everyday clinical neurosurgical practice to measure the depth of anaesthesia and can minimise the risk of unintended awareness or excessively deep anaesthesia ( ). A BIS value of between 40 to 60 is considered appropriate for surgical anaesthesia ( ). The BIS measurement was performed twice, immediately before and after the fMRI was completed. \n\n\n### Functional imaging task \n  \nThe sensorimotor paradigm involved passive flexion of the patient's digits II to V at the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints at a frequency of 1\u202fHz ( ). The paradigm was performed by the same trained clinician (A.K.Y.) who performed the task on each of the five patients to limit any potential variability between patients. A single scanning run consisted of 10 blocks of finger flexion alternating with 10 blocks of rest. Both the task and rest blocks were 16\u202fs each in duration. The total imaging time was 5\u202fmin 32\u202fs. Right and left hand data were acquired in two different scanning runs, first on the right hand and then repeated for the left hand, eliciting activation in the cerebral hemispheres without and with the tumour. \n\nTo ensure correct timing for the task, a monitor was displayed within the iMRI operating room which showed the second by second countdown for the periods of task and rest. The paradigm was performed firstly with the patients awake and repeated immediately after anaesthesia, before the craniotomy. When awake, patients were instructed to relax and not to contribute to the movement. The paradigm was selected for its ease of use, applicability to anaesthetised patients and its inter-subject consistency in eliciting activation in the pre-central and post-central gyri (primary motor and sensory cortices). \n\n\n### MRI parameters \n  \nData were acquired on a 1.5\u202fT intra-operative MAGNETOM Espree Tim system whole-body MRI (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a 12-channel head coil. Functional acquisitions consisted of gradient-echo echo-planar images (EPI) with voxel size 3\u00d73\u00d73\u202fmm , repetition time TR/echo time TE/flip angle\u202f=\u202f3100\u202fms/40\u202fms/90\u00b0, field of view (FOV)\u202f=\u202f192\u202f\u00d7\u202f192\u202fmm , matrix size\u202f=\u202f64\u202f\u00d7\u202f64, and 42 slice whole brain coverage. A static magnetic field (B0) map using a double gradient-echo sequence was acquired for correction of susceptibility-induced geometric distortion of the EPI images with the following parameters: TR/TE1/TE2/flip angle\u202f=\u202f630\u202fms/4.92\u202fms/9.68\u202fms/60\u00b0, FOV\u202f=\u202f192\u202f\u00d7\u202f192\u202fmm , matrix size\u202f=\u202f64\u202f\u00d7\u202f64, 42 slices. High resolution T1-weighted images were acquired using a sagittally-acquired three-dimensional magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with voxel size 1.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.2\u202fmm , TR/TE/TI/flip angle\u202f=\u202f2250\u202fms/3.7\u202fms/1100\u202fms/15\u00b0, FOV\u202f=\u202f220\u00d7220\u202fmm , matrix size\u202f=\u202f192\u00d7192, 192 slices. \n\n\n### fMRI data processing and analysis \n  \nPreprocessing and statistical analysis of the fMRI data were performed in SPM12 (Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, London, UK), running in MATLAB 2012a (Mathworks, MA, USA). Spatial distortions in the functional data, resulting from non-linearities in the MRI gradient system, were corrected by use of an in-house developed software (NoGradWarp, SPM Toolbox) and applied to the EPI volumes and the voxel displacement map (VDM). Functional images were then unwarped to correct for susceptibility related distortion based on the VDM, spatially realigned to the first EPI volume, co-registered to the anatomical T1-weighted image, spatially normalised to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template and spatially smoothed with a 6\u202fmm full-width-half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel to permit application of Gaussian random-field theory ( ). Subject-specific fixed effect analyses compared functional volumes for task and rest, for each hand separately. Activation was assessed in the pre- and post-central gyri (sensorimotor cortex), which was defined anatomically using the Automated Anatomical Labelling (AAL) atlas ( ). The statistical threshold was corrected for multiple comparisons within these anatomical regions and across the whole brain (  p  \u202f<\u202f\u202f0.05). Results were also reported at an uncorrected threshold of   p  \u202f<\u202f\u202f0.001 (  p  \u202f<\u202f\u202f0.001 ) to replicate the clinical neuroradiological application of fMRI to neurosurgical planning, where too stringent a statistical threshold can lead to false negative areas of activation and inadvertent damage to functionally important areas. \n\n\n### Evaluation of the effect of anaesthesia on a) the magnitude of the task-related BOLD response and b) BOLD sensitivity \n  \nThe magnitude of the task-related BOLD response compared to rest was firstly measured using a region of interest (ROI) defined by the largest cluster of activation during the awake state within the MarsBaR toolbox in SPM ( ), scaling the parameter estimates for each voxel to the mean value across the entire ROI and expressed as a percentage (%). This was performed for each patient on each of their data sets relating to right and left hand activation when awake and under anaesthesia. The ROI was defined from the activation in the awake state because it was likely to provide a better indicator of anaesthesia's effect on the task-related BOLD response across a larger region of the sensorimotor cortex. It also ensured that the measurement was not biased to the anaesthetised state. \n\nTo assess how the task-related BOLD response was affected by anaesthesia and the presence of the tumour, we performed a repeated measures ANOVA with factor 1, state (awake versus anaesthesia) and factor 2, hemisphere (ROI in tumour affected versus tumour free hemisphere). This was conducted in SPSS (IBM SPSS 22, NY, USA) with a statistical threshold of   p  \u202f<\u202f0.05. \n\nAnaesthesia's effect on BOLD sensitivity was assessed by the use of t-score histograms ( ) which represented the number of activated voxels within each patient's ROI. Histograms were calculated for the tumour affected hemisphere when the patients were awake and under anaesthesia (t-score threshold of 3.1) with BOLD sensitivity defined as the ratio of activated  /  \u00d7 100%. The order of fMRI data acquisition, with the patients awake then anaesthetised, and selection of the region of interest for data extraction (voxels activated during the awake state) were both expected to bias sensitivity towards the awake state. Our approach therefore ensured that sensitivity in the anaesthetised state was not over-estimated. \n\nTo assess for any association between anaesthesia (sevoflurane concentration and the BIS measurements) and any observed changes in the task-related BOLD response, the data were firstly visually assessed with scatter plots of the independent variables plotted against the ratio of:  / . Data were formally assessed for association using the Spearman's correlation coefficient (r ), with a one-tailed significance level of p\u202f<\u202f0.05. BOLD response values are reported to 1 decimal place (DP) with correlation analyses performed on the raw data BOLD values to 4 DP. \n\n\n### Assessment of the clinical utility of anaesthesia fMRI data \n  \nThree expert observers in fMRI (T.A.Y., consultant neuroradiologist with 21\u202fyears experience, L.M., senior clinical scientist with 14\u202fyears experience and A.K.Y, neuroradiological fellow with 5\u202fyears experience) reviewed each data set at a statistical threshold of   p  \u202f<\u202f0.001  to determine if the activation was in the expected region of the pre- and post-central gyrus based upon localisation of the primary motor cortex using anatomical landmarks ( ). The data were determined to be either a) useful or b) suboptimal, based upon somatotopy, as to whether they could be used for clinically informing the neurosurgeon as to the location of sensorimotor fMRI activation. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### fMRI performed awake, prior to anaesthesia \n  \nTask-related BOLD activation in the pre-central and post-central gyri was observed in all patients ( ,  ).   shows the magnitude of the task-related BOLD response for each patient which ranged from 0.7% to 1.4%. The group mean magnitude of the task-related BOLD response was 1.2% (standard deviation (SD)\u202f=\u202f0.3) in the tumour affected hemisphere (left hand activation) and 0.9% (SD\u202f=\u202f0.2) in the tumour free hemisphere (right hand activation).   \nThe table lists the fMRI statistical results. These are shown for each of the patients A to E for the task in each sensorimotor cortex when awake and anaesthetised. Hand L\u202f=\u202fleft R\u202f=\u202fright hand movement. All patients had tumours in the right cerebral hemisphere and so left hand movement resulted in activation in the right sensorimotor cortex (tumour affected hemisphere). Movement of the right hand resulted in activation in the left sensorimotor cortex (tumour free hemisphere). k =\u202fnumber of voxels in the largest cluster, the height threshold was set at\u00a0  t  \u202f=\u202f4.97 (awake) and\u00a0  t  \u202f=\u202f3.1 (anaesthesia). x y z\u202f=\u202fMNI co-ordinates for the peak voxel activation in the cluster. The t-score is listed for the peak voxel of activation and the\u00a0  p  \u00a0values are given at three thresholds: uncorrected (P ), correction for multiple comparisons within the sensorimotor cortex ROI (P ) and across the whole brain (P ). \n  Table 2     \nThe magnitude of the task-related BOLD response are shown for the individual patients and the group. The upper table lists the magnitude of the BOLD response (%) for the left hand and right hand activation in patients A to E (to 1 DP). All patients had tumours in the right cerebral hemisphere and so left hand movement resulted in activation in the right sensorimotor cortex (tumour affected hemisphere). Movement of the right hand resulted in activation in the left sensorimotor cortex (tumour free hemisphere). The lower table lists the group results for the five patients. \n  Table 3   \n\n\n### fMRI performed under general anaesthesia \n  \nAt the time of fMRI acquisition in the anaesthetised state, BIS measurements ranging from 29 to 56 ( ) confirmed the surgically-appropriate depth of general anaesthesia in all five patients. Under general anaesthesia, activation was observed in both the tumour affected and tumour free sensorimotor cortex in all patients ( ,  ). The clusters were mostly reduced in extent under anaesthesia, the exceptions were right hand activation (in the tumour free hemisphere) for patient D and left hand activation (in the tumour affected hemisphere) for patient E. The peak voxel activation in every acquisition surpassed a statistical threshold of   p   \u202f<\u202f\u202f0.001  and were also mostly significant (  p  \u202f<\u202f0.05) after correcting for multiple comparisons across the entire brain. \n\nThe magnitude of the task-related BOLD response under general anaesthesia ranged from 0.1% to 0.5%, the group mean magnitude of the task-related BOLD response was 0.3% (SD\u202f=\u202f0.2) in the tumour affected hemisphere and 0.2% (SD\u202f=\u202f0.1) in the tumour free hemisphere ( ). \n\n\n### Reduction in the task-related BOLD response under anaesthesia \n  \nIn all patients, the magnitude of the task-related BOLD response ( ) was less in the anaesthesia condition. Compared to awake values, these were 25% in the tumour-affected right hemisphere ((0.3 under anaesthesia/1.2 awake)\u202f\u00d7\u202f100%) and 22% in the tumour free left hemisphere ((0.2 under anaesthesia/0.9 awake)\u202f\u00d7\u202f100%). This resulted in a main effect of anaesthesia (F\u202f=\u202f8.7,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.042) in the 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 ANOVA, with no effect of hemisphere (F\u202f=\u202f0.54,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.50) and no interaction between anaesthesia and hemisphere (F\u202f=\u202f0.008,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.93). Note however, that as the ROIs were defined from the awake state, activation was intentionally biased towards the awake state. \n\n\n### BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia \n  \nThe effect of anaesthesia on the t-score histograms from the tumour affected right hemisphere, is shown in  . In all patients, there was a leftward shift of the histogram indicating a reduction in the t-scores and the number of activated voxels surpassing the t-score threshold of 3.1 (  p  \u202f<\u202f0.001 ). BOLD sensitivities under general anaesthesia compared to awake were 7% (Patient C), 11% (Patient A), 26% (Patient D), 45% (Patient B) and 83% (Patient E). BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia correlated with the ratio of  /  (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.9,   p  \u202f=\u202f0.019) with increased sensitivity associated with a greater ratio.   \nThe figure illustrates the change in BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia. t-score histograms are shown for the patients A to E for activation in the right sensorimotor cortex (tumour affected hemisphere) resulting from left hand movement. The left histogram for each patient shows the t-score distribution of the voxels within the largest cluster of activation when awake (as listed in\u00a0Table 2). The right histogram illustrates how the distribution of the t-scores within this cluster is altered under general anaesthesia. Voxels whose t-scores were\u00a0\u2265\u202f0 are shown. The red dashed line indicates the t-score value 3.1 (p <\u202f0.001 ) which was selected to define voxel activation under anaesthesia. Activated voxels are those to the right of this cut-off. The total number of activated voxels when awake and under anaesthesia are listed. BOLD sensitivities (( / )\u00a0\u00d7100%) for the five patients\u00a0were: patient A 11% (16/147\u202f\u00d7\u202f100%), patient B 45% (102/226\u202f\u00d7\u202f100%), patient C 7% (13/178\u202f\u00d7\u202f100%), patient D 26% (65/246\u202f\u00d7\u202f100%), patient E 83% (71/86\u202f\u00d7\u202f100%). \n  Fig. 2   \n\n\n### Assessment for an association between BIS and sevoflurane to the BOLD response \n  \nThe scatter plots in   show the BIS values (3A,C) and the sevoflurane concentrations (3B,D) plotted against the ratio of  /  in each of the five patients. In none of these was there evidence of a clear trend for the ratio to either increase with BIS or to decrease with increasing sevoflurane and the Spearman's correlation coefficients (r ) for these did not meet statistical significance. For the BIS these were r \u202f=\u202f0.7 (  p   \u202f=\u202f0.094, one-tailed) for both the left hand and right hand. For the sevoflurane concentration, these were r \u202f=\u202f\u22120.6 (  p   \u202f=\u202f0.142, one-tailed) for the left hand and r \u202f\u202f=\u202f\u22120.1\u202f\u202f(  p  \u202f=\u202f0.436, one-tailed) for the right hand.   \nScatter plots show the Bispectral Index (BIS) (A,C) and the sevoflurane concentration (end-tidal %) (B,D) plotted against the BOLD ratio for the left hand (tumour affected hemisphere) and right\u00a0hand (tumour free hemisphere). The BOLD ratio is defined as:\u00a0 /  (using BOLD values to 4 DP). r \u00a0denotes the Spearman's correlation coefficient. \n  Fig. 3   \n\n\n### Clinical utility of anaesthesia fMRI data \n  \nIn all of the ten data sets, fMRI activation clusters under anaesthesia were assessed to be in the correct somatotopic region of the sensorimotor cortex, being wholly or at least partially encompassed by the cluster when the patients were awake ( ). Based upon this correct somatotopy, all ten acquisitions were scored to be useful for radiological neurosurgical guidance. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this prospective study we demonstrated that under conventional anaesthesia, using a simple non-invasive passive sensorimotor paradigm, task-related fMRI provides neurosurgically relevant functional information. In five patients with cerebral gliomas anaesthetised with a combination of sevoflurane, propofol and opioids, significant task-related BOLD activation has been reproducibly obtained in a 1.5T intra-operative MRI suite. The pharmacological agents used for anaesthesia reflect real life clinical practice as our goal was for the conditions to replicate those encountered within the intra-operative environment without any alteration in the anaesthetic regimen occurring as a consequence of participation in the study. The surgical depth of anaesthesia at the time of fMRI acquisition was measured and confirmed in each patient using the Bispectral index, a technique unique to this study. \n\nIn contrast to a previous peripheral nerve electrostimulation method used to elicit sensorimotor cortical activation in anaesthetised patients ( ,  ), the passive finger flexion paradigm performed replicates active finger movement fMRI paradigms which are performed pre-operatively in the work-up of neurosurgical patients. By performing the fMRI twice, firstly with the patients awake immediately prior to the onset of anaesthesia, we demonstrated the robust pattern of activation elicited by this paradigm. The paradigm was readily performed by a trained operator with no reliance on introducing additional specialist equipment into the iMRI environment, facilitating intra-operative implementation in anesthetised subjects. \n\nIn all patients the fMRI activations were in the correct somatotopic region of the sensorimotor cortex with the activation clusters under anaesthesia mostly reduced in extent compared to the awake state. Despite this reduction, all the activation clusters were observed with stringent statistical thresholding. In most cases these activations remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons across the whole brain (  p  \u202f<\u202f0.05), and all were significant after correction for multiple comparisons within the sensorimotor region or when using an uncorrected threshold of   p  \u202f<\u202f0.001. In contrast to previous studies (such as  ), we selected the same arbitrarily high threshold for each patient because the aim was to investigate reproducibility across the patient group. Even though cluster sizes were mostly reduced under anaesthesia these were unlikely to have represented false-positive activation because (a) they were in the expected somatotopic region of the pre-central and post-central gyri and (b) activation was demonstrated in this region when the paradigm was performed with the patients awake using a stringent statistical threshold of   p  \u202f<\u202f0.05 with whole-brain multiple comparison correction. \n\nThe magnitudes of the BOLD response under general anaesthesia were 25% (tumour affected hemisphere) and 22% (tumour free hemisphere) of those observed in the awake state. The use of the awake ROI was expected to bias this BOLD measurement towards the awake state, however a reduction in the task-related BOLD response following anaesthesia is in keeping with previous reports in animal ( ) and clinical studies ( ;  ), as is the reduction in the number of activated voxels ( ). Although we were not able to control for the effect of condition order (anaesthesia after awake) upon the BOLD response, a reduction in the magnitude of the task-related BOLD response under anaesthesia was expected because the anaesthetic agents, sevoflurane and propofol, are known to affect cerebral metabolism ( ;  ) through an inhibitory effect on neuronal activation secondary to their action on glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission ( ). A reduction in the BOLD response was also predicted by anaesthesia's perturbation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) which has indirectly been shown to modify the BOLD response ( ;  ). Previous human studies have shown sevoflurane and propofol to both increase ( ;  ) and decrease ( ) global CBF, though at a regional level sevoflurane has been shown to consistently reduce CBF within the fronto-parietal lobes, the location of the sensorimotor cortices, compared to the awake state ( ;  ). In these prior studies sevoflurane was administered at concentrations ranging from 0.5% ( ) to 4% ( ) with this range including the concentrations of the drug in the current study (range 1.54% to 2.37% ( )). More subtle, localised perturbation of CBF and neurovascular coupling within the sensorimotor cortex may in part, have accounted for the presence of activated voxels under anaesthesia which were not observed in the awake state (for patients A,B,D,E). \n\nAlterations in the BOLD response under anaesthesia could have also related to changes in carbon dioxide levels which have been shown to alter CBF ( ;  ) however as the carbon dioxide levels were controlled at the normal awake physiological range throughout the duration spent under anaesthesia, this is less likely to have been a contributory factor. The reduction in the task-related BOLD response may have also in part, related to the difference in voluntary motor activity when the patients performed the paradigm awake, though a previous study comparing activation elicited by active and passive finger motor tasks on awake subjects showed that BOLD activation in the passive state was comparable to that achieved in the active state ( ). \n\nConcomitant with a reduction in the magnitude of the task-related BOLD response, anaesthesia also reduced BOLD sensitivity, illustrated in  , with reduced t-scores observed for all five patients. BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia intuitively correlated with the ratio of  / . There was no clear relationship however between the BIS values or the sevoflurane concentration and this ratio ( ). As all patients were anaesthetised with sevoflurane, propofol, fentanyl and a continuous opioid infusion of remifentanil (except in patient D), it was expected that the BIS measurement would be the best overall measure of the depth of anaesthesia rather than relying solely on the sevoflurane concentration alone or an equivalent measure known as the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). The MAC value has been used in previous sevoflurane fMRI studies ( ;  ) and is known to be affected by propofol and opioid analgesics ( ). \n\nOverall, the change in the task-related BOLD response brought about by general anaesthesia is likely to reflect the complex effect that each of the anaesthetic agents sevoflurane and propofol have on neuronal metabolism, CBF and their combined effect. Individual patient differences in sensitivity to anaesthesia relating to age, gender and genetic factors ( ;  ;  ) likely also play contributory factors. The small sample in this study limits further interpretation of the effect of anaesthesia on the BOLD response and any association with the BIS and further larger patient studies using a similar quantification method of the depth of anaesthesia would be required to investigate this further. \n\nPrevious studies evaluating the effect of gliomas on the BOLD response have demonstrated reduced task activation in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the tumour using sensorimotor fMRI paradigms ( ) even when the tumours were not in direct contact with the sensorimotor cortex ( ;  ). In the current study none of the patients' tumours directly displaced the sensorimotor cortex, although three of the five tumours were in the frontal lobe with the tumours in patients B and D ( ) both within 2.0\u202fcm of the hand region of the primary motor cortex. Tumour volumes (except for patient E) were also comparable to those detailed in these previous fMRI studies. Despite these similarities in patient characteristics, we did not find a significant difference in the task-related BOLD response in either the tumour affected or tumour free hemispheres. In otherwords, the reduction in the BOLD response resulting from general anaesthesia was not greater in the tumour affected hemisphere compared with the tumour free hemisphere. This has important implications for the intra-operative acquisition of task-related fMRI using this technique in patients with tumours. \n\n### Study limitations \n  \nCurrently, obtaining access to fMRI in anesthetised human subjects remains extremely challenging: our study, in common with previous task-related fMRI studies performed under anaesthesia ( ;  ), was therefore restricted to a modest sized cohort of five patients. Nevertheless, the reproducibility of sensorimotor activation across a total of ten separate fMRI acquisitions suggest that using this paradigm BOLD activation can be obtained within the neurosurgical environment irrespective of patient demographics, differences in tumour characteristics, neurophysiological changes induced by general anaesthesia and, most importantly, the combined effect of multiple pharmacological dosages. The small sample size limits inferential power regarding the trend to association between anaesthesia and BOLD response changes, although our observations are consistent with prior literature. \n\nThe use of an operator dependent finger flexion paradigm may have resulted in slight differences in the timing and frequency of the movement between each patient's acquisition. To limit this potential variability the same trained clinician performed the finger flexion task in all five patients and our technical set-up ensured the paradigm timings were displayed in the intra-operative MRI operating room. Furthermore, our use of a blocked design paradigm versus an event-related design was predicted to limit any potential impact of slight variation across trials. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe acquisition of task-related BOLD fMRI in anaesthetised neurosurgical patients presents unique physiological, technical and clinical challenges. Despite this we demonstrated that without recourse to a study-specific anaesthesia protocol outside of routine practice, during deep unconsciousness elicited by conventional neurosurgical anaesthesia, task-related BOLD responses can be detected reproducibly. Further, this could be achieved using a simple passive sensorimotor paradigm readily implemented in the intra-operative situation. Despite the BOLD response being reduced under anaesthesia, fMRI activations were in the correct somatotopic brain region and judged useful to support clinical management. These results provide foundational evidence supporting the next step in the acquisition of fMRI intra-operatively under the conditions associated with the resection of brain tumours, that is general anaesthesia, craniotomy and exposure of the brain. Quantification of the depth of anaesthesia during fMRI may be of benefit in interpreting the activation data. These methods may also be of additional value outside of the intra-operative environment, for example enabling task-related fMRI in patients not able to perform or tolerate awake active paradigms, such as young children or claustrophobic patients and also in patients with movement disorders. \n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest \n  \nNone. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: t0005\n### Label: Table 1\nPatients\tA\tB\tC\tD\tE\nGender\tF\tF\tM\tM\tF\nAge/years\t34.9\t44.1\t25.5\t23.9\t40.2\nTumour location\tF\tF\tT\tF\tP\nTumour volume/cm3\t13.0\t36.5\t60.2\t38.2\t0.5\nTumour type\tOA (2)\tAO (3)\tOA (2)\tOA (2)\tOD (2)\nAnaesthesia: induction\t\t\t\t\t\nPropofol (mg)\t150\t200\t200\t170\t160\nFentanyl (mcg)\t300\t100\t100\t300\t100\nAtracurium (mg)\t50\t50\t50\t50\t50\nAnaesthesia: during fMRI\t\t\t\t\t\nSevoflurane (end tidal %)\t\t\t\t\t\nLeft hand (tumour)\t1.94\t1.54\t1.87\t2.29\t1.62\nRight hand (non tumour)\t1.83\t1.63\t1.87\t2.37\t1.61\nRemifentanil (mg/h)\t0.2\t0.2\t0.2\t\t0.2\nBIS\t48\t56\t29\t52\t34\n\t\t\t\t\t\nPhysiological variables\tPhysiological variables\tPhysiological variables\tPhysiological variables\tPhysiological variables\tPhysiological variables\nBlood pressure (mmHg)\t\t\t\t\t\nLeft hand (tumour)\t91/47\t74/38\t97/32\t78/46\t84/46\nRight hand (non tumour)\t91/47\t70/39\t89/32\t80/47\t85/47\nCarbon dioxide (kPa)\t\t\t\t\t\nLeft hand (tumour)\t4.5\t5.7\t4.7\t4.3\t4.3\nRight hand (non tumour)\t4.6\t4.1\t4.7\t4.3\t4.3\nOxygen saturation (%)\t\t\t\t\t\nLeft hand (tumour)\t100\t99\t100\t100\t100\nRight hand (non tumour)\t100\t99\t100\t100\t100\n### Caption\nThe table lists the demographical, clinical and anaesthesia details of the five patients (A to E) participating in the study. Gender F\u202f=\u202ffemale M\u202f=\u202fmale, Age\u202f=\u202fage in years at time of study entry. All patients had tumours in the right cerebral hemisphere and tumour location refers to the lobe containing the tumour (F\u202f=\u202ffrontal, T\u202f=\u202ftemporal, P\u202f=\u202fparietal). Tumour volume is in cm3\u00a0and was measured following manual segmentation using ITK-SNAP 3.6.0 (Yushkevich et al., 2006). Tumour type refers to the histological diagnosis of the tumour (OA\u202f=\u202foligoastrocytoma, AO\u202f=\u202fanaplastic oligodendroglioma, OD\u202f=\u202foligodendroglioma, 2\u202f=\u202fWHO grade II, 3\u202f=\u202fWHO grade III). Anaesthesia refers to the drugs and dosages (mg\u202f=\u202fmilligram, mcg\u202f=\u202fmicrogram, %) administered to the patients at induction of general anaesthesia (induction) and at the time of fMRI acquisition (during fMRI). For patient D, remifentanil was not administered (n/a\u202f=\u202fnot applicable). BIS refers to the Bispectral index measurement of the depth of anaesthesia at the time when the fMRI was acquired, with a level of <\u202f60 considered surgical anaesthesia.

{"text": "Tsai, Yu-Ping and Hung, Shih-Han and Huang, Tsung-Ren and Sullivan, William C. and Tang, Shih-An and Chang, Chun-Yen\nPLoS One, 2021\n\n# Title\n\nWhat part of the brain is involved in graphic design thinking in landscape architecture?\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nGraphic design thinking is a key skill for landscape architects, but little is known about the links between the design process and brain activity. Based on Goel\u2019s frontal lobe lateralization hypothesis (FLLH), we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the brain activity of 24 designers engaging in four design processes\u2014viewing, copy drawing, preliminary ideas, and refinement\u2014during graphic design thinking. The captured scans produced evidence of dramatic differences between brain activity when copying an existing graphic and when engaging in graphic design thinking. The results confirm that designs involving more graphic design thinking exhibit significantly more activity in the left prefrontal cortex. These findings illuminate the design process and suggest the possibility of developing specific activities or exercises to promote graphic design thinking in landscape architecture. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDesign thinking is a highly cognitive activity that is widely used in design-related fields to solve the problem in the man-made environment. \u201cDesign methodology,\u201d as described by Cross [ ], is the design process on work and thinking developed by designers through techniques or methods that reflect the knowledge to solve a problem. \u201cDesign as a discipline\u201d involves different perceptions in the sciences, humanities, and design thinking, knowing, and practical methods [ ,  ]. Hence, we could infer that design thinking involves a series of reasoning mechanisms to select, identify, and then solve the problem [ ,  ,  ]. This design process is called \u201creal-world problem solving\u201d with the \u201cselect-and-combine model\u201d [ ], which relates to the mechanism of conceptual sketches of cognition [ ] that might support the frontal lobe lateralization hypothesis (FLLH) in brain activations [ ]. Gero and Milovanovic [ ] considered that design thinking involves cognition, and researchers have tried to explore the design process through \u201cprotocol analysis,\u201d \u201cBlack Box experiment,\u201d and \u201csurvey\u201d during design. Goel [ ] demonstrated architectural designs that included initial sketching with ambiguous lines, conceptual transformation, analysis, and adjustment of the spatial form, gradually converging the style and precision of its spatial structure to solve current problems. By contrast, Gillieson and Garneau [ ] highlighted that graphic design thinking as a design process uses visual communication, such as organization and logic, to define deductive and inductive thinking in space, which also involves personal experiences to recall, reframe, and solve the design problem. Their study addressed the design process by drawing a series of graphics to identify the space in the landscape. Therefore, in this study, we used the term \u201cgraphic design thinking\u201d to explore the \u201cBlack Box\u201d in landscape architecture design. \n\nLaseau [ ] described a thinking process assisted by sketching, while Geol [ ] identified four characteristics in design, including problem structuring, preliminary design, refinement, and detail, which use sketching to refine ambiguous ideas in the related arts (e.g., architectural design). This suggests that designers think through sketching to visualize and spatialize a concept map within incomplete ideas and refine those thoughts through abductive thinking [ ]. Landscape architecture design consists of a set of design processes, including the scope of the problem, the purpose, and the goal, which interprets \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d through the selection of material, landscape elements, colors, etc. in the design process to meet needs and create values [ ]. The abductive thinking helps designers to develop ideas and connect elements for thought completion [ ]. Moreover, the voices of potential users and related stakeholders are important [ ]. After the development of the selected solution, the specific idea for actualizing the detailed design will be considered complete. Based on the concept of sketching-assisted thinking proposed by Laseau [ ], Geol [ ], and Kolko [ ], we might infer that, for landscape architects, the landscape architecture design process is associated with the conceptual stages of a project, as landscape architects use sketching to nurture creative ideas, and graphic design thinking refines the ideas to develop and connect landscape elements for completion. \n\nA study proposed a framework of using electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure brain activation, which could offer a glimpse of the design process, such as design creativity, design reasoning, and problem-solving, during different design tasks [ ]. fMRI may allow a better understanding of design cognition, such as visual and spatial reasoning, in design thinking and creativity [ ]. Goel [ ] proposed the FLLH, in which the left and right prefrontal cortices (PFC) are responsible for different functions in real-world problem-solving. The hypothesis links the design cognitive process to brain activity in architectural design and planning [ ]. The right PFC is involved in planning, visual processing, or reasoning out of the initial concept and preliminary ideas. The right PFC contributes to the abstract, vague, and conceptual aspects of performance. By contrast, after selecting a specific solution and proceeding to further refinement, the left PFC assists in processing specific, clear, and practical information ( ) [ ]. \n   The design process and corresponding brain reactions (modified from Goel, 2014).    \nThe involvement of the PFC in cognitive mechanisms has been proven in neuropsychology [ ]. Related research on architecture and interior studies in design results linked with brain activation. The specific design tasks replete with sketching the frame and design items in space in various forms prompted our research design. In their study, Goel and Grafman [ ] demonstrated that a patient with frontal lobe lesions who was an architect was unable to perform a preliminary design in sketching the ideas. However, normal subjects could perform the preliminary design, refinement, and detail through the design process in the open-end design. The finding highlights the role of the right PFC in design thinking tasks, consistent with other findings on interior design [ ,  ,  ]. Alexiou et al. [ ,  ] showed that when subjects in their study used a trackball mouse to move objects during interior design tasks (with no restriction), certain brain areas (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), middle frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus) were more active than during problem-solving tasks (with the conditions). These results were consistent with those of Gilbert et al. [ ], who found that the right DLPFC and left frontal lobe were more active, stimulating potential solutions within visual imagery in design tasks. Further, these studies indicated that during design tasks, the activation of ACC could relate to cognitive and emotional functions [ ,  ]. The DLPFC and ACC are not only involved in executive functions, such as visual imagery and semantic processing, but also work together to construct new ideas that respond to problem solving in design tasks [ ,  ]. \n\nDuring design, designers use sketching to draw preliminary ideas and refine them. Landscape architecture design deals with landscape elements, such as water, plants, and pavements, to integrate elements into a whole that form the compatibility in the space. Architectural design involves structures and coordination in buildings. The design process might be similar. A landscape architecture design involves problem structuring, preliminary design, refinement, and detail, which, as proposed by Geol [ ], could represent the graphic design thinking process of design with different elements in the landscape. Using fMRI could shed light on the \u201cBlack Box\u201d in the brain activation of landscape architects during the design process. To test the association between the different design processes and brain lateralization, this study explored the neural mechanisms associated with the graphic design thinking process by using a fMRI scan to identify parts of the brain that predominate during this phase of landscape architecture design. According to Goel [ ], the preliminary solution (or idea generation) phase activates the right PFC, whereas the refinement and detailing (or idea production) phase activates the left PFC. Thus, we hypothesized that the PFC would be activated during the landscape architecture design process as a key brain region that controls the design process. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe participants (N = 24; 10 males; mean age = 34.50 years; SD = 2.03 years) all had at least three years of training in landscape architecture design. All were right-handed, with normal vision and hearing; none had a history of neurological disorders or cardiovascular disease, and all were screened for MRI compatibility. Each participant gave their written informed consent to the protocol #201411HM024 \u201c  Neural Correlates of Landscape Design Creativity  :   An fMRI study  \u201d as approved by the Research Ethics Committee, Division of Research Ethics, Office of Research and Development, National Taiwan University. \n\n\n### Apparatus \n  \nTo test brain activity during landscape graphic design thinking, respondents were placed in an fMRI machine and asked to draw. However, as it is difficult to draw while lying in the fMRI machine, most researchers in previous studies asked participants to verbally describe, silently imagine their ideas, or click and remove the design items during the experiment, later drawing or writing down their ideas from memory outside the machine [ ,  \u2013 ]. In the present study, as the time difference between brain activity and reporting was problematic, we created a tilting acrylic table in the fMRI machine using a shoulder fixation cushion to help participants draw their designs while their brains were being scanned. The table was positioned over the participant\u2019s waist ( ). The experimental tasks on the table were printed and bound on paper and were easily visible with a double mirror on an overhead coil. Participants turned the page to the next task after hearing a beep in their headphones. While performing the tasks, the participants were asked to move only their lower arm to reduce movement and unnecessary scanning noise. \n   The scanning environment.    \n\n### Stimuli \n  \nThe tasks involved two kinds of stimuli. The first task was to complete landscape plans from the book   From Concept to Form in Landscape Design   [ ]. The second task involved illustrations containing five geometric shapes ( ) to form a landscape, which included in holistic work of visual imagery, abstract reasoning, or refinement in the graphic design thinking procedure and complete in the design task. A total of four \u201cviewing landscapes\u201d and four \u201clandscape architecture designs with geometric shapes\u201d were arranged differently for the subjects in the research design. \n   Examples of geometric cues as experimental stimuli.    \n\n### Procedure \n  \nThe experiment was designed to understand brain activity during the landscape architecture design process. The landscape graphic design process includes preliminary ideas, in which the participants think of initial solutions to the refinement problem-solving step. In the refinement phase, the subjects drew and refined their ideas during graphic design thinking, which we assumed activated the left PFC. Two types of tasks were provided in the experiments. The first task involved drawing without graphic design thinking (Task A-control), while the second task involved design cued by simple geometric forms for designing a landscape (Task B-design). To manage the effects of motion, each stimulus was presented twice, yielding four experimental conditions: \u201cviewing\u201d a complete landscape plan (A-1); \u201ccopying\u201d this landscape plan on tracing paper (A-2); \u201cpreliminary ideas,\u201d using geometric illustrations to envision a landscape architecture design (idea generation) (B-1); and \u201crefinement\u201d of the ideas, which uses designing skill to produce the preliminary ideas, reasoning, and drawing of landscape elements (idea production), consistent with the description of graphic design thinking assisted by sketching (B-2). The participants were requested to draw by their hands only during the experiment in the \u201ccopy drawing\u201d and \u201crefinement\u201d conditions. \n\nThe research design followed the characteristic of design [ ]. In the \u201cviewing\u201d condition, participants were asked to imagine that they were in the environment that the plan presented. In the \u201ccopy drawing\u201d condition, participants were asked to trace the landscape plan on a tracing paper without any design. In the \u201cpreliminary ideas\u201d condition, participants were asked to use several geometric illustrations to envision a landscape architecture design in their mind. In the \u201crefinement\u201d condition, participants were asked to draw the design they thought of in the preliminary ideas session. Based on the different stimuli, participants first copied the landscape plans and then used the geometric forms to develop a plan, section, or perspective drawing of their design according to their own preference. Each condition allowed 60 seconds for completion. During fMRI scanning, the participants completed two runs, which meant that each functional scan included four sessions and lasted for 558 seconds. The participants were randomly assigned to one of the counterbalancing task sequences, ABAB BABA or BABA ABAB ( ). \n   The fMRI experimental process.    \n\n### Evaluation of the \u201crefinement\u201d stage in graphic design thinking scores \n  \nTo validate the results of the brain activation experiment, behavioral performance was measured to verify the level of \u201crefinement\u201d in graphic design thinking. Since graphic design thinking assisted by sketching to form design ideas, which might relate to developing creative design ideas, we used the concept of creativity to evaluate it. Previous research has indicated that qualitative research on creativity should be conducted in domain-specific ways [ ]. Because there is no standard method for evaluating creative landscape architecture design, we used the indicators in the Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults (ATTA) as our evaluation instrument. The ATTA is a validated creativity assessment instrument that asks subjects about the suitability of writing or drawing in a test of graphic design thinking. The content and volume of ideas in the drawings are used as objective indicators of a designer\u2019s creativity. According to Guilford\u2019s concept of creative thinking, four indicators\u2014fluency, originality, elaboration, and flexibility\u2014were used to rate the volume of ideas, novelty of concepts, level of detail, and diversity of ideas. \n\nTo evaluate the level of refinement in participants\u2019 graphic design creative thinking, we invited 10 senior landscape experts to assess the drawings on a 10-point Likert scale. Based on Guilford\u2019s concept of creative thinking and the Torrance test, creativity levels were assessed in terms of three components: fluency, originality, and elaboration [ ].   Fluency   refers to the quantity of ideas produced; creative people are able to produce more ideas.   Originality   refers to ideas that are unusual, novel, unique, and different from others.   Elaboration   refers to the details considered and depicted over and above the core concept. Flexibility, the fourth component of creativity in the Torrance test, which tests the diversity of ideas, was not included in this study, as the experimental tasks provided geometric forms that limited the respondent\u2019s flexibility. The score of each participant\u2019s \u201crefinement\u201d level in the graphic design thinking was based on the average of the ten experts\u2019 scores on the three relevant components. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nImages were acquired by a 3T SIEMENS MAGNETOM Prisma MRI with a 20-channel head coil. For each participant, a T2-weighted anatomical was obtained (TR = 9530 ms, TE = 103 ms, flip angle = 150\u00b0, field of view = 192\u00d7192 mm , x-y voxel size = 0.66\u00d70.5 mm , 3mm thick). Two-dimensional echo-planar images (EPI) were acquired with a GRAPPA acceleration factor of two at repetition time TR = 3000 ms, echo time TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, field of view = 192\u00d7192 mm , matrix size = 64\u00d764\u00d745, and an effective resolution of 3\u00d73\u00d73 mm . In total, 45 EPI slices were sampled in a bottom-up, interleaved order. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nFMRI images were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM8 software in MATLAB. The data for each participant were preprocessed as follows. First, slice timing was used to correct the timing of the functional series by using the middle slice as the reference point. Second, images were realigned to the first scan to correct translational and rotational motion within the subject throughout the time series. Third, using coregistration algorithms, the anatomical image (higher resolution image) was coregistered to functional images, providing better normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template. As the next step in normalization of the functional image, the segment procedure divided the anatomical image into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. Next, the normalization step transformed the realigned functional image data from each individual subject to fit a standardized space, enabling the comparison of brains of varying shapes and sizes. Lastly, the smoothing procedure compensated for the remaining difference between subjects by applying an 8\u00d78\u00d78 mm  Gaussian smoothing kernel filter. \n\nWhole-brain analyses were estimated voxel by voxel according to a general linear model. Individual statistical maps modeled the time series using regressors and covariates. The covariates were yield movement parameters during the realigning process to control variance due to head movement. The regressors of interest included viewing (A1), copy drawing (A2), preliminary ideas (B1), and refinement (B2) sessions for each participant. In a second-level analysis, the group random effect was assessed for each contrast between participants. Significant regions of brain activation were evaluated by a one-sample t-test to determine whether the mean activation value across participants differed significantly from zero. \n\nAccording to the assumption of pure insertion, neural structures underlay a single process. First, we compared the difference between \u201cpreliminary ideas (B1)\u201d and \u201cviewing (A1)\u201d to understand the design brain of provide preliminary ideas. Both of these two conditions involve the cognitive brain, which includes visual imagery to transport oneself into the landscape, but the \u201cpreliminary ideas\u201d condition also engages the brain in generating ideas. Second, the brain region associated with the difference between \u201c\u201drefinement\u201d (B2)\u201d and \u201ccopy drawing (A2)\u201d was identified to isolate the graphic design thinking activity. Both of these two conditions engage the brain in drawing a landscape, but the \u201cgraphic design thinking\u201d condition also involves the brain in the refinement of the design. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Sanity check \n  \nTo ensure a confident answer to the question of which brain area performs graphic design thinking, we first conducted a sanity check. First, we checked each subject\u2019s translational and rotational motion during the functional scans. Both translational and rotational motion not exceed 5mm and 5 degrees was acceptable. The overall motion in each run showed in  . Second, as the experiments included two distinct conditions (with and without hand movements), we analyzed the differences between them to assess whether the primary motor cortex was activated [ ]. \n   Average framewise displacement during the functional scans.      \n#### Copy drawing (A2) versus viewing (A1) \n  \nWe observed \u201ccopy drawing (A2)\u201d versus \u201cviewing (A1)\u201d at a threshold of p < 0.05 FEW-corrected, extent threshold k > 20 voxels (see   and  ). This result indicates that the main area of brain activity was the left precentral gyrus ( ), which controls primary motion. Additionally, left-brain activation responded to right-hand movement. \n   Brain activation for copy drawing (A2) versus viewing (A1) (coronal section).       Brain activation for copy drawing (A2) versus viewing (A1).       Brain activation for copy drawing (A2) versus viewing (A1).      \n\n#### Refinement (B2) versus preliminary ideas (B1) \n  \nThe result of \u201crefinement (B2)\u201d versus \u201cpreliminary ideas (B1)\u201d at a threshold of p < 0.05 FEW-corrected and extent threshold of k > 20 voxels (  and  ) showed the left precentral gyrus as the main area of brain activation. This area controls primary motion and is consistent with the expected results for right-hand movement ( ). \n   Brain activation for refinement (B2) versus preliminary ideas (B1) (coronal section).       Brain activation for refinement (B2) versus preliminary ideas (B1).       Brain activation for refinement (B2) versus preliminary ideas (B1).      \nThe sanity check showed that when participants saw the same stimulus with and without hand movement, there was a difference in the activation of the primary motor cortex. As this confirms that the participants followed the instructions, the collected data could be utilized for the indicated purposes. \n\n\n\n### Hypothesis testing of the design process \n  \nThe study hypothesis was designed to test the relationship between design activity and the prefrontal cortex. While the preliminary ideas (idea generation) phase activated the right PFC, the refinement (idea production) phase activated the left PFC. \n\n#### Preliminary ideas (B1) versus viewing (A1) \n  \nWe did not find differences in BOLD signals between the \u201cdesign without drawing (B1)\u201d and \u201cviewing (A1)\u201d conditions at the threshold p < 0.05 FEW-corrected and extent threshold k > 20 voxels. \n\n\n#### Refinement (B2) versus copy drawing (A2) \n  \nFor \u201crefinement\u201d versus \u201ccopy drawing,\u201d activation was observed in the left middle frontal gyrus (peak x, y, z = -52, 20, 30; t = 8.28), which formed part of the DPFC functional region (  and  ). As this brain region is in charge of cognitive processes, including working memory, cognitive flexibility, and planning [ ], there is support for the hypothesis that the left PFC is responsible for refinement (idea production). \n   Brain activation for refinement (B2) versus copy drawing (A2).       Activation peaks for refinement (B2) versus copy drawing (A2).      \n\n\n### The relationship between brain activation parameters and refinement in graphic design thinking scores \n  \n#### Refinement in graphic design thinking evaluation \n  \nInter-judge reliability was quite consistent among the 10 senior experts from the Council of Landscape Architecture Association. They awarded a mean score of 4.60 (SD = 0.75) for refinement in graphic design thinking (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.895). \n\n\n#### Correlation of the level of brain activation parameters and refinement in graphic design thinking scores \n  \nWe compared the designers\u2019 work, specifically at the level of refinement in graphic design thinking, with the brain activity results. The scores correlated significantly with the Beta value (BOLD-magnitude of brain activation) of \u201crefinement versus copy drawing\u201d in the left middle frontal gyrus (r = 0.473, p < 0.05) ( ). \n   Correlation of brain activation parameters and refinement in graphic design thinking scores.    \n\n\n\n## Discussion and conclusions \n  \nBased on these findings, the left middle frontal gyrus, which forms part of the PFC, contributed to graphic design thinking in the refinement steps of landscape architecture design (idea production). During the landscape architecture design process, the designers drew and thought simultaneously. The use of paper and pen, as in the real world, helped designers engage in graphic design thinking, which may explain the confirmation of the hypothesis that the PFC was active during idea production. \n\nOur results failed to confirm that right PFC activity is associated with the preliminary ideas (idea generation) phase. Having controlled for the imaginary landscape by analyzing \u201cpreliminary ideas versus viewing\u201d (both of which are needed to imagine environmental space but differ in relation to graphic design thinking), there was no brain region activity shown for this phase in this study. It is possible that the imaginary landscape could not evoke sufficient graphic design thinking that can be captured in the brain result. \n\nThe left and right PFCs play different roles in the design process. Goel [ ] proposed the FLLH to explain the relationship between the design process and brain activity. We found support for the hypothesis that the left PFC is involved in the refinement phases. Furthermore, the correlation analysis of refinement in graphic design thinking scores and the contrast between \u201crefinement in graphic design thinking versus copy drawing\u201d demonstrated a positive association with activation of the left middle frontal gyrus, which is part of the left PFC. Higher scores were related to higher activation in the left PFC. Several studies have used methods such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to improve creative performance [ ], suggesting a new direction for further study involving stimulation of the left middle prefrontal brain area to improve design skills. \n\nThe present results confirm that the left middle frontal gyrus is involved in graphic design thinking in landscape architecture design and can be linked to the idea production phase of creativity [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Besides graphic design thinking, these findings also relate to other elements, such as emotions and personal experiences [ ,  ,  ,  ]. The landscape architecture design process, as it unfolds in the designer\u2019s brain, warrants further experiment-based research to address a number of questions. First, how does emotion impact the designer while engaged in landscape architecture design, and how is the brain activated during different phases of the design experience? Second, what do differences between experts and non-experts reveal about the characteristics of the designer\u2019s brain? There is also more to be learned about the mechanisms of creativity and methods for training our brains to be more innovative. Further research could consider other experimental tasks or repeat more tasks to maximize evoked changes in brain activation. Moreover, limited to the experimental tasks printed and bound on paper, the task sequence in this study has only two counterbalancing versions. It is better to randomize the experimental tasks to avoid ordering effect. These preliminary pilot experiment results will be further analyzed, developed, and replicated in pursuing this psychological line of investigation into the links between the process of landscape architecture design and human brain activity. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone.0258413.t001\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tTranslation (mm)\tTranslation (mm)\tTranslation (mm)\tRotation (degres)\tRotation (degres)\tRotation (degres)\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tx\ty\tz\tpitch\troll\tyaw\nRun1\t0.10\u00b10.14\t0.15\u00b10.17\t0.35\u00b10.27\t0.01\u00b10.01\t0.00\u00b10.00\t0.00\u00b10.00\nRun2\t0.06\u00b10.03\t0.11\u00b10.13\t0.27\u00b10.25\t0.00\u00b10.00\t0.00\u00b10.00\t0.00\u00b10.00\n### Caption\nAverage framewise displacement during the functional scans.\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: pone.0258413.t002\n### Label: Table 2\nBrain region\tBrain region\tMNI-coordinates\tMNI-coordinates\tMNI-coordinates\tt\tPFWE\tNumber of voxels\nBrain region\tBrain region.1\tx\ty\tz\tUnnamed: 5_level_1\tUnnamed: 6_level_1\tNumber of voxels\n(L)\tPrecentral gyrus\t-32\t-18\t50\t15.4\t0.0\t5100\n(R)\tCerebellum anterior lobe\t14\t-52\t-16\t14.72\t0.0\t2393\n(L)\tInferior frontal gyrus\t-56\t8\t24\t12.1\t0.0\t463\n(R)\tInferior frontal gyrus\t56\t8\t26\t10.63\t0.0\t306\n(R)\tSuperior parietal lobule (BA7)\t18\t-56\t60\t10.29\t0.0\t1430\n(R)\tFrontal lobe sub-gyrus\t24\t-2\t54\t9.64\t0.0\t238\n(L)\tPrecentral gyrus (BA6)\t-48\t-4\t6\t7.38\t0.003\t25\n(L)\tInferior temporal gyrus (BA37)\t-48\t-68\t-2\t7.13\t0.006\t98\n(R)\tMiddle temporal gyrus (BA37)\t52\t-58\t-6\t6.8\t0.01\t50\n### Caption\nBrain activation for copy drawing (A2) versus viewing (A1).\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: pone.0258413.t003\n### Label: Table 3\nBrain region\tBrain region\tMNI-coordinates\tMNI-coordinates\tMNI-coordinates\tt\tPFWE\tNumber of voxels\nBrain region\tBrain region.1\tx\ty\tz\tUnnamed: 5_level_1\tUnnamed: 6_level_1\tNumber of voxels\n(R)\tCerebellum anterior lobe\t6\t-66\t-16\t15.65\t0.0\t4443\n(L)\tPrecentral gyrus\t-30\t-24\t58\t15.54\t0.0\t8190\n(R)\tInferior frontal gyrus\t56\t8\t26\t14.69\t0.0\t653\n(R)\tPrecuneus\t16\t-56\t58\t12.57\t0.0\t1723\n(R)\tMiddle occipital gyrus (BA19)\t50\t-58\t-8\t9.46\t0.0\t682\n(L)\tMiddle occipital gyrus (BA37)\t-44\t-70\t0\t8.76\t0.0\t245\n(L)\tInferior occipital gyrus\t-38\t-86\t-6\t8.47\t0.001\t70\n(L)\tThalamus\t-12\t-18\t8\t6.69\t0.013\t22\n### Caption\nBrain activation for refinement (B2) versus preliminary ideas (B1).\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: pone.0258413.t004\n### Label: Table 4\nBrain region\tBrain region\tMNI-coordinates\tMNI-coordinates\tMNI-coordinates\tt\tPFWE\tNumber of voxels\nBrain region\tBrain region.1\tx\ty\tz\tUnnamed: 5_level_1\tUnnamed: 6_level_1\tNumber of voxels\n(L)\tMiddle Frontal Gyrus\t-52\t20\t30\t8.28\t0.001\t100\n### Caption\nActivation peaks for refinement (B2) versus copy drawing (A2).\n### Footer\nNone\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8699602, "text_md5": "b5a4a88f5bd78fd84f09b6427b71374b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 116], "journal": [117, 125], "publication_year": [127, 131], "title": [142, 230], "keywords": [244, 244], "abstract": [257, 1175], "body": [1184, 27354], "tables": [27367, 29683]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 34941895, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0258413", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8699602", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8699602"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8699602\">8699602</a>", "list_title": "PMC8699602  What part of the brain is involved in graphic design thinking in landscape architecture?"}

To achieve this promise of rtfMRI-nf, we introduced and demonstrated a data-driven framework to design a rtfMRI-nf intervention through the discovery of precise target location associated with clinical symptoms and neurofeedback signal optimization. Specifically, we identified the functional connectivity locus associated with rumination symptoms, utilizing a connectome-wide search in resting-state fMRI data from a large cohort of mood and anxiety disorder individuals (  N  \u00a0=\u00a0223) and healthy controls (  N  \u00a0=\u00a045). Then, we performed a rtfMRI simulation analysis to optimize the online functional connectivity neurofeedback signal for the identified functional connectivity. The connectome-wide search was performed in the medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus brain regions to identify the precise location of the functional connectivity associated with rumination severity as measured by the ruminative response style (RRS) scale. The analysis found that the functional connectivity between the loci in the precuneus (-6, \u221254, 48\u00a0mm in MNI) and the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ; 49, \u221249, 23\u00a0mm) was positively correlated with RRS scores (depressive,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001; brooding,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001; reflective,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.002) in the mood and anxiety disorder group. We then performed a rtfMRI processing simulation to optimize the online computation of the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity. We determined that the two-point method without a control region was appropriate as a functional connectivity neurofeedback signal with less dependence on signal history and its accommodation of head motion. The present study offers a discovery framework for the precise location of functional connectivity targets for rtfMRI-nf intervention, which could help directly translate neuroimaging findings into clinical rtfMRI-nf interventions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nNeurofeedback is a noninvasive technique of intervening in human brain activity ( ). In neurofeedback training, a feedback signal of on-going brain activation is presented to participants to help them self-regulate their brain activity through learning to modulate the signal. A promising application of this intervention is a clinical treatment of psychiatric disorders via normalization of abnormal brain activation as a result of the training ( ;  ;  ). Designing a neurofeedback protocol involves the identification of the target brain activation associated with a disorder symptom. In this regard, real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) has a distinct advantage over other neurofeedback modalities, such as electroencephalography and/or near-infrared spectroscopy, in localizing a target region anywhere in the brain with high spatial resolution. fMRI is also the most popular neuroimaging method for mapping human brain function as well as altered function in a disease state. RtfMRI-nf can take advantage of the results of such fMRI functional mapping studies to determine the intervention target. The activation measure of rtfMRI-nf can either be activity at a specific region of interest (ROI), functional connectivity between regions, or a pattern of multiple regions\u2019 activity ( ). Thus, with its high spatial specificity and broad applicability of functional measurement, rtfMRI-nf can be a direct way of translating neuroscience knowledge into a clinical intervention. \n\nIn designing a rtfMRI-nf treatment protocol, abnormal brain activity associated with a disorder symptom is determined as a neurofeedback target, with the assumption that normalizing an abnormal brain activation could alleviate disorder symptoms. Two major approaches have been used for neurofeedback target determination ( ). One approach involves referring to previous research characterizing disease-specific abnormal brain responses to identify a specific anatomical location associated with the disease. RtfMRI-nf can take advantage of the outcomes of abundant neuroimaging research, including systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis studies, to identify the neurofeedback target. This approach, however, cannot fully utilize the high spatial specificity of rtfMRI-nf. The result of a systematic review that summarizes studies with different specific aims based on a region name of atlas-based nomenclature does not indicate the exact location of abnormal brain activation. While quantitative meta-analysis, such as activation likelihood estimation (ALE) ( ), can indicate a coordinate of the region involved in the disease, meta-analysis usually includes studies with broadly different aims or tasks. Thus, the identified locus may not be the region of specific functional abnormality but an overlap of blurred activation maps for different functions. \n\nAnother approach to identifying the rtfMRI-nf target is a functional localizer scan ( ;  ). This approach performs a task that can elucidate a specific functional abnormality in fMRI and finds a locus of abnormal brain activation for each participant. This approach has a significant advantage in pinpointing the personalized target location, and researchers can fully take advantage of the high-spatial specificity of rtfMRI-nf. However, it is not always possible to fully utilize this approach since not all diseases have an established localizer task to identify abnormalities, and some tasks may not be applicable to patients with severe symptoms. For example, showing negative pictures repetitively to depressed patients could be harmful to their mood and possibly worsen their symptoms. Also, if the abnormality is expressed as a non-activation, we cannot locate the position of abnormality with a localizer scan ( ). \n\nThe present study introduced an alternative approach for data-driven and process-based neurofeedback target identification based on big data of resting-state fMRI, specifically for functional connectivity rtfMRI-nf. The data-driven approach can identify the exact location of abnormal brain activation by analyzing the original data, which is not performed in review or meta-analysis studies. Although the approach based on population data cannot personalize the target location like the functional localizer, it can identify the location with a non-active or low-connectivity abnormality through a comparison between disease and control groups. In addition, a resting-state fMRI scan is applicable to any patient population and could indicate an abnormality as a therapeutic target ( ). \n\nFurthermore, if the dataset for identifying the target includes samples with a wide range of symptom spectrum measures across diagnostic groups, we can identify the locus of brain activation associated with symptom dimension. As the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework highlighted ( ;  ), current diagnostic systems for mental disorders are not based on neurobiological alterations, and the connection between diagnosis and underlaying neurobiology has not been established. The rtfMRI-nf intervention cannot be a full-fledged clinical treatment with such uncertainty and variability of neurobiological abnormality. A process-based framework of rtfMRI-nf ( ) has been proposed for precise intervention to accommodate such neurobiological variability in a diagnostic group. This framework identifies the neurofeedback target associated with a specific functional process of pathological abnormality instead of the average difference between disease and control groups. The data-driven approach can identify such a process-based target via direct access to the original data. A functional localizer cannot identify the locus associated with dimensional abnormality because the abnormality can be characterized only with a distribution of population data, not with one individual data point. Taken together, the data-driven process-based approach could be an optimal way to identify a neurofeedback target to make good use of the advantage of rtfMRI-nf. \n\nTo establish this approach, we need a dataset with large sample size, including a range of diagnostic groups and comprehensive measures of functional dimensions. The Tulsa 1000 study provides the ideal dataset for this purpose ( ). The dataset includes both healthy participants and those with a psychiatric diagnosis with comprehensive measurements of biological and behavioral assessment, including fMRI and symptom scales. Using this dataset, the present study aimed to identify the functional connectivity locus associated with a specific symptom, rumination in mood and anxiety disorder participants, as a target of future rtfMRI-nf intervention. \n\nRumination has been defined as \u201cthe process of thinking perseveratively about one's feelings and problems rather than in terms of the specific content of thoughts\u201d ( ). Rumination and associated repetitive negative thinking are a pervasive symptom observed in multiple psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, obsessive-compulsive disorder, binge eating, and self-injurious behavior ( ;  ). Ruminative response style to a traumatic event also mediates the development of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms ( ). Rumination could exacerbate depression symptoms by enhancing the effect of depressed mood with repetitive thinking of negative thoughts and by interfering with problem solving ( ). Ruminative response style is also a predictive factor of major depressive episodes ( ). These indicate that rumination is a promising target for treatment to alleviate disorder symptoms as well as prevent symptom development across diagnoses. Indeed, cognitive behavioral therapies targeting rumination showed an effect of decreasing depressive symptoms ( ;  ;  ). \n\nNeurobiologically, cortical midline structures ( ;  ) involved in the default mode network (DMN) have been implicated in rumination and associated self-referential thinking ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ). Specifically, two core parts of the structure, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/Prec) regions have been implicated in self-referential processing as well as pathological rumination due to their abnormal activity ( ;  ;  ) and altered functional connectivity ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nThe current study searched for the precise locus of functional connectivity associated with rumination symptom severity for mood and anxiety disorder patients. The brain areas involved in this search included the MPFC and PCC/Prec regions. While studies indicate that functional connectivity in either the MPFC or PCC/Prec was associated with rumination, most of the studies used an   a priori  -defined seed region based on an anatomical atlas and did not perform a voxel-wise search for the seed and its connectivity. As these areas are not functionally homogeneous ( ;  ;  ), an   a priori   definition of the seed ROI could misidentify the precise location of the connectivity associated with rumination symptom. While   and   examined voxel-wise resting-state functional connectivity to find altered connectivity in participants with major depressive disorder compared to controls, they did not search for and determine connectivity correlated with rumination symptom severity. They, instead, searched the connectivity with group difference and evaluated a correlation with rumination in a post-hoc analysis. Thus, the precise locus of functional connectivity associated with rumination severity that can serve as a neurofeedback target with high-spatial specificity has not yet been identified. \n\nTo identify the precise location of the functional connectivity associated with rumination severity, the present study performed a connectome-wide association analysis ( ;  ). The connectome-wide analysis investigates comprehensive voxel-wise connectivity associations ( ) utilizing multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR) analysis ( ). This analysis examines voxel-wise connectivity association without   a priori   seed definition. We performed MDMR for resting-state fMRI data in the Tulsa 1000 study dataset with a regressor of rumination symptoms derived from the Ruminative Response Styles (RRS) scale ( ). We supposed that this analysis could enable us to identify the locus of functional connectivity significantly associated with rumination severity in mood and anxiety disorders, which can serve as a rtfMRI-nf target. \n\nAdditionally, we performed a simulation analysis to design an optimal real-time neurofeedback signal, following a framework introduced by  . This optimization with simulation is an additional benefit of accessing original data when designing a rtfMRI-nf treatment protocol. The simulation analysis was performed for the functional connectivity identified in the connectome-wide analysis described above. Two measures of online functional connectivity, sliding-window correlation and the two-point algorithm ( ), were evaluated. Through a data-driven search for the precise location of connectivity associated with rumination severity and optimization of a connectivity-based neurofeedback signal, we introduced and demonstrated a data-driven, process-based framework of designing a rtfMRI-nf treatment protocol with precise targeting and an optimally designed neurofeedback signal. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Data \n  \nData of 268 participants including a mood and/or anxiety disorder group (MA;   N  \u00a0=\u00a0223, 162 females, mean (SD) age\u00a0=\u00a036 (11) years, 147 participants were medicated) and a healthy control group (HC;   N  \u00a0=\u00a045, 23 females, mean (SD) age\u00a0=\u00a032 (11) years) from the Tulsa 1000 study ( ) were used in the analysis. Of the note, the participants were selected from the first 500 subjects (exploratory dataset out of 1000 subjects study cohort) of Tulsa 10,000 study. The diagnosis was based on an abbreviated version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI V.6.0) ( ). MA group includes participants with either mood disorder symptoms, anxiety disorder symptoms, or both with MINI. While the majority of their primary diagnoses were major depressive disorder or general anxiety disorder, they also included comorbidity of social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and alcohol dependence. We included these diagnostically heterogeneous populations following a trans-diagnostic approach of RDoC to search for a neurobiological basis of the specific symptom dimension, rumination. \n\nRumination was evaluated with the Ruminative Response Styles (RRS) scale ( ). The total score of RRS as well as its sub-scores of depressive, brooding, and reflective rumination ( ) were used as a regressor for resting-state functional connectivity patterns in the MDMR analysis. Rumination is a multidimensional construct and its depressive and brooding components are considered maladaptive processes associated with disorder symptoms, while its reflective component could be an adaptive process ( ). Hence, the neuropathology associated with depressive and brooding rumination could be a target of intervention. We also used the depression and anxiety scales in the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) ( ) to examine their effects on the connectivity pattern. The MDMR analysis was performed independently for each symptom scale. \n\nResting-state fMRI data were collected on a whole-body 3 Tesla MR750 MRI scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) with an 8-channel receive-only head array coil at the Laureate Institute of Brain Research. Participants were instructed not to move and to relax and rest while looking at a cross on the screen during an 8-min resting-state scan. A single-shot gradient-recalled echo-planner imaging (EPI) sequence with sensitivity encoding (SENSE) was used with imaging parameters of TR/TE\u00a0=\u00a02000/27\u00a0ms, FA\u00a0=\u00a078\u00b0, FOV\u00a0=\u00a0240\u00a0mm, 39 axial slices with 2.9\u00a0mm thickness without gap, matrix\u00a0=\u00a096\u00d796, SENSE acceleration factor   R  \u00a0=\u00a02, sampling bandwidth\u00a0=\u00a0250\u00a0kHz. The EPI images were reconstructed into a 128\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0128 matrix resulting in 1.875\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.875\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.9\u00a0mm  voxel volume. For anatomical reference, T1-weighted MRI images with a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence with parameters of FOV\u00a0=\u00a0240\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0190\u00a0mm, matrix\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256, 120 axial slices, slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a00.9\u00a0mm, 0.9375\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.9375\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.9\u00a0mm  voxel volume, TR/TE\u00a0=\u00a05/2\u00a0ms, SENSE acceleration   R  \u00a0=\u00a02, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a08\u00b0, delay/inversion time TD/TI\u00a0=\u00a01400/725\u00a0ms, sampling bandwidth\u00a0=\u00a031.2\u00a0kHz, scan time\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0min 40\u00a0s, were also acquired. \n\n\n### Connectome-wide association analysis \n  \nPreprocessing of functional images was performed with Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) ( ). The initial five volumes were excluded from the analysis. The preprocessing included despiking, RETROICOR ( ) and RVT ( ) physiological noise corrections, slice-timing correction, motion corrections, nonlinear warping to the MNI template brain with resampling to 2\u00a0mm  voxels using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) ( ) ( ), smoothing with 6mm-FWHM kernel, and scaling to percent change relative to the mean signal in each voxel. General linear model (GLM) analysis was performed with regressors of 12 motion parameters (three rotations, three shifts, and their temporal derivatives), three principal components of ventricle signals, local white matter average signals (ANATICOR ( )), 4th-order Legendre polynomials for high-pass filtering, and censoring TRs with large head motion (> 0.25\u00a0mm frame-wise displacement). Voxel-wise residual signals of the GLM were used for the connectome-wide analysis. \n\nConnectome-wide investigation was performed in two steps; identification of the seed area with MDMR and a post-hoc traditional seed-based analysis for the identified seed. The first step examined the association between whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) from a seed voxel and a symptom scale using MDMR analysis ( ;  ). We followed the procedure described in detail in  , and scripts for the analysis are available at GitHub ( ). Briefly, the processed resting-state fMRI images were down-sampled to 4mm  voxels, and then the voxels in gray matter regions were extracted. A connectivity map (z-transformed Pearson correlation) was made from each voxel to all other voxels. The dependent variable of MDMR is a distance matrix of the connectivity maps between participants. The distance of the maps was calculated with Euclidean distance of the connectivity maps. The MDMR analysis evaluates the association between the distance matrix and the predictor variables with a linear model. The model includes a symptom score, group (MA/HC), and their interaction, as well as gender, medication status, age, and motion (mean frame-wise displacement) as covariates. The result of MDMR was represented with an   F   value that was the ratio of the variance explained by a certain regressor relative to the residual variance ( ;  ). A permutation test was performed to test the significance of the statistic, in which regressors of interest (symptom score, group, and their interaction) were orthogonalized with regard to nuisance regressors, and then the orthogonalized regressors of interest were randomly permuted ( ). Ten thousand random permutations were performed. \n\nThese procedures were repeated for individual voxels within the MPFC and PCC/Prec regions. The MPFC and PPC/Prec region masks were extracted from the DMN map obtained from 405 healthy participants' resting-state fMRI data ( ) provided at  . One cluster in the MPFC and four clusters in the PCC and the precuneus in the DMN were used as the MPFC and PCC/Prec masks, respectively ( A). The MDMR analysis was performed for the MPFC and PCC/Prec regions, separately. The MDMR statistical map was thresholded with voxel-wise   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.005 and cluster-size corrected   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05. Cluster-size corrected   p  -value was evaluated with the same permutation procedure as the voxel-wise test.   \nMDMR analysis mask and results. a) Masks of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC, red) and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/Prec, cyan) regions, where MDMR analysis was performed. b)   F  -value map of the reflective RRS effect on the connectivity pattern in MDMR analysis in the discovered MPFC region. c),   F  -value map of the group by depressive RRS interaction effect on the connectivity pattern in MDMR analysis in the discovered PCC/Prec region.

From MDMR analysis, we used the significant regions as the seed of the following seed-based connectivity analysis. We note that while the seed search with MDMR was performed within the MPFC and PCC/Prec masks, connectivity from a seed was evaluated in the whole brain region. Therefore, the analysis covered the whole brain connectivity that originated from the MPFC and PCC/Prec seed regions. \n\nThe second step was a seed-based connectivity analysis for the discovered significant regions of the MDMR statistical map. The analysis was done for the original resolution functional images. The seed region (6mm-radius sphere) was placed at a peak location of significant clusters in the MDMR statistical map. The average signal time-course of the seed area was used as a reference signal to calculate correlations with other voxels in the whole brain. Fisher's   z  -transformation was applied to the correlation coefficient to make a connectivity map for each participant. Then, as a second-level group analysis, voxel-wise linear model analysis was applied to the connectivity maps with the same design matrix as the MDMR. The statistical map was thresholded with voxel-wise   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 and cluster-size correction of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05. The cluster-size threshold was evaluated with 3dClustSim in AFNI using a spatial autocorrelation function model ( ). \n\nLimiting the search area of MDMR helps increase the sensitivity of the analysis because the estimation of the null distribution derived from the permutation test used for family-wise error correction could be optimized for each region. This sensitivity improvement could be critical for the discovery because the sensitivity of MDMR analysis is lower than a seed-based analysis ( ). \n\n\n### Simulation of online functional connectivity neurofeedback signal \n  \nTo design an optimal neurofeedback signal for the identified FC associated with an RRS score, we performed a simulation to calculate an online real-time FC feedback signal. Here, two methods of online connectivity neurofeedback signal, sliding-window correlation ( ) and the two-point algorithm ( ), were evaluated. The sliding-window correlation is a   z  -transformed Pearson correlation between ROIs within a time window. Widths of a three- to ten-time points window were evaluated in the simulation. The window was moved at each TR to calculate the online feedback signal. The two-point algorithm uses the directionality of the signal change between the regions to evaluate their connectivity. The feedback signal is calculated as a binary value; e.g., when a participant is trained to increase the connectivity, positive feedback (+1) is given if the two regions have the same change direction (e.g., an increase or decrease); otherwise, no feedback (0) is given. The original introduction of the two-point method ( ) used a control ROI to cancel a signal change unspecific to the target connectivity. With the control ROI, positive feedback is given when the two target regions have the same change direction as well as that is different from the direction in the control region. Both versions of the two-point method, with and without the control ROI, were evaluated in the simulation. \n\nFeedback signals of these online functional connectivity measures were calculated in a real-time fMRI processing simulation for the resting-state fMRI data used in the connectome-wide analysis. The simulation was performed on an advanced real-time fMRI data processing system implementing comprehensive online noise reduction processes ( ;  ). The system performed slice-timing correction, motion correction, spatial smoothing, signal scaling, and GLM with regressors of high-pass filtering, six motion parameters, mean white matter signal, mean ventricle signal, and RETROICOR ( ) in real-time online processing. This system enabled us to obtain a cleaned online fMRI signal in real-time. The online FC was calculated for this online processed signal. \n\nThe optimality of online FC was evaluated with regard to three criteria, correlation with FC obtained from offline analysis, robustness to head motion, and timeliness of neurofeedback. Since the identified FC in the connectome-wide analysis had a significant association with rumination severity in the offline FC (correlation with whole time-course signals), an online FC that had a high correlation with the offline FC should be a better neurofeedback signal. Correlation between the offline FC and the average online FC neurofeedback signal time-course was calculated for this evaluation. Robustness to the head motion's artifact was evaluated with the correlation between the time-course of the online FC neurofeedback signal and the time-course of the mean frame-wise displacement within the window of online connectivity calculation. For the two-point method, the window was defined by the current and the previous time points. The timeliness of the online FC was determined by its dependence on the signal history. Dependence on history is large for methods with more time points; thus, a short-width sliding-window or the two-point method are preferred in this regard. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Connectome-wide association analysis \n  \n shows the demographic and symptom profile of the Tulsa 1000 participants used for this analysis. There was no significant difference in age between the groups. Symptom scales of rumination, depression, and anxiety were significantly higher for MA than HC. All the sub-scales of RRS were also significantly higher for MA than HC.   \nData demographic and symptom scales. \n  Table 1     \n\na shows the masks for the MPFC and PCC/Prec regions, where the MDMR analysis was performed. A significant association between a symptom scale and the FC was found for reflective RRS and depressive RRS in the MDMR analysis. Specifically, a significant   F   value of the MDMR analysis for the effect of reflective RRS was found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, x, y,   z  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22122, 30, 24\u00a0mm in MNI) in the MPFC ( b). A significant effect of the group by depressive RRS interaction was found in the left precuneus (\u22126, \u221254, 48\u00a0mm in MNI) in the PCC/Prec ( c). No other symptoms and their interaction with the group showed a significant effect on the connectivity pattern in the MDMR analysis. Post-hoc seed-based connectivity analysis was performed for the peak locations of the significant MDMR results. \n\nThe second step post-hoc analysis for the ACC seed connectivity revealed a significant effect of reflective RRS ( ) at the bilateral fusiform and inferior temporal area, the bilateral middle frontal region, the left middle cingulate region, the left medial frontal region, the right precuneus, the right temporal pole, the right thalamus, and the right calcarine region. Peak coordinates of the significant clusters are shown in  . The connectivity between the ACC and these regions was positively correlated with reflective RRS.   \nRegions with anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) connectivity significantly associated with reflective RRS. The map was thresholded with voxel-wise   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 and cluster-size corrected   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05. \n  Fig 2     \nPeak coordinates (MNI) of clusters with the significant effect of reflective RRS on the anterior cingulate cortex (x, y, z\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122, 30, 24\u00a0mm) functional connectivity. \n  Table 2   \n\nThe second step post-hoc analysis for the effect of depressive RRS on the precuneus connectivity was performed for each of the HC and MA groups to resolve the significant interaction effect on the precuneus connectivity. As the aim of this study was to identify the connectivity associated with pathological rumination, and the variance of RRS within HC was not large, we focused on the MA group here. A result of the HC group is shown in supplementary materials (supplementary figure 1 and table S1).   shows the regions with the precuneus connectivity significantly associated with depressive RRS for MA. The MA group had a significant association between depressive RRS and the precuneus connectivity at the right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ, x, y,   z  \u00a0=\u00a049, \u221249, 23\u00a0mm in MNI) area and the left intraparietal sulcus (LIPS, \u221237, \u221257, 53\u00a0mm) region. Connectivity between the precuneus and these regions was positively correlated with depressive RRS in MA.   \nRegions with precuneus connectivity significantly associated with depressive RRS in mood and anxiety disorder (MA) group. The maps were thresholded with voxel-wise   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 and cluster-size corrected   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05. \n  Fig 3   \n\nThese results indicated that pathological rumination in MA was associated with the precuneus connectivity with the right TPJ and the left IPS regions. We further examined the association with other RRS subscales as well as the effect of gender and medication status on these connectivities.   shows associations between the precuneus connectivity and RRS subscales for the RTPJ and the LIPS regions. Connectivity (  z  -transformed Pearson correlation) was calculated between the mean signals of a 6-mm-radius sphere ROI centered at the peak locations. The RTPJ connectivity with the precuneus had significant associations with all RRS subscales in the MA group. LIPS connectivity with the precuneus had a significant association only with depressive RRS in MA. No significant effect of gender was found on either connectivity when the interaction of gender by depressive RRS was added in the analysis. When the interaction of medication status by depressive RRS was added in the analysis, a significant interaction effect of medication by depressive RRS was observed for the RTPJ connectivity (  F  \u00a0=\u00a04.663,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.031). This effect was driven by the larger association in unmedicated (  t  \u00a0=\u00a04.189,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001) than medicated participants (  t  \u00a0=\u00a01.986,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.048). No significant interaction effect of the medication on depressive RRS was found for the LIPS connectivity (  F  \u00a0=\u00a00.382,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.537). Considering that all RRS subscales were significantly higher for MA than HC ( ), these results suggest that the precuneus connectivity with the RTPJ could be more strongly associated with the severity of rumination symptoms in MA disorder than with the LIPS.   \nAssociations between the precuneus connectivity and RRS subscales in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ, a) and the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS, b) regions for the healthy control (HC) and mood and anxiety disorder (MA) groups. Each point indicates an individual participant. Fitted lines and their 95% confidence intervals for HC and MA are also shown.   t   and   p   values indicate the significance of the linear association between RRS and connectivity for each group. \n  Fig 4   \n\nWe also examined the robustness of the post-hoc result with a split-data validation analysis. The analysis was performed for the MA group with the precuneus seed identified by the MDMR analysis. The MA participants were randomly divided into two sets (  N  \u00a0=\u00a0112 and 113), and the seed-based connectivity analysis was performed for each set independently with the same procedure as above. While the significant effect was seen only with a less stringent threshold (voxel-wise   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.005) in either set, RTPJ was the only cluster that was overlapped in both splits of the analysis (supplementary figure 2a). The overlapped region was included in the result of the original analysis. We also examined the robustness of the association between RRS and the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity. The significant RTPJ region in one split was used to evaluate the connectivity in samples from another split (supplementary figure 2b). When the RTPJ region for the first split was tested with the second split samples, the RRS association was significant (t[107]\u00a0=\u00a02.156,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.033), and when the RTPJ region for the second split was tested with the first split samples, the RRS association was close to significance (t[106]\u00a0=\u00a01.952,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.054). Although significance level decreased in a split data, the same trend of the association between the RRS and the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity was replicated in both splits. \n\n\n### Simulation of online functional connectivity neurofeedback signal \n  \nThe FC between the precuneus and the RTPJ was determined as a promising rtfMRI-nf target to relieve the rumination symptoms. We, therefore, performed a simulation analysis of online FC neurofeedback signal for this connectivity. Control ROI for the two-point method was placed at the right precentral region (6mm-radius sphere centered at x, y,   z  \u00a0=\u00a031, \u221229, 69\u00a0mm in MNI), where the correlation between motion and its connectivity with the precuneus was highest in the cortex. Thus, controlling the signal change in this ROI could remove the effect of motion on the FC neurofeedback signal. \n\na shows the correlations between the offline and online FCs with the two-point and sliding-window methods in a real-time fMRI processing simulation. Including the control point in the two-point method decreased the correlation, and the more time points the online calculation included, the higher the correlation with the offline measure was observed.  b shows the distribution of correlation between head motion and online connectivity measures across participants. The plot indicates that the more time points the online calculation included, the more participants had a high absolute correlation with motion.   \nThe results of the real-time fMRI processing simulation. a, Correlation between the offline and online connectivity measures for the two-point and sliding-window methods with different window width (w). b, Distributions of correlations between head motion and online connectivity measures across participants.

The connectome-wide association analysis revealed that the connectivity between the precuneus (\u22126, \u221254, 48\u00a0mm in MNI) and the RTPJ (49, \u221249, 23\u00a0mm in MNI) was significantly associated with depressive RRS as well as brooding and reflective RRS in MA, and this association was greater for unmedicated than medicated participants. The simulation analysis of the online FC neurofeedback signal for this connectivity indicated that while the methods with more time points had a high correlation with offline FC, these also had a high risk of contamination by motion. In addition, a method with more time points is also not favored in regard to the timeliness of feedback signal. \n\nWhile depressive and brooding components, rather than reflective component of RRS have been associated with the pathological effect of rumination ( ), the current data indicated that MA participants had significantly high reflective RRS as well as depressive and brooding RRS. High RRS in both reflective and brooding components was also observed in another study ( ). This observation was consistent with the study indicating that brooding and reflective rumination were not separate factors in depressed patients because these components could exacerbate each other in depression ( ). The significant effect of depressive RRS was found in the FC between the precuneus and RTPJ and between the precuneus and the left intraparietal sulcus (LIPS) region. The precuneus\u2013RTPJ FC was significantly associated with all components of RRS, while the precuneus\u2013LIPS FC was significantly associated only with depressive RRS. Considering that all components of RRS were significantly higher for MA than HC, and each component of RRS could exacerbate each other in a pathological state, the precuneus\u2013RTPJ functional connectivity constitutes a promising intervention target for FC-based rtfMRI-nf to treat pathological rumination. \n\nThe TPJ region, especially in the right hemisphere, has been implicated in attentional and social functions, including the theory of mind and self-other judgment ( ). Specifically, its anterior part is associated with externally-oriented, stimulus-driven attention with high connectivity to attentional selection regions, while its posterior part is associated with internally-oriented, stimulus-independent process with high connectivity to regions for social cognitions ( ;  ;  ). The RTPJ region in the present result was included in the posterior part of TPJ in either parcellation of anatomical connectivity of diffusion tensor imaging ( ), the task-related meta-analytic connectivity, or resting-state functional connectivity ( ). Meta-analysis studies also found that brain activations for social cognitive tasks overlapped with the DMN regions in the dorsomedial PFC, the precuneus, and the TPJ areas ( ;  ;  ). These regions coactivated in autobiographical memory and theory of mind tasks ( ). These suggest that high connectivity between the precuneus and RTPJ could be associated with thinking of autobiographical events in a social context that might be associated with exacerbation of negative judgment in rumination. Coactivation of the precuneus and the TPJ was also reported for the contrast between other- and self-agency conditions, with higher activation at the other-agency condition ( ;  ). Hence, critical thinking of autobiographical things with others\u2019 viewpoints, which could amplify rumination severity, might be associated with a high precuneus\u2013RTPJ connectivity. \n\nThis connectivity, however, has not been identified in studies investigating FCs associated with self-referential processing and rumination symptoms. Actually, several studies suggest that MPFC was involved in self-referential processing and rumination. The MPFC implication in self-referential thinking has been indicated in a direct examination of a self-referential thinking task, which showed that MPFC activity was high in self-referential thinking relative to a general thinking condition ( ). Interestingly, while RRS was positively correlated with this activity in healthy participants, it was negatively correlated with RRS in remitted MDD participants. This decreased MPFC activity associated with high RRS in participants with a high risk of MDD suggests that the self-recognition process decreased in the ruminative state. If the present result of increased precuneus\u2013RTPJ connectivity is linked to thinking with others\u2019 viewpoints ( ;  ), the decrease of MPFC activity associated with a decreased self-recognition process might be consistent with the current result. Thus, the precuneus-RTPJ FC might not be implicated in the self-referential processing itself but could be related to the process of exacerbating and maintaining pathological rumination through thinking autobiographical events with critical others\u2019 perspective. \n\nAlterations in FC associated with rumination have also been indicated for MPFC seed connectivity. Increased resting-state FC between the MPFC seed and the PCC was correlated with reflective rumination for female participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) ( ). This result is partly consistent with the present result that found the association between reflective RRS and the MPFC connectivity ( ,  ). Resting-state FC between the dorsal MPFC seed and the temporal pole was positively correlated with depressive rumination for first-episode treatment-na\u00efve young adults with MDD ( ). Resting-state FC between the MPFC seed and the left inferior parietal lobule was also positively correlated with the severity of negative self-focused thought ( ). Positive correlation with negative self-focused thought was also seen for pregenual ACC seed connectivity with the dorsolateral PFC, the precuneus, the inferior parietal cortex, and the paracentral lobule extending to SMA ( ). Resting-state FC for the subgenual ACC with the right middle and inferior frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with RRS ( ). These results suggest that MPFC is implicated in self-referential processing and the rumination process, while the associated FC was not consistent. \n\nWe should note that the results of these FC association with rumination studies cannot be compared to the current result because those used a priori defined seed ROI, and the analysis for the RRS association was performed post hoc for the FC with a significant difference between the depressed and healthy groups. Thus, even though the current effect has not been found in those studies, they do not contradict the current result. Also, while the present analysis did not find associations between depressive rumination and FC in the MPFC, this could be explained by the low sensitivity of MDMR analysis relative to a seed-based connectivity analysis ( ). Since the MDMR analysis could find a significant association only with a large effect, the found association between the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity and the RRS should be considered a robust result. In addition, the aim of this analysis was to discover the rtfMRI-nf intervention target, not to describe the connectivity affected by the rumination comprehensively. Thus, finding the FC with a robust association with rumination should be suitable for the present purpose. \n\nAdditionally, we performed simulation analysis to find the optimal online functional connectivity neurofeedback signal for the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity. The real-time fMRI processing simulation indicated a trade-off between the correlation with offline FC and the risk of motion contamination. The higher correlation with the offline FC for the methods with more time points was not surprising because the offline FC includes all time points for its calculation. The higher correlation with motion was because the methods with more time points had prolonged dependence on signal history, which could spread the effect of a time point with a significant head motion to many points of the neurofeedback signal. Dependence of long signal history is also unfavored regarding the timeliness of the feedback signal. Because a motion artifact could be critical as a risk of implicit learning of artifact effect in rtfMRI-nf training ( ), and the online rtfMRI-nf signal should minimize the delay as the fMRI signal already includes the hemodynamic response delay, a feedback signal with fewer time points should be preferred. While the correlation with offline FC was lower for the methods with fewer time points, the observed correlation, higher than 0.5 ( a), could be high enough to train the participants to regulate the target connectivity. As a matter of fact, many rtfMRI-nf studies demonstrated successful self-regulation training even without a comprehensive real-time noise reduction process ( ), and the correlation between the online- and offline-calculated signals was not high when the real-time noise reduction process was not comparable to the offline one ( ). When we performed a simulation with only the motion correction in real-time processing \u2013 which is a conventional rtfMRI process used in many studies \u2013 the correlation between the online and offline FC was less than 0.5 even for the highest online FC neurofeedback signal (10-TR sliding-window). This indicates that an online neurofeedback signal with a correlation as high as 0.5 with offline-evaluated FC could be enough to train a participant to regulate the target brain activity. Taken together, we consider the two-point method or a sliding-window correlation with short window width as favored to an online FC neurofeedback signal. \n\nFor the two-point method, using the control ROI did not help to reduce the motion effect compared to the two-point method without the control ROI ( b). This result could be attributed to the fact that the current real-time fMRI processing simulation included a comprehensive noise reduction process; thus, the additional benefit of controlling motion was minimal. The control region is employed to ensure the specificity of the feedback signal to the target connectivity. While we picked a control region whose connectivity with the precuneus was correlated with motion, other kinds of unspecific effects on the connectivity, such as breathing, should also be controlled ( ). A single control ROI, therefore, is not enough to reduce all unspecific effects. However, employing multiple control regions in the two-point method complicates the calculation as well as the meaning of the feedback signal. Indeed, in the simulation, using the control ROI decreased the correlation with offline FC evaluation for the target, which was due to a reduced positive feedback frequency with restriction by the control ROI. This suggests that noise reduction in preprocessing is preferred to using a control ROI. The current real-time fMRI processing used in the simulation included not only regressors of motion but also cardiac and respiration noise (RETROICOR), the mean white matter signal, and the mean ventricle signal. This comprehensive process could help to reduce unspecific effects on the connectivity and reduce the necessity of using a control ROI in the two-point method. \n\nThe connectome-wide investigation indicated that the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity was positively correlated with rumination severity. Hence, the rtfMRI-nf training to treat rumination symptoms should train a participant to decrease this connectivity. At the rtfMRI-nf training to decrease FC, the two-point method is more convenient than the sliding-window correlation because the sliding-window correlation requires a baseline level of connectivity to present feedback for signal reduction. Defining baseline connectivity is not a trivial task, though - it will need a personalized approach. In contrast, the two-point method does not need a baseline setting because the feedback signal is a binary value. We can give positive feedback when the two regions have different change directions, and give no feedback when they are the same. In light of these considerations, we suggest that the two-point method without control ROI is the most convenient, robust to motion, and timely online FC neurofeedback method to train a participant to decrease FC as far as we use the comprehensive real-time fMRI noise reduction process. \n\nSeveral limitations of this study should be acknowledged. Although the association between RRS and the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity was seen specifically for the MA group, this specificity could be due to the unbalanced number of participants. The present result might be biased to the MA population, and may not be generalized to rumination for the preclinical population. With the limitation of the sensitivity of MDMR, the analysis could detect only the association with a large effect. MDMR analysis is insensitive to a change in a small region because the analysis depends on the between-subject distance matrix, which summarizes the difference between a whole-brain connectivity maps into one distance measure ( ,  ). Permutation test used in the analysis also limits the sensitivity ( ). As the bias-variance trade-off in model complexity suggested ( ), null distribution in the permutation test could have large variance with a large multivariate model fitted to a limited number of samples, which makes it hard to find a significant effect. Therefore, the absence of a significant effect in other symptoms does not prove the absence of their effect on resting-state FC. Limiting the MDMR search within the MPFC and PCC/Prec areas could also limit the findings. While limiting the search region has methodological merit in increasing the analysis sensitivity, and these areas are the most credible regions for searching for association with rumination, there might be FCs that do not stem from these areas but have a strong association with rumination symptoms. Nevertheless, the identified association between RRS and the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity was significant, and this connectivity is a promising target of rtfMRI-nf that can possibly treat rumination symptoms. We should remember that the present result did not describe a comprehensive abnormality of resting-state FC associated with rumination but rather discovered the credible target of rtfMRI-nf intervention to treat rumination symptoms. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe data-driven process-based approach discovered the functional connectivity locus in the precuneus associated with rumination severity. We showed that the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity is a promising target of rtfMRI-nf intervention to treat rumination symptoms. The simulation analysis of the online FC neurofeedback signal suggested that the two-point method without control ROI was robust to motion, less dependent on the signal history, and convenient for the training to decrease FC. In future studies, we will examine the utility of rtfMRI-nf training to reduce the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity with the two-point method for alleviating pathological rumination. \n\nThe present study offers a discovery framework for the precise location of functional connectivity targets for rtfMRI-nf intervention. This framework could identify the target with high spatial specificity and is applicable to a wide range of symptom dimensions. In the future, the current approach could help rtfMRI-nf become fully-fledged as a clinical treatment, with a direct application of the neuroimaging result to clinical interventions focused on improving psychiatric symptoms and modifying the trajectory of psychiatric disorders. \n\n\n## Credit author statement \n  \nM.M., J.B. developed the analysis framework; M.P., J.B. and Tulsa 1000 (T1000) investigators designed the T1000 study and collected data, M.M., J.B. developed data acquisition and analysis infrastructure.

A psychological definition states that adaptive social behaviors are \u201cself-performing\u201d and \u201ccontain a solution.\u201d The present study investigated the neural correlates of adaptive social responses to frustrating situations by assessing the dimension of causal attribution. Based on attribution theory, internal causality refers to one\u2019s aptitudes that cause natural responses in real-life situations, whereas external causality refers to environmental factors, such as experimental conditions, causing such responses. To investigate the issue, we developed a novel approach that assesses causal attribution under experimental conditions. During fMRI scanning, subjects were required to engage in virtual frustrating situations and play the role of protagonists by verbalizing social responses, which were socially adaptive or non-adaptive. After fMRI scanning, the subjects reported their causal attribution index of the psychological reaction to the experimental condition. We performed a correlation analysis between the causal attribution index and brain activity. We hypothesized that the brain region whose activation would have a positive and negative correlation with the self-reported index of the causal attributions would be regarded as neural correlates of internal and external causal attribution of social responses, respectively. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe found a significant negative correlation between external causal attribution and neural responses in the right anterior temporal lobe for adaptive social behaviors. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis region is involved in the integration of emotional and social information. These results suggest that, particularly in adaptive social behavior, the social demands of frustrating situations, which involve external causality, may be integrated by a neural response in the right anterior temporal lobe. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nWe often encounter frustrating situations in our social lives. The following situation is an example: You are inputting data into your computer. Suddenly, the screen goes black, and soon after, your colleague holds up a plug and says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I accidently unplugged your PC\u201d (Figure  a, b). Rosenzweig created a model for the verbal responses to such frustrating situations, which was implemented in a widely used questionnaire, the \u201cPicture-Frustration Study\u201d (PF Study) [ , ]. In Rosenzweig\u2019s model, verbal responses to the frustrating situation are classified by two factors: the direction and type of aggression [ , ]. The direction of aggression involves requests towards self, another person, and nothing, and the types of aggression include attention to the frustrating event itself, to a cause of the frustrating situation, and to a solution to the frustrating situation. \n\nSocial adaptation is a crucial aspect of such social responses. Also in Rosenzweig\u2019s model, social adaptation of verbal responses is assessed by the Group Conformity Rating (GCR), which represents the degree to which these responses conform to common sense. However, the definition of social adaptation in this model was quite ambiguous, because \u201ccommon sense\u201d may differ across cultures. One clear definition of adaptation, drawn from coping theory [ , ], is the process used to manage environmental demands and to solve the problem that caused the frustrating situation without putting a burden on the environment. Corresponding to this definition [ , ], an adaptive response in Rosenzweig\u2019s model is one with a request to self (self-performing) that contains a solution [ ]. In the above-mentioned example of a frustrating situation, verbal responses such as \u201cYou need to re-input the data\u201d (other-performing) or \u201cI should have saved the data\u201d (no solution) are non-adaptive because they do not manage the environmental demand to finish the data input (containing a solution), nor do they avoid putting a burden on the environment (self-performing). In this case, a verbal response such as \u201cI will input the data again\u201d is an adaptive social response because it suggests self-performing behavior (i.e., action by one\u2019s self) and manages the environmental demands with a solution (i.e., to input the data again). \n\nCausal attribution is another key dimension of adaptive social responses. Attribution theory suggests that causal attribution in social behavior has an external\u2013internal dimension [ ]. Internal causality identifies one\u2019s aptitude as causing natural responses, whereas external causality identifies environmental factors as causing less natural responses [ ]. Here, we hypothesized that natural and less natural responses were related to internal and external causal attributions, respectively. Assessment of the external\u2013internal dimension of the causal attributions in adaptive social responses is important in areas of clinical psychology such as motivational interviewing [ ], where the goal is to change clients\u2019 behavior [ , ]. This technique has been used alter smoking behavior [ ], alcohol consumption [ ], and drug addiction [ ], as well as to promote diet/exercise therapy for patients with obesity [ ] and/or diabetes [ ]. The goal of a motivational interview with such clients is to evoke an internal causal attribution to change counterproductive to adaptive behavior [ ]. Thus, an objective assessment tool for the external\u2013internal dimension of the causal attribution underlying adaptive social responses would be useful in the clinical setting. Recent development of a visual cortex decoding device using neuroimaging techniques, [ ] indicates that neuroimaging studies have the potential to provide objective assessment tools for the clinical setting. \n\nAlthough the dimension of causal attribution is a critical aspect of social adaptation, the neural correlates of causal attributions in adaptive social responses are not well understood. Several neuroimaging studies have investigated social adaptation in terms of moral cognition and social norms (for review, see [ , ]). In paticular, Moll et al. [ ] reported that neural activity in the fronto\u2013temporal areas was involved in moral judgment and moral sensitivity [ ]. Berthoz et al. [ ] demonstrated that the medial frontal and anterior temporal regions were activated during transgression of a social norm. In terms of causal attributions, Spitzer et al. [ ] investigated the neural correlates of social norm compliance induced by punishment by others, which is thought to be associated with external causal attributions, and suggested that the bilateral orbitofrontal cortices and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were involved in compliance with social norms [ ]. Recent fMRI studies have focused on the neural correlates of causal attributions made in social situations. Blackwood et al. [ ] reported pre-motor cortex and cerebellar involvement in internal causal attributions, and Seidel et al. [ ] showed that, compared with external attribution, internal causal attribution induced activation in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and external attribution induced activation in the left TPJ and precuneus. Previous neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of either social adaptation or causal attribution in social situations; however, no studies have examined causal attribution in relation to social adaptation. \n\nThe present study aimed to identify the neural correlates underlying adaptive social responses to a frustrating situation by assessing causal attributions. To this end, we created an \u201cacting task\u201d that applied frustrating situations to Rosenzweig\u2019s model. We also used a parametric index of the self-reported social behavior causal attributions that was based on the work of Blackwood et al. and Seidel et al. [ , ]. We refer to this index as a \u201ccausality score,\u201d and applied it to the acting task to assess causal attributions related to the social responses exhibited under the experimental conditions. During the acting task, each subject was presented with a virtual frustrating situation and was asked to play the role of the protagonist by verbalizing social responses (Figure\u2009 ) that were either socially adaptive or non-adaptive (Table\u2009 , Figure\u2009 ) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Following fMRI scans, subjects were asked to evaluate their own causality scores, which indicated the likelihood that they would have responded to the social situation in the same way as the protagonist in the virtual frustrating situation (i.e., internal causal attribution). The causality score was used as an index of the internal causal attribution of the described social response. We assumed that causality scores would differ across trials during the acting task. We hypothesized that the brain region whose activation would have a positive and negative correlation with the self-reported index of the causal attributions would be regarded as neural correlates of internal and external causal attribution of social responses, respectively. In other words, the brain region whose neural activity during verbalization of a more natural response (i.e., internal causality) would be associated with higher causality scores than those during verbalization of a less natural social response (i.e., external causality). \n  \n Example of a frustrating situation (a stimulus sequence).   (  a  ) Background explanation of the picture stimulus. (  b  ) An example of the picture stimulus representing a frustrating situation. (  c  ) An example of a verbal response as an adaptive social behavior. \n    \nExamples of social responses \n    \n Example of a stimulus set.   (  a  ) The SW response describes the subject\u2019s own behavior in the near future. (  b  ) The SWo response describes the subject\u2019s own behavior in the past. (  c  ) The OW response describes another\u2019s behavior in the near future. (  d  ) The OWo response describes another\u2019s behavior in the past. (  e  ) The Co (control) condition only describes the situation. \n  \nFor behavioral results, we predicted that the causality scores of the adaptive social responses would correlate significantly with the results of the psychological questionnaire scales associated with character and aggressive behavior because responses to frustrating situations are affected by individual levels of social cooperation and correspond to features of aggressive behavior [ ]. In particular, we predicted that the causality scores for adaptive verbal responses would correlate with the cooperativeness (C) subscale of the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) [ ] and the anger control subscale of the State\u2013Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) [ ], which evaluates socially cooperative characteristics and self-control over angry behavior, respectively. \n\nWe predicted that the fMRI results would show involvement of the premotor cortex, cerebellum, and right TPJ in natural social responses because these areas play a role in internal causal attribution in social situations [ , ]. We expected the left TPJ and precuneus to be associated with less natural social responses because activity in these regions is associated with external causal attribution [ , ]. Furthermore, the processing underpinning social adaptation involves a wide variety of brain regions, including the medial and lateral prefrontal cortices, anterior and posterior superior temporal sulcus, and TPJ [ , ]. Thus, we predicted that the right and left TPJ would be involved in the internal and external causal attributions made about adaptive social responses to frustrating situations, respectively. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nIn total, 40 healthy volunteers (eight females, 32 males; mean age 20.5\u2009years,   SD   = 2.4, range, 18\u201328) participated. All participants were native Japanese speakers recruited from the Tohoku University community and all were right-handed, as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ ]. No subject had a history of neurological, psychiatric, or major medical disorders. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [ ]. The current study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tohoku University. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nEach real-life frustrating situation was presented in text form and was followed by presentation a picture taken from the first-person perspective of the participant (Figure\u2009 a, b). Each picture contained a message to the protagonist from the person responsible for the frustrating situation. The participant\u2019s verbal response to the frustrating situation (expressed either to the person responsible for the situation or to one\u2019s self) was then presented as a sentence on the picture (Figure\u2009 c). This sequence was referred to as \u201ca stimulus sequence\u201d (Figure\u2009 ). The individual whose photograph appears in the example provided written informed consent for publication of his photograph. \n\nTo test the specificity of a significant correlation in adaptive social behaviors, it is necessary to compare adaptive and non-adaptive verbal responses. We referred to stimulus sequences with both adaptive and non-adaptive responses to the same frustrating situation as \u201ca stimulus set\u201d (Figure\u2009 ). To prepare the stimulus sets for our acting task, preliminary experiments were conducted in three steps: (1) collection of stimulus sequences including frustrating situations and verbal responses in daily life; (2) categorization of adaptive and non-adaptive responses, which constituted a stimulus set; and (3) verification of the stimulus sets. \n\nIn the first step, to elicit honest verbal responses to daily frustrating situations, a separate group of subjects from the Tohoku University community, the same community from which participants in the present study were selected, anonymously completed our original questionnaire asking about daily frustrating situations in their lives as college students and possible verbal responses they would give in such situations. As a result, we identified 41 frustrating situations and seven or eight verbal responses for each situation (a total of 306 verbal responses). Then we obtained 41 pictures, either from the internet or by taking the pictures ourselves, which illustrated 41 frustrating situations. \n\nSeventeen healthy subjects (three women, 14 men; 19\u201325\u2009years old) were tested separately in the second step. Each subject looked at every stimulus sequence. They were then asked to \u201cimagine being the protagonist in each frustrating situation and evaluate how naturally they would utter a prepared response.\u201d The evaluation of each verbal response was used as a reference for the \u201ccausality\u201d scores. To categorize the different types of verbal responses, we performed a discriminant analysis using the SPSS software (ver. 15.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The causality scores were used as independent variables in the discriminant analysis because the effect of the different verbal responses on the causality scores differed among individuals. \n\nAdditionally, we wanted to use an experimental approach to demonstrate that the two factors of adaptation (i.e., \u201cself-performing\u201d and \u201ccontaining a solution\u201d) were significant explanations for the verbal responses to the frustrating situations. Based on this analysis, verbal responses were divided into four categories by two discriminant functions that accounted for 95.3% of the variance. \n\nThe functions were two types of verbal responses to the frustrating situation; these were referred to as performer (self/other-performing) and solution (with/without solution), corresponding to the direction and type of aggression in the Rosenzweig model, respectively [ ]. We categorized these two factors into four types of verbal responses (Table\u2009 ): self-performing/with solution (SW), self-performing/without solution (SWo), other-performing/with solution (OW), and other-performing/without solution (OWo). In this context, the SW response satisfied the definition of adaptation as a process used to manage environmental demands [ , ] because the SW response does not suggest that a burden will be placed on the environment. As a result of dividing the verbal responses into four categories, the stimulus set contained each frustrating situation, four verbal responses for the conditions of interest (SW, SWo, OW, and OWo; Table\u2009 ), and one response as a control condition (Co; Figure\u2009 ). Under the Co condition, each subject read the description of the situation itself instead of the verbal responses. \n\nIn the third step, a preliminary psychological test conducted with 10 different healthy subjects (five women, five men, 19\u201329\u2009years old) was used to verify the stimulus set. We eliminated responses understood by fewer than 90% of the subjects. Accordingly, 16 stimulus sets including four types of verbal responses met this criterion (see, Additional file  , Appendix). The means and standard deviations of the length of the verbal responses were 11.9 \u00b1 1.4, 13.1 \u00b1 1.8, 12.4 \u00b1 1.7, 13.0 \u00b1 2.2, and 13.1 \u00b1 1.4 moras (a prosodic unit of the Japanese language) under the SW, SWo, OW, OWo, and Co conditions, respectively. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant difference in the average length of the responses across conditions [  F  (4,75) = 1.68]. Accordingly, we assumed that behavioral outputs, such as the speech and eye movements required for reading the verbal responses, were similar across conditions. \n\n\n### Task \n  \nPrior to the fMRI experiment, subjects practiced the acting task outside the scanner with four stimulus sets not used in the experiment. The subjects then viewed all the stimulus sequences without verbal responses to ensure that they could understand the frustrating situations. \n\nDuring the fMRI experiment, each subject performed the acting task. Subjects acted as protagonists (i.e., as if they had been in the situation presented in the stimulus picture) by reading a verbal response with feeling. By fixing the headphones between the head coil and the temple areas, head motions were dissociated from jaw movements during reading. To record the entirety of the response, subjects were asked to press a button with their right index fingers while reading the verbal response aloud. A mixed design was applied to this fMRI experiment. To allow a parametric modulation analysis for each trial [ ], the inter-trial intervals varied from 0 to 3.5\u2009s, as in an event-related model. Because our primary objective was to have subjects act out the task, we used a block design to decrease the load involved in switching among different types of verbal responses. In brief, four trials using the same type of verbal responses were arranged in a block design. The details of the task procedure are shown in Figure\u2009 . \n  \n Task procedure.   (  a  ) At the start of each block, a text cue indicating which type of verbal response was to be adopted was presented for 3\u2009s. (  b  ) In each trial, a general explanation was presented for 2\u2009s. (  c  ) The picture stimulus was then shown for 2\u2009s, and (  d  ) the verbal response was elicited for 4\u2009s. The subjects were asked to read the verbal response soon after it appeared and to press a button with their right index finger while reading. (  e  ) The intertrial interval (ITI) varied from 0 to 3.5\u2009s. (  f  ) Four trials with the same types of verbal responses were presented in one block. The duration of each block was 43.5\u2009s. The interval between blocks was 6.5\u2009s, during which time a central fixation cross (+) was presented to signal the resting condition. Eighty stimuli (16 stimulus sets, 20 blocks) were presented while subjects underwent fMRI scanning; the order of stimuli and blocks were counterbalanced among subjects. The entire scanning time was 17\u2009min, 20\u2009s. \n  \n\n### Causality scores \n  \nAfter fMRI scanning, the subjects were presented with all of the verbal responses to the frustrating situations outside the scanner. The subjects were not informed of this task prior to scanning. They were asked to evaluate the similarity between the verbal responses given in the scanner and their natural responses to real-life situations using a nine-point scale (1: not at all natural and 9: very natural); these were referred to as causality scores. Subjects were asked to evaluate causality after the fMRI task because an evaluation during scanning may have interfered with their ability to fully immerse themselves in role playing. The causality score was defined as an index of the internal causal attribution of the described response to the hypothetical scenario. Consistent with this definition, when verbalizing a more natural response (i.e., internal causality), the subjects\u2019 causality scores would be higher than when verbalizing a less natural response (i.e., reflecting external causality). \n\n\n### Psychological measurements \n  \nAll subjects completed the Japanese version of the STAXI [ ] and the Japanese version of the TCI [ ]. The STAXI assesses the intensity of feelings of anger (state anger), the disposition to experience anger (trait anger), behaviorally expressed anger (anger-out), suppressed anger (anger-in), and self-control of anger behaviors (anger-control) [ ]. The TCI has four independent temperament dimensions (novelty-seeking, harm-avoidance, reward-dependence, and persistence) and three independent character dimensions (self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence) [ ]. Self-directedness refers to the ability to control one\u2019s own behavior to achieve one\u2019s own goals. Cooperativeness refers to acceptance of others, which induces socially adaptive behaviors such as social tolerance, helpfulness, and compassion. Self-transcendence is related to a kind of spirituality associated with the notion that everything is an essential and consequential part of the universe [ , ]. \n\n\n### fMRI measurement \n  \nTransaxial gradient-echo images (number of slices = 44, echo time = 50\u2009ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, slice thickness = 2.2\u2009mm, slice gap = 0.7\u2009mm, FOV = 192\u2009mm, and matrix = 64 \u00d7 64) covering the whole cerebrum were acquired at a repetition time of 4000\u2009ms using an echo planar sequence and a Siemens Symphony (1.5\u2009T; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) MR scanner. To allow for T1 equilibration effects, eight dummy scans were acquired and subsequently discarded. Additionally, anatomical T1-weighted images (thickness, 1\u2009mm; FOV, 256\u2009mm; data matrix, 192 \u00d7 224; TR = 1900\u2009ms; TE = 3.93\u2009ms) were acquired from all participants. \n\n\n### Imaging data analysis \n  \nThe following preprocessing procedures were performed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM2) software (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) and MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA): correction for head motion, adjustment of acquisition-timing across slices, coregistration to the anatomical image, spatial normalization using the anatomical image and the MNI template, and smoothing using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 10\u2009mm. Data from eight subjects (one woman, seven men) with excessive head motion (more than 2\u2009mm) were excluded. Thus, data from 32 subjects were analyzed. \n\nA conventional two-level approach for fMRI data was adopted using SPM2. We designed two models of expected signal changes for each of the four types of verbal response conditions: canonical signal changes among trials (c: canonical model) and parametrically modulated signal changes correlated with the causality scores within each trial (p: parametric modulation model). The causality scores were normalized to a mean of zero under each condition to orthogonalize the four conditions. Under the Co condition, we designed only a canonical model. A voxel-by-voxel multiple regression analysis of the expected signal changes for each of the nine models (SW-c, SW-p, SWo-c, SWo-p, OW-c, OW-p, OWo-c, OWo-p, and Co) was then applied to the preprocessed images for each subject. The expected signal changes were constructed using the hemodynamic response function provided by SPM2. Parameter estimates from the parametric modulation analysis appeared as the degree of correlation between the causality scores and the signal changes. Statistical inference about the contrast of parameter estimates was performed with the second-level between-subjects (random effect) model using one-sample   t  -tests. The height threshold of all voxel-by-voxel analyses was set at   p   < 0.001, uncorrected, and the extent threshold was set at   p   < 0.05 for multiple comparisons [ , ]. \n\nFirst, to identify the neural networks involved in acting out the virtual frustrating situations, we tested the contrast of the parameter estimates of the canonical model under each of the four conditions compared with the Co condition. The neural responses associated with the adaptive social response were identified by testing the contrast of SW versus each of the other three conditions. Second, to identify the neural responses related to natural and less natural social responses to the SW conditions, we used an event-related model to allow for a parametric modulation analysis of each trial [ ] and tested for positive and negative correlations. To exclude the possibility of detecting deactivation correlated with the causality score, we restricted the analyses to the areas in which activation was significant under the SW conditions versus the Co condition (i.e., a mask; p < 0.05, uncorrected). Finally, to examine the specificity of the SW conditions, we performed a paired   t  -test between the SW condition and the three other conditions using parameter estimates of the peak activations of the cluster derived from the parametric modulation analysis. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nThe means and standard deviations of the durations recorded for the button press while acting out each condition were 2.16 \u00b1 0.25, 2.27 \u00b1 0.25, 2.20 \u00b1 0.26, 2.29 \u00b1 0.24, and 2.31 \u00b1 0.23\u2009s under the SW, SWo, OW, OWo, and Co conditions, respectively (Table\u2009 ). No significant difference in duration was observed among the five conditions [one-way ANOVA;   F  (4,155) = 2.10], suggesting that the behavioral output required for reading the verbal responses was controlled across conditions. \n  \nBehavioral data \n  \nThe duration of the acting task is shown for each condition. No significant difference in duration was observed among the five conditions [one-way ANOVA;   F  (4,155) = 2.10]. Causality scores under the four coping conditions are shown. A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of solution [  F  (1, 31) = 50.47,   p   < 0.05] and a significant interaction [  F  (1, 31) = 12.98,   p   < 0.05].   Post-hoc   paired t-tests revealed that causality scores under the OWo condition were significantly higher than those under the SW [t(31) = -2.81, p < 0.05, Bonferroni correction] and the OW conditions [t(31) = -8.11, p < 0.0001, Bonferroni correction]. Causality scores under the SWo condition were significantly higher than those under the OW condition [t(31) = 5.39, p < 0.0001, Bonferroni correction]. The values are shown as means and standard deviations. SW, self-performing/with solution; SWo, self-performing/without solution; OW, other-performing/with solution; OWo, other-performing/without solution; Co, control condition. \n  \nThe mean values of the causality scores for each condition were 5.25 \u00b1 1.19, 5.82 \u00b1 0.96, 4.72 \u00b1 1.06, and 6.26 \u00b1 1.30 under the SW, SWo, OW, and OWo conditions, respectively. The two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of solution [  F  (1,31) = 50.47,   p   < 0.05] and a significant interaction [  F  (1,31) = 12.98,   p   < 0.05] (Table\u2009 ).   Post hoc   paired   t  -tests revealed that the causality scores under the OWo condition were significantly higher than were those under the SW [  t  (31) = -2.81,   p   < 0.05, Bonferroni correction] and the OW [  t  (31) = -8.11,   p   < 0.0001, Bonferroni correction] conditions, and that those under the SWo condition were significantly higher than were those under the OW condition [  t  (31) = 5.39,   p   < 0.0001, Bonferroni correction]. \n\nThe correlation analysis between the causality scores in each condition and the psychological questionnaire scales revealed a significant positive correlation between the average causality score in the SW conditions and the Anger Control subscale of the STAXI (  r   = 0.43,   p   = 0.014), as expected. Although we did not find a significant positive correlation between the causality scores in the SW conditions and the C subscale of the TCI (  r   = 0.29,   p   = 0.10), the analysis showed the positive tendency we expected. Furthermore, the causality scores in the SWo conditions had a significant positive correlation with the C subscale of the TCI (  r   = 0.37,   p   = 0.037), whereas the causality scores in the OWo conditions were negatively correlated with the C subscale of the TCI (  r   = -0.41,   p   = 0.020). \n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \n#### Neural correlates of social responses to frustrating situations \n  \nThe brain regions significantly activated in each of the four conditions, relative to the Co condition, are shown in Table\u2009  and Figure\u2009 . Statistically significant activation under all conditions relative to the Co condition was observed in the medial prefrontal cortices, the left inferior frontal gyrus, the bilateral temporal lobes, and the bilateral occipital lobes. The OW coping style, but not the other conditions, was associated with significant activation of the dorsal part of the medial prefrontal cortices, the supplementary motor area, the right inferior frontal gyrus, and the parietal lobe. Statistically significant activation in all conditions, with the exception of the SWo coping style, was observed in the bilateral temporoparietal junctions, the orbito-insular junction, the bilateral hippocampus/parahippocampus, and the cerebellum. We found no significant differential activation between the SW and the other three conditions. \n  \n Neural correlates of social responses in frustrating situations.   High levels of brain activity estimated from a conventional subtraction analysis of the (  a  ) SW, (  b  ) SWo, (  c  ) OW, and (  d  ) OWo conditions relative to the Co condition are overlaid on a SPM2 rendered brain. The panels show the right sagittal, anterior, left sagittal, and ventral views of the brain. The statistical threshold was set at   p   < 0.001 and corrected to   p   < 0.05 for multiple comparisons using cluster size. \n    \nNeural correlates of social responses to frustrating situations \n  \nMNI coordinates (  x  ,   y  ,   z  ) of peak activation,   t  -value at the peak, and cluster size (mm ) in parenthesis are given for each area activated by each coping style, relative to the Co condition. The height threshold for significant activation was set at   p   < 0.001. Correction for multiple comparisons (  p   < 0.05 in cluster size) was made. L: left, R: right, M: medial. The lowercase letter given with the cluster size indicates that the peak is in the same activated cluster as are the other peaks with the same letter. (*) The region includes the activated cluster with no peak activation. \n  \n\n\n### Neural correlates of natural adaptive social responses to frustrating situations \n  \nThe parametric modulation analysis showed no significant positive correlations between the causality scores and neural responses in any condition. \n\n\n### Neural correlates of less natural adaptive social responses to frustrating situations \n  \nThe parametric modulation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation only between the SW condition causality scores and neural responses in the right anterior temporal lobe (Table\u2009 , Figure\u2009 a). The parameter estimates showed significant differences between the SW condition and the other three conditions at the peak voxel in this cluster (Table\u2009 , Figure\u2009 b). The time-series data for the percentage signal change at the peak statistical value in this area showed larger responses for the low-causality scores compared with the medium- and high-causality scores (Figure\u2009 c). \n  \nNeural correlates of less natural adaptive social responses to frustrating situations \n  \nThe results of the significant negative correlation between the agreement scores and neural responses for the SW verbal responses masked by the SW\u2013Co contrast inclusively. The coordinates,   t  -value of peak activation, and cluster size are shown for each activated area. The height threshold for significant activation was set at   p   < 0.001, and corrected to   p   < 0.05 for multiple comparisons using cluster size. \n    \n Neural correlates of less natural adaptive social responses.   (  a  ) The right anterior temporal lobe was activated only under the SW condition, as shown on the rendered brain presentation of the SPM2 from the right sagittal view. No significant correlation was found between neural activation and the causality score under the SWo, OW, or OWo conditions. The statistical threshold was set at   p   < 0.001 and corrected to   p   < 0.05 for multiple comparisons using cluster size. (  b  ) The graphs show activation profiles (parameter estimates from a parametric modulation analysis and standard errors of the mean at peak activation). *  p   < 0.05, paired   t  -test. (  c  ) The average percent signal changes over time are shown for trials with low (1\u20133; red triangles), medium (4\u20136; green squares), and high (7\u20139; blue diamonds) causality scores under the SW condition. Vertical axes represent percent signal changes; horizontal axes indicate peristimulus time (s). \n    \nParameter estimates at the anterior temporal lobe [40 20 -32] \n  \nA significant difference was observed among the four conditions [one-way ANOVA;   F  (3,124) = 2.81,   p   = 0.41]. Significant differences between SW and the other three conditions were detected using a paired   t  -test (  t  (31) = \u20132.68,   p   = 0.012;   t  (31) = \u20133.62,   p   = 0.001;   t  (31) = \u20132.51,   p   = 0.017, respectively. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of the present study was to identify the neural correlates of adaptive social responses to frustrating situations by assessing causal attributions. We found a significant negative correlation between causality scores and brain activity in the right anterior temporal lobe while acting out adaptive social responses. The negative correlation indicated a less natural social response, suggesting that this region is specifically activated when an adaptive social response is driven by an external causal attribution. \n\n### Rosenzweig model and social adaptation \n  \nWe revealed the neural correlates of the specificity of social adaptation based on the Rosenzweig model. In the current experiment, we combined the Rosenzweig model for social responses to frustrating situations [ , ] and social adaptation, proposed according to coping theory [ ]. Through preliminary experiments, we identified two factors that contribute to social responses to frustrating situations, consistent with the Rosenzweig model. However, although the Rosenzweig model is a 3 \u00d7 3 factorial design (i.e., direction of aggression involving self, another person, and nothing \u00d7 type of aggression, involving attention to the frustrating event itself, to the cause of the frustrating situation, and a to solution to the frustrating situation) [ , ], social responses in our results consisted of a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design (i.e., self/other performing \u00d7 containing/not containing a solution). Logical thought requires that social responses corresponding to self-/other-performing are consistent with those directing aggression toward the self and another person, respectively. However, those corresponding to the direction of aggression involving requests toward nothing were excluded from our stimuli through the discriminant analysis. The number of responses that were requests toward nothing was not sufficient to create a significant category. For the type-of-aggression factor, we could regard those with attention to the frustrating event itself and to a cause of the frustrating situation as \u201cno solution\u201d and regard a solution to the frustrating situation as containing a solution. Although a 3 \u00d7 3 factorial design was integrated into a 2 \u00d7 2 design, at least two factors of the Rosenzweig model were replicated in the present study. \n\nMoreover, we found specific neural responses under SW conditions that were related to socially adaptive responses [ ]. In the current study, we focused on the internal (i.e., self-performing) and external (i.e., containing a solution that implicitly responds to external demands) causality of social responses. Adaptive social responses may have a stronger association with external causal attributions than do non-adaptive social responses because the definition of social adaptation [ ] refers to managing environmental demands to solve problems, which corresponds to external causality. Although other definitions of adaptation have been proposed [ , ], the one developed by Lazarus [ ] was congruent with respect to specificity. Therefore, our data showing that a specific neural response was elicited only when adaptive behavior was observed support the appropriateness of the definition proposed by Lazarus [ ] for use in efforts examining the biological underpinnings of socially adaptive responses. \n\n\n### Causality scores and psychological measurements \n  \nWe found a significant correlation between causality scores and responses to the psychological questionnaires. This finding suggests that the internal causal attribution of adaptive social responses (i.e., the SW condition) requires self-control and the ability to control anger behavior in frustrating situations. Moreover, self-performing responses (i.e., the SW and SWo conditions), which put no burden on others, were associated with a cooperative personality. This is in contrast to the OWo condition, which represents a complaining/accusing attitude and is associated with a less cooperative personality. These findings reinforce the validity of the causality scores, as we predicted. \n\nOn the other hand, we observed an apparent discrepancy between the behavioral and fMRI results regarding causality scores. Although we found a significant main effect of solution and a significant interaction in the causality scores among the four conditions, we did not detect a significant main effect or interaction among the parameter estimates derived from the parametric modulation analysis. The results of the parametric modulation model depend on within-subject variation in the causality scores under each condition, whereas the mean values of the causality scores reflect individual variability across subjects. Thus, the result related to the specificity of parameter estimates under the SW condition was robust. \n\n\n### Right anterior temporal lobe \n  \nAlthough previous neuroimaging studies have not reported right anterior temporal lobe involvement in causal attributions, the cognitive function of this region highlights the importance of integrated processing for adaptive social behavior. A previous review suggested that the lateral prefrontal cortices contributed to adaptive social reasoning because they had been shown to mediate cognitive functions, such as social exchange, simulation, integration, deductive and inductive inference, and social cognition [ ]. One interpretation of our results is that adaptive social behaviors with an external causal attribution (i.e., less natural social responses) require a high cognitive load for the integration of emotional and social information. Previous studies have shown right anterior temporal lobe involvement in cognitive integration in social contexts. For example, this region was activated during the bottom-up processing of breaches occurring in social contexts, such as social norm violations [ ] and social\u2013cognitive conflicts [ ]. Additionally, this region is involved in the top-down processing of comprehension in a social context, such as moral reasoning [ , ], mentalizing (understanding others\u2019 intentions) [ ], irony [ ], and abstract conceptual knowledge [ ]. Olson et al. argued that the right anterior temporal lobe was involved in the emotional processing associated with social relationships (socio\u2013emotional processing) [ ]. Other reports have suggested that the functional role of the anterior temporal lobe can be understood in terms of its serving as a semantic hub mediating social\u2013emotional processing [ ]. In addition to these cognitive processes, the region plays a role in behavioral processes, such as producing communicative speech in a social context [ ]. Thus, neural activation in this region integrates social stimuli involving the social demands of frustrating situations. Such social demands constitute the characteristics of external causal attribution, particularly in the context of an adaptive social behavior. The functional role of this region highlights the importance of integration in the performance of adaptive social behaviors. \n\n\n### Neural networks for social responses to frustrating situations \n  \nThe neural networks associated with social responses to frustrating situations identified in the present study are consistent with those previously reported in neuroimaging studies investigating social behaviors. These brain areas are part of the brain network that mediates social cognition and behavior [ , ], such as mentalizing [ ], social interaction [ ], and communicative speech production [ ]. Furthermore, they are related to judgments about the adaptiveness of behavior in relation to a social context with regard to considerations such as social norms [ , ] and moral judgments [ , , ]. A comparison of our results with previous findings suggests that subjects must understand the meaning of a social situation to produce communicative speech during the acting task, and that this may be related to environmental demands. \n\nWe failed to find neural correlates of adaptive social responses via conventional subtraction analyses (i.e., contrast between adaptive and non-adaptive responses). On the other hand, after fitting the causality scores, we were able to detect adaptive-specific neural responses. The results indicate that the concept of causality is needed in attempts to identify the neural correlates of adaptive-specific neural responses under experimental conditions. \n\n\n### Methodological considerations and future studies \n  \nCertain methodological issues in our experiment must be considered. First, the validity of our novel methodology was supported by both psychobehavioral and fMRI results. The correlation between the causality scores and the psychological measures reinforce the validity of the causality scores. Moreover, the significant correlation between neural activation and the causality scores, together with the role of the right anterior temporal lobe in cognitive function, enabled us to interpret the fMRI results and support the validity of our novel methodology. \n\nSecond, the reason we failed to find a significant positive correlation between brain activity and causality scores in any experimental condition should be considered. We believe this was the result of the definition we used for adaptation and the characteristics of our acting task. The definition of adaptiveness, which focused on environmental demands corresponding to an external causal attribution, was taken from Lazarus\u2019 1984 article [ ]. Furthermore, our acting task was designed to emphasize a frustrating situation corresponding to external causal attributions. Thus, the subjects were likely to process an external causal attribution, derived as a negative correlation between brain activation and the causality scores, more explicitly. Separate studies optimized to highlight internal causal attribution are necessary to address natural adaptive social behaviors. To accomplish this, an alternative definition of adaptiveness, focusing on the processes used to manage environmental and internal demands [ , ], must be developed. Consistent with this definition [ , ], the internal demands were related to real-life adaptive social behaviors, which could be derived as a positive correlation. \n\nThe final issue is gender differences in the adaptive social responses to frustrating situations. Although a previous study reported a gender difference in the response to social stimuli [ ], we did not examine gender differences in adaptive social behaviors. We were only able to recruit eight female subjects for the present study and found no significant differences in this subsample. We assessed the issue of mixed data from all male and female subjects and found that an analysis of the results from the male subjects alone showed the same tendency as did the results for all subjects. Thus, we believe the results are valid despite the small number of female participants. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis is the first reported study to investigate the neural correlates of adaptive social behaviors by assessing causal attributions using hypothetical scenarios under experimental conditions. We believe this novel approach has the potential to open up entirely new areas of research using neuroimaging methods. In particular, we believe that the recent development of a visual cortex decoding device using neuroimaging techniques gives neuroimaging studies the potential to provide objective assessment tools for clinical settings. \n\n\n## Competing interests \n  \nWe have no conflicts of interest to declare. \n\n\n## Authors\u2019 contributions \n  \nAll authors contributed to the concept and design of the present study.

Studies in rodents and nonhuman primates suggest that EC can be divided into subregions that connect differentially with perirhinal cortex (PRC) vs parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and with hippocampal subfields along the proximo-distal axis. Here, we used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla to identify functional subdivisions of the human EC. In two independent datasets, PRC showed preferential intrinsic functional connectivity with anterior-lateral EC and PHC with posterior-medial EC. These EC subregions, in turn, exhibited differential connectivity with proximal and distal subiculum. In contrast, connectivity of PRC and PHC with subiculum followed not only a proximal-distal but also an anterior-posterior gradient. Our data provide the first evidence that the human EC can be divided into functional subdivisions whose functional connectivity closely parallels the known anatomical connectivity patterns of the rodent and nonhuman primate EC. \n\n DOI:  \n   eLife digest  \nIn the early 1950s, an American named Henry Molaison underwent an experimental type of brain surgery to treat his severe epilepsy. The surgeon removed a region of the brain known as the temporal lobe from both sides of his brain. After the surgery, Molaison's epilepsy was greatly improved, but he was also left with a profound amnesia, unable to form new memories of recent events. \n\nSubsequent experiments, including many with Molaison himself as a subject, have attempted to identify the roles of the various structures within the temporal lobes. The hippocampus\u2014which is involved in memory and spatial navigation\u2014has received the most attention, but in recent years a region called the entorhinal cortex has also come to the fore. Known as the gateway to the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex relays sensory information from the outer cortex of the brain to the hippocampus. \n\nIn rats and mice the entorhinal cortex can be divided into two subregions that have distinct connections to other parts of the temporal lobe. The \u2018medial entorhinal cortex\u2019 is the subregion nearest the centre of the brain, and it predominantly connects to parahippocampal cortex, which is involved in processing visual scenes. The other subregion, the \u2018lateral entorhinal cortex\u2019, is to the left or right of the center and has particularly strong connections to the perirhinal cortex, which is involved in the memory of objects. The two subregions are also connected to different parts of the hippocampus. \n\nFor many years researchers had assumed that the connectivity of the human entorhinal cortex was quite similar to that observed in rats and mice. However, it was not possible to check this as the entorhinal cortex measures less than about 1 cm across, which placed it beyond the reach of most commonly available brain-imaging techniques. Now, two independent groups of researchers have used ultra high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to reveal a more complex structure in humans. The fMRI data reveal that the entorhinal cortex is divided into an anterior-lateral (to the front and at the side) subregion and a posterior-medial (to the back and at the centre) subregion in humans. \n\nOne of the groups\u2014Maass, Berron et al.\u2014used the imaging data to show that the anterior-lateral and posterior-medial subregions of the entorhinal cortex form distinct patterns of connections with the perirhinal cortex and the parahippocampal cortex, as well as with different parts of the hippocampus. The other group\u2014Navarro Schr\u00f6der, Haak et al.\u2014studied functional connections across the whole neocortex to come to the same conclusions. \n\nThe discovery of these networks in the temporal lobe in humans will help to bridge the gap between studies of memory in rodents and in humans. Given that the lateral entorhinal cortex is one of the first regions to be affected in Alzheimer's disease, identifying the specific properties and roles of these networks could also provide insights into disease mechanisms. \n\n DOI:  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe entorhinal cortex (EC) is a major hub within the medial temporal lobe that mediates hippocampal-neocortical communication ( ;  ). Together with the adjacent perirhinal cortex (PRC) and parahippocampal cortex (PHC), these brain regions form a neural circuitry that is critical for learning and memory ( ;  ). Virtually nothing is known about how hippocampal and neocortical connectivity with the EC is organized in humans. This lack of knowledge has significantly limited the development of neurobiological theories of memory and navigation and our understanding of the clinical impact of localized EC damage in the early stages of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). \n\nNeuroanatomical evidence from studies in rodents suggests that there are two parallel input pathways that convey spatial and non-spatial input into the hippocampus via the EC ( ;  ;  ). Specifically, spatial information is conveyed from the postrhinal cortex (POR, thought to be homologous to the PHC in primates), which shows preferential connectivity with \u2018medial EC\u2019 (MEC). In contrast, non-spatial information is conveyed from the PRC to the \u2018lateral EC\u2019 (LEC). LEC and MEC, in turn, are differentially connected with hippocampal subfields (i.e., subiculum and CA1) along the proximo-distal (transverse) axis. Projections of the LEC preferentially target the region close to the border between CA1 and subiculum (distal CA1 and proximal subiculum), whereas the MEC preferentially projects to proximal CA1 and distal subiculum (e.g.,  ;  ). These partially segregated pathways have been differentially associated with the processing of, and memory for, object and context information (e.g.,  ; for review see;  ;  ;  ). Moreover, a recent network analysis on the rat connectome highlighted the LEC as a major cortical hub, forming the richest set of association connections of any cerebral cortical region ( ). \n\nNotably, although terminology for EC subdivisions in the rat emphasizes the lateral to medial axis, these areas do not differ solely with respect to their position in relation to the hippocampal formation and the rhinal fissure ( ). In actuality, LEC occupies the rostrolateral portion of the EC, whereas MEC occupies the caudomedial portion of the EC. In primates, ventral hippocampus and the adjacent EC are situated in a relatively more rostral position in the anterior temporal lobe. Although the position of the EC on the cortical surface and the orientation of anatomical axes differ across species, the relative topography of EC connectivity seems to be preserved in nonhuman primates. Anatomical studies suggest that the PRC is predominantly interconnected with the anterior third of the EC, whereas the PHC is predominantly interconnected with approximately the posterior two-thirds ( ). In addition, PRC/PHC connectivity with EC differs between lateral and medial domains ( ). A functional distinction between anterior and posterior EC has been substantiated by a single-unit recording study of grid-cell-like neurons in nonhuman primates ( ). \n\nTo summarize, findings from rodents and nonhuman primates suggest that connectivity of the human EC might differ along the longitudinal and lateral-medial axis, but because anatomical tracing studies cannot be performed in humans, direct evidence for this idea is lacking. Recent structural and functional MRI studies have assumed a lateral-medial distinction in humans according to the rodent nomenclature of LEC and MEC. However, whether such a lateral-medial dissociation of EC connectivity exists in humans and/or whether connectivity differs along the anterior-posterior EC axis has not been assessed so far. \n\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that networks of brain regions linked by direct and indirect anatomical connections exhibit temporally coherent, low-frequency fluctuations in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data during both the resting and task states. Recent work has demonstrated that spatially contiguous but anatomically distinct brain regions can be reliably differentiated based on functional connectivity profiles measured with BOLD fMRI (for a review see  ). Using fMRI at 3 Tesla, human resting-state fMRI studies ( ;  ) have reported reliable differences in connectivity between the PRC and PHC with the hippocampus. Whereas the PRC showed higher functional connectivity with the anterior hippocampus, the PHC showed stronger connectivity with the posterior hippocampus, a dissociation that was most evident for subiculum and CA1 subfields ( ). Due to limitations in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution, these studies were unable to assess functional connectivity with the EC. \n\nHere, we used ultra-high resolution fMRI at 7 Tesla to characterize the functional organization of the human EC. The high SNR of MRI data collected at 7 Tesla makes it feasible to acquire BOLD fMRI data at an unprecedented level of anatomical detail (e.g.,  ). To determine the topographic organization of EC connectivity in humans, we conducted two experiments in which fMRI data were acquired with a resolution of 0.8 mm (isotropic). Notably, this level of spatial resolution is more than six times higher than in previous high-resolution fMRI studies that investigated intrinsic connectivity within the MTL ( ;  ). In two independent samples, we examined correlations of activation between individually anatomically defined PRC vs PHC seeds and the EC along its anterior-posterior and lateral-medial axis. In addition, we tested whether functionally distinct EC subregions also exhibited differential connectivity with the subiculum along a transverse or longitudinal hippocampal axis. In addition, we also analyzed connectivity profiles of PRC and PHC seeds with the subiculum. The present study, which focuses on patterns of EC connectivity within the MTL is complemented by a study by  , which examined connectivity topography of the EC with extended cortical networks outside of the MTL. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Entorhinal connectivity topography related to PRC and PHC seeds \n  \n#### Seed-to-voxel connectivity of PRC vs PHC with EC \n  \nWe used 7T high-resolution fMRI to characterize and compare intrinsic functional connectivity profiles of PHC and PRC seed regions with the EC. Particularly, we investigated correlations of activity over time (spontaneous changes in the BOLD signal) between individually defined PRC and PHC seed regions and the EC across subjects. Seed-to-voxel correlation analyses were performed on the native (unnormalized) residual fMRI data after extraction of task-related activity (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section for details). Resulting connectivity maps were normalized on a group-specific T1-template by means of Region of Interest-Advanced Normalization Tools (ROI-ANTS;  ;  ;  ). The template has the same resolution and alignment as the functional images, such that coronal images (as in  ) are oriented orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. Note that our terminology of axes (anterior-posterior, lateral-medial and dorsal-ventral) always refers to the longitudinal hippocampal axis, although the hippocampus has a slightly upward-tilted position when moving from anterior to posterior within the brain. Group results maps were masked with a manually-defined EC ROI.

Bright regions denote overlapping connectivity with PRC/PHC. Single-subject beta maps were normalized on the group-specific T1-template by ROI-based alignment with ANTS and masked with a manually defined EC ROI. The T1-template has the same resolution (and alignment) as the high-resolution functional EPI volumes (0.8 mm \u00d7 0.8 mm \u00d7 0.8 mm). See also   for results of Exp. 2.

While the PRC showed significant connectivity with bilateral EC clusters covering approximately the anterior two-thirds of the EC, significant functional connectivity of the PHC was found with bilateral EC clusters comprising about the posterior two-thirds of the EC (see also peak coordinates of significant clusters in  ). Additionally, PRC-connectivity clusters were limited to progressively more lateral regions of the EC when moving posteriorly while PHC-connectivity clusters were limited to progressively more medial regions of the EC when moving anteriorly. Overlapping connectivity with both seeds was strongest in the transition zone between anterior-posterior and lateral-medial EC (see bright regions in   and  ).   \nUnivariate group-results for seed-to-voxel connectivity of PRC and PHC seeds with the EC \n\n DOI:  \n    \n\nPaired t-tests revealed those EC regions that exhibited significant stronger connectivity with PRC than PHC seeds, and vice versa (see  ). While stronger functional connectivity of the PRC was found with bilateral clusters in the anterior-lateral EC (al-EC), the PHC showed relatively stronger connectivity with bilateral clusters located in the posterior-medial EC (pm-EC). Paired t-test results are illustrated for Experiment 1 on  .    Differential connectivity topography of PRC vs PHC seeds with the EC for Experiment 1.  \n(  A  ) To assess differential connectivity of PRC vs PHC with the EC, voxelwise paired-sample t-tests were performed on the normalized single-subject beta maps (resulting from seed-to-voxel connectivity analyses). Significant clusters for Exp. 1 are shown for two coronal sample slices (Z > 2.3. p  < 0.05, N  = 15) at the level of the anterior (1) and posterior (2) hippocampal head. (  B  ) To visualize the 3-dimensional geometry of connectivity, the connectivity preference with PRC vs PHC of each EC voxel was plotted along the x-, y-, and z-axis (red: T  > 0, blue: T  > 0). Axes terminology is relative to the long-axis of the hippocampus. (  C  ) Classification of PRC vs PHC connectivity preference was tested across subjects based on the x-y-z coordinate of an EC voxel. Multivariate classification (support vector machine; leave-one-subject-out cross-validation) was significant across both data sets (p < 0.001; accuracies: Exp. 1: left: 62%, right: 60%, Exp. 2: left: 67%, right: 57%), which confirms a spatial dissociation of entorhinal connectivity with PRC vs PHC. Predicted clusters are color-coded in red vs. blue, bright regions denote high consistency of the classifier (accuracy for each voxel across subjects). Results are shown for Exp. 1. See also   for 3D plots of Exp. 2 and for unilateral seeds of Exp. 1. \n\n DOI:  \n \n   Differential connectivity topography of bilateral (  A  ) and unilateral (  B  ) PRC vs PHC seeds with the EC for Experiment 2 (  A  ) and Experiment 1 (  B  ).  \n DOI:  \n  \n \n\n\n#### Three-dimensional topography of entorhinal connectivity \n  \nIn order to assess and visualize the 3-dimensional topography of differential EC connectivity with PRC vs PHC seeds, we plotted the connectivity preference of each voxel along the x-y-z direction (see   and  ). Connectivity preference was defined on the basis of the paired t-test t-maps (red: T  > 0; blue: T  > 0). These plots indicated a complex 3-dimensional topography of EC connectivity with a gradient of PRC-to-PHC preference running from anterior-ventral-lateral to posterior-dorsal-medial EC. In addition, we plotted functional connectivity preference of unilateral (left and right) PRC/PHC seeds with both the ipsi- and contralateral EC to evaluate whether connectivity patterns were symmetric across hemispheres (see   for results of data set 1). These additional analyses confirmed the findings of bilateral connectivity analyses with an anterior-posterior and lateral-medial gradient of EC connectivity for contralateral PRC and PHC seeds. These findings also suggest that the dissociation of EC connectivity cannot be simply explained by local autocorrelations of neighboring voxels. \n\nOur next analyses assessed the reliability of topographic differences in EC connectivity with PHC and PRC. If the topographic organization is reliable across participants, then it should be possible to predict the connectivity preference of specific EC voxels within any participant, simply by knowing the connectivity preferences of corresponding voxels in other participants. To test this strong prediction, we conducted a multivariate pattern classification analysis using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme. Specifically, we trained a multivariate support vector machine classifier (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section) on data from all but one subject, entering only the x-, y-, and z-coordinates of each voxel and the relative preference of PRC and PHC connectivity (based on the subject's paired t-test t-maps, analogous to the definition of preference in the previous section). The classifier was then tested on the remaining subject, and the accuracy of this validation step was calculated as the proportion of EC voxels that were classified correctly as being preferentially connected to PRC or PHC in the tested subject. The training and cross-validation steps were repeated for all combinations of participants, and a mean classification accuracy score was computed. Classification accuracy was significantly above chance across both data sets (p < 0.001). Mean classifier accuracies across all EC voxels and subjects were around 60% (Exp. 1: left 62%, right 60%, Exp. 2: left 67%, right 57%). However, connectivity preference of voxels in the very anterior-lateral and posterior-medial EC could be predicted with more than 80% accuracy. These analyses confirm a spatial dissociation in connectivity between EC subregions with regard to PRC vs PHC seeds. Predicted clusters of preferential connectivity are color-coded in   (bright regions denote high consistency of the classifier). \n\nMoreover, we repeated the classification analysis on the combined data of both studies to predict al-EC and pm-EC functional subregions (based on preferential connectivity with PRC vs PHC) across all participants. Anatomical landmarks for these clusters are described further below in \u2018Landmarks for delineation of al-EC and pm-EC\u2019 and al-EC and pm-EC masks in template and MNI space are available online ( ). Moreover, predicted al-EC and pm-EC subregions as well as the subicular and parahippocampal subregions are shown in a 3D animation in  .    3D animation of entorhinal, subicular and parahippocampal subregions.  \n DOI:  \n  \n\n\n#### PRC and PHC show significantly different connectivity patterns along the transverse and longitudinal axis of the EC \n  \nAnatomical studies in rodents have demonstrated a rostrolateral-caudomedial dissociation of EC connectivity with PRC vs PHC, and data in nonhuman primates suggest a similar gradient of differential connectivity along anterior-posterior and lateral-medial axes ( ;  ;  ). In order to directly test for significant differences of PRC vs PHC intrinsic functional connectivity between the anterior vs posterior and lateral vs medial EC, we divided the template EC ROI equally into four portions: anterior-lateral, anterior-medial, posterior-lateral and posterior-medial (see  , right panel). Mean parameter estimates for PRC and PHC connectivity (mean betas) were extracted across all voxels in each section for each subject. Note that the lateral-medial split was performed for each coronal slice individually as the EC is curved along the longitudinal axis and furthermore, that this separation also corresponds to a ventral-dorsal split.    Anterior-posterior and lateral-medial gradients of entorhinal connectivity with PRC vs PHC seeds.  \n(  A  ) To test for an anterior-posterior or lateral-medial dissociation of EC connectivity with PRC vs PHC seeds (upper panel, left), we divided the EC template mask into four equal portions (upper panel, right) and extracted mean parameter estimates (betas) from each subsection. (  B  ) Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed significant seed (PRC vs PHC) \u00d7 anterior-posterior EC section and seed \u00d7 lateral-medial EC section interactions (p < 0.001 for both data sets; N  = 15, N  = 14). Slice-by-slice plots of connectivity estimates along the longitudinal and transverse EC axis confirmed an anterior-to-posterior and lateral-to-medial dissociation with decreasing PRC-connectivity and increasing PHC-connectivity. As the number of sagittal EC slices differed from anterior to posterior, we divided each coronal EC slice into 5 equal portions (with 1 being most lateral and 5 most medial EC) and calculated mean betas for each portion. \n\n DOI:  \n  \n\nRepeated-measures ANOVAs with PRC and PHC connectivity estimates revealed significant two-way interactions of seed region \u00d7 anterior-posterior EC section (Exp. 1: F(1,14) = 56.0, p < 0.001; Exp. 2: F(1,13) = 95.9, p < 0.001) and seed region \u00d7 lateral-medial EC section (Exp. 1: F(1,14) = 11.3, p = 0.005; Exp. 2: F(1,13) = 32.8, p < 0.001). \n\nFollow-up paired sample t-tests confirmed significantly greater PRC than PHC connectivity with the anterior EC (Exp. 1: t(14) = 5.3; p < 0.001; Exp. 2: t(13) = 4.5, p = 0.001) and vice versa significant higher PHC than PRC connectivity with the posterior EC (Exp. 1: t(14) = 4.7; p < 0.001; Exp. 2: t(13) = 2.6; p = 0.019). With regard to the lateral-medial dissociation, the PRC showed significantly higher intrinsic functional connectivity than the PHC with the lateral EC section (Exp. 1: t(14) = 5.2; p < 0.001; Exp. 2: t(13) = 3.8, p = 0.002). However, there was no significant difference in connectivity between seeds with the medial section of the EC (all p-values > 0.80). Although connectivity estimates did not differ in the medial EC portion, the PHC showed significantly stronger connectivity with medial than lateral EC (Exp. 1: t(14) = 4.4; p < 0.001; Exp. 2 t(13) = 2.6, p = 0.021). There were no significant three-way interactions between seed, longitudinal and sagittal EC section (all p-values > 0.25). \n\nTo characterize the topography of PRC and PHC functional connectivity with voxels along the longitudinal (anterior to posterior) and transverse (lateral to medial) axis of the EC, we plotted mean parameter estimates for each slice (see  ). These slice-by-slice plots further confirmed a dominant topographical organization of EC connectivity along the longitudinal axis with decreasing PRC connectivity and increasing PHC connectivity from anterior to posterior to EC. Furthermore, lateral to medial connectivity plots demonstrated decreasing PRC and increasing PHC connectivity. \n\n\n\n### Subicular connectivity profiles related to functional EC subregions and PRC/PHC \n  \n#### EC subregions differentially interact with proximal and distal subiculum \n  \nAnatomical studies in rodents have demonstrated that LEC and MEC exhibit different patterns of connectivity along the proximo-distal (transverse) axis of the subiculum and CA1 (e.g.,  ). Similarly, anterolateral vs posteromedial EC regions in nonhuman primates have been shown to exhibit differential connectivity with proximal vs distal subiculum and CA1 ( ). These findings motivated us to test whether functional connectivity between our functional EC subregions and the hippocampus is topographically organized. Within the hippocampus, we focused on the subiculum, based on previous findings demonstrating that the topographic organization of cortico-hippocampal functional connectivity is most prominent in the subiculum ( ). \n\nConsistent with our previous analyses for the EC, we divided the subiculum into four equal portions along the longitudinal (anterior vs posterior) and transverse (lateral [\u2018proximal\u2019] vs medial [\u2018distal\u2019]) axis. We then extracted mean parameter estimates of functional connectivity with anterior-lateral and posterior-medial EC for each subicular section and each subject and submitted them to a factorial ANOVA to test for connectivity differences as a function of EC subregion (al-EC vs pm-EC) and anterior vs posterior and proximal vs distal subiculum subregions. Similar to the division of the EC, we performed the proximal-distal cut individually for each coronal subiculum slice. \n\nRepeated-measures ANOVAs with EC seed connectivity estimates revealed a significant two-way interaction of seed EC subregion \u00d7 proximal vs distal subiculum (Exp. 1: F(1,14) = 25.7, p < 0.001; Exp. 2: F(1,13) = 24.3, p < 0.001). However, there was no interaction between EC seed region and longitudinal subiculum sections (p > 0.26). Follow-up t-tests confirmed that the proximal subiculum showed significantly greater connectivity with al-EC than with pm-EC (Exp. 1: t(14) = 2.27; p = 0.040; Exp. 2: t(13) = 2.15; p = 0.049) and, conversely, that distal subiculum showed significantly greater connectivity with pm-EC than with al-EC (Exp. 1: t(14) = 3.06; p = 0.008; Exp. 2: t(13) = 4.24, p = 0.001). Slice-by-slice plots confirmed that connectivity of the al-EC decreased from proximal (lateral) to distal (medial) subiculum, whereas pm-EC connectivity increased (see   and   for data of Experiment 1 and 2, respectively).    Functional connectivity gradients in the subiculum related to EC subregions and PRC/PHC seeds.  \n(  A  ) To test for differential connectivity of EC functional subdivisions with the subiculum, anterior-lateral EC (al-EC) and posterior-medial EC (pm-EC) regions that exhibited preferential connectivity with PRC vs PHC, respectively (see paired t-tests in  ) were used as seed regions. The subiculum ROI was equally divided into four portions along the longitudinal (anterior vs posterior) and transverse (proximal vs distal) axis and mean betas of functional connectivity with EC seeds extracted for each subsection. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed a significant seed (al-EC vs pm-EC) \u00d7 proximal-distal subiculum interaction in both datasets (p < 0.001; N  = 15, N  = 14; results shown for Exp. 1). Slice-by-slice plots of connectivity estimates demonstrated decreasing al-EC-connectivity and increasing pm-EC connectivity from proximal to distal subiculum but no anterior-posterior dissociation. (  B  ) Similarly, connectivity for PRC vs PHC seeds with the subiculum along the longitudinal and transverse axis was evaluated. Seed (PRC vs PHC) \u00d7 proximal-distal subiculum section interactions were significant across both datasets (p < 0.01) with preferential connectivity of PRC with proximal and PHC with distal subiculum, respectively. Slice-by-slice plots of connectivity estimates along the hippocampal long axis revealed stronger PRC connectivity with the most anterior and stronger PHC connectivity with the most posterior subiculum (= 8 slices), respectively (Exp. 1). See also   for data of Exp. 2. \n\n DOI:  \n \n   Functional connectivity gradients in the subiculum related to EC subregions (  A  ) and PRC/PHC seeds (  B  ) for Experiment 2.  \n DOI:  \n  \n \n\n\n#### Repeated-measures ANOVAs and slice-by-slice plots for PRC/PHC seeds \n  \nPrevious human resting-state fMRI studies at 3 Tesla ( ;  ) have reported reliable differences in connectivity between the PRC and PHC with the hippocampus along the longitudinal hippocampal axis, most prominently with the subiculum ( ). However, a dissociation of PRC vs PHC connectivity along the proximo-distal axis of the subiculum, as demonstrated between PRC and POR in rodents ( ,  ;  ), has not been reported so far in humans. \n\nIn order to examine whether PRC vs PHC seeds show differential intrinsic functional connectivity with the subiculum along the transverse and/or longitudinal axis, we also tested for significant interactions between PRC vs PHC connectivity with anterior vs posterior or proximal vs distal subiculum. Repeated-measures ANOVAs with PRC and PHC connectivity estimates revealed a significant two-way interaction of seed region \u00d7 proximal vs distal subiculum (Exp. 1: F(1,14) = 20.2, p = 0.001; Exp. 2: F(1,13) = 14.4, p = 0.002). However, the interaction between seed and anterior vs posterior subiculum was not significant (Exp. 1: F(1,14) = 2.5, p = 0.135; Exp. 2: F(1,13) = 1.4, p = 0.257). \n\nFollow-up t-tests confirmed significantly greater PRC than PHC connectivity with the proximal subiculum (Exp. 1: t(14) = 3.7; p = 0.002; Exp. 2: t(13) = 3.9, p = 0.002). With regard to distal subiculum there was significant higher PHC than PRC connectivity in Experiment 1 (t(14) = 3.1, p = 0.009) and a trend towards a difference in Experiment 2 (t(13) = 2.0; p = 0.063). \n\nSlice-by-slice plots further confirmed a dissociation of PRC/PHC connectivity along the transverse hippocampal axis with decreasing PRC connectivity and increasing PHC connectivity from proximal to distal subiculum (see   and   for data of Experiment 1 and 2, respectively). Although the interaction between PRC vs PHC seed and anterior-posterior subiculum was not significant, slice-by-slice extractions suggested that differential connectivity may be present in the most anterior and most posterior slices of subiculum. Additional analyses indeed revealed that PRC connectivity was significantly greater than PHC connectivity within the most anterior 8 slices of subiculum (Exp. 1: t(14) = 2.5; p = 0.022; Exp. 2: t(13) = 3.9, p = 0.002), while PHC connectivity was significantly higher than PRC connectivity within the most posterior 8 slices in Experiment 1 (t(14) = 2.3; p = 0.035 ), but not in Experiment 2 (t(13) < 1, p > 0.4). \n\nHowever, we note that we did not segment the subiculum within the hippocampal tail (where anatomical borders are difficult to delineate) and thus might underestimate any difference in the posterior subiculum. \n\n\n#### The topographic organization of PRC and PHC connectivity with subiculum differs from that of al-EC and pm-EC with subiculum \n  \nThe above analyses revealed that the connectivity differences between al-EC and pm-EC along the transverse axis of the subiculum parallel the differences between PRC and PHC. However, only PRC and PHC seeds showed dissociable connectivity gradients along the longitudinal axis of the subiculum, whereas no such difference was seen between al-EC and pm-EC. This suggests that the gradients of al-EC and pm-EC connectivity with subiculum are not merely a reflection of their differential connectivity with PRC and PHC. To quantify the differences between the connectivity profiles of entorhinal functional subregions and PRC/PHC along the long axis of the subiculum, we calculated differences between al-EC/pm-EC and PRC/PHC connectivity estimates for anterior and posterior subiculum subsections. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed a significant interaction between seed regions (\u2206al-EC/pm-EC vs \u2206PRC/PHC) \u00d7 longitudinal subiculum section (anterior vs posterior) for Experiment 1 (F(1,14) = 7.3, p = 0.017) with a similar trend evident in the dataset of Experiment 2 (F(1,13) = 3.4, p = 0.087). These additional analyses show that functional connectivity profiles of PRC vs PHC and al-EC vs pm-EC with the subiculum differ along the longitudinal hippocampal axis. \n\n\n#### Landmarks for delineation of al-EC and pm-EC \n  \nWe used the multivariate classification approach to predict al-EC and pm-EC subregions across all subjects. Based on the relative connectivity preference of an EC voxel across subjects the classifier predicts PRC or PHC connectivity preference for the left out subject. Thereby we can compute consistency maps that show the consistency of predictions for each EC voxel across all subjects. This revealed regions of high and low consistency. Based on the predictions of the classifier we created a PRC-connectivity preference (\u2018al-EC\u2019) and a PHC-connectivity preference EC (\u2018pm-EC\u2019) mask. To provide these masks in a more usable manner (not on a partial volume T1-template), we created a whole brain high-resolution T1-template based on the MPRAGEs of all participants (N = 29; voxel size: 0.6 mm  isotropic, AC-PC aligned). We then aligned the EC masks on the whole-brain template (linear registration) and manually corrected outer borders, if these did not fit perfectly. \n\nBelow, we further describe the approximate boundaries of al- and pm-EC subregions based on coronal slices, moving from anterior to posterior on the whole brain template. These landmarks can be used for manual delineation of EC functional subregions. Notably, coronal slices on the whole-brain template are not orthogonally aligned to the hippocampal long-axis and have a different slice thickness compared to the partial-volume template on which results/figures are described. Furthermore, borders between al-EC and pm-EC differed slightly between hemispheres and thus landmarks are an intermediate approximation between sides. \n\nAt the most anterior level of the EC (when the amygdala is visible) EC is fully covered by al-EC. Moving posteriorly, the hippocampal head (HH) starts. Around 3\u20134 slices (\u223c2 mm) after the first appearance of the HH, pm-EC appears at the very medial/dorsal tip of the EC, touching the amygdala. The border between pm-EC and al-EC approximately corresponds to the uncal notch, such that pm-EC covers the gyrus ambiens. Moving more posteriorly the border between pm-EC and al-EC moves progressively down (more lateral/ventral) until al-EC and pm-EC are around equal size at the level of two thirds of HH. At this level the amygdala has fully disappeared. Going further posteriorly the border between pm-EC and al-EC moves progressively more lateral/ventral, such that pm-EC also covers parts of the ventral/lateral EC half. At the level where the uncus separates from the HC (and only the fimbria is attached to both), the EC is almost fully covered by pm-EC. We delineated the EC until the collateral sulcus (or rhinal fissure) disappeared, which was one slice (0.6 mm) after disappearance of the uncus. Approximately the four most posterior EC slices (\u223c2.4 mm) were fully covered by pm-EC. \n\nAl-EC and pm-EC masks as well as the whole brain T1-template are available online in original ( ; resolution: 0.6 mm  isotropic) and MNI space ( ; resolution: 2 mm  isotropic). Furthermore, location of al-EC and pm-EC in relation to PRC, PHC and proximal vs distal subiculum is visualized in  . \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe report the first detailed topographic parcellation of the human EC on the basis of its functional connectivity with neocortical and hippocampal subregions. In two independent samples, our analyses revealed that anterior-lateral and posterior-medial EC subregions (al-EC and pm-EC, respectively) exhibited distinct patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity with regions in the neocortex (PRC and PHC) and hippocampal formation (subiculum). Specifically, the al-EC region could be delineated on the basis of preferential connectivity with PRC, whereas the borders of pm-EC were derived from connectivity with PHC. Al-EC and pm-EC, in turn, were found to have preferential connectivity with proximal and distal subiculum, respectively. Moreover, the pattern of subiculum connectivity with al-EC and pm-EC was partially distinct from its connectivity with PRC and PHC. A schematic summary of functional connectivity gradients in the subiculum related to PRC/PHC seeds and EC subdivisions is illustrated in  . These results reveal the functional topography of the human EC as a gateway between neocortex and hippocampus and show remarkable accordance with principles known from anatomical studies of rodents (rostrolateral vs caudomedial; for reviews see  ;  ) and studies of nonhuman primates (anterolateral vs posteromedial; see e.g.,  ;  ). As we describe below, these data provide a link between basic and translational research on the human medial temporal lobes ( ;  ) and results from detailed circuit level analyses of the rodent hippocampal formation (e.g.,  ).    Schematic summary of functional connectivity gradients in the subiculum related to PRC/PHC seeds and EC subdivisions.  \n(  A  ) Functional connectivity analyses revealed preferential connectivity of PRC (red) with the anterior-lateral EC and PHC (blue) with the posterior-medial EC. Regarding the subiculum, PRC showed strongest connectivity with most anterior and proximal parts, whereas PHC showed strongest connectivity with most posterior and distal parts of the subiculum. (  B  ) Anterior-lateral (red) and posterior-medial (blue) EC exhibited a similar dissociation in connectivity with the subiculum along its transverse (proximal-distal) axis but there was no trend for a dissociation of entorhinal connectivity along the longitudinal axis of the subiculum. \n\n DOI:  \n  \n\nPrevious fMRI studies have used functional connectivity analyses on data collected at 3T to characterize topographic patterns of connectivity between the PRC, PHC, and hippocampal subfields ( ;  ). These studies have generally found that PRC and PHC exhibit different patterns of connectivity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. Unfortunately, these studies could not address the topographic organization of connectivity within the EC, possibly due to limitations in resolution and SNR. The present results demonstrate that the enhanced resolution and sensitivity of ultra-high field fMRI can overcome these limitations and reveal fine-grained topographical patterns in connectivity. Three-dimensional plots of entorhinal connectivity preferences revealed a gradient of decreasing PRC and increasing PHC connectivity running from anterior-lateral to posterior-medial EC. It is notable that, by training a pattern classifier on the coordinates of EC voxels that showed preferential connectivity with PRC or PHC within a subset of participants, we could reliably predict these voxels in the remaining participant. This finding indicates that the topography of neocortical connectivity within the EC is highly conserved across participants, which, in turn, could indicate fundamental functional differences between the two EC subdivisions. \n\nTwo recent fMRI studies reported evidence for task-related activation differences between lateral and medial sections of EC in humans ( ;  ). Schultz and colleagues (2012) reported differential activation in medial and lateral sections of EC during scene and face processing in a working memory task. Reagh and Yassa reported preferential activation in a medial section of EC during mnemonic discrimination of spatial locations and preferential activation in a lateral section of EC during mnemonic discrimination of objects. This functional dissociation was observed by splitting the EC into equally-sized lateral and medial parts according to the rodent terminology of \u2018LEC\u2019 and \u2018MEC\u2019. Notably, they also found a trend towards a dissociation between anterior and posterior EC after a similar equal division along the longitudinal axis. Our data help to explain these findings by empirically demonstrating that al-EC and pm-EC exhibit differential functional connectivity with PRC and PHC. Numerous fMRI studies have shown that PHC is preferentially engaged in memory tasks that involve scenes, spatial or context information, whereas PRC is preferentially engaged in memory tasks that involve object or item information (see  ;  ; for review). Thus, it makes sense that EC subregions that interact predominantly with PRC or PHC also differentially participate in item and context processing. However, our data also suggest that a simple lateral-medial distinction does not capture the functional organization of EC. Future fMRI studies (as well as structural MRI studies, e.g.,  ) could more effectively study the EC by using the high-consistency pm-EC and al-EC masks derived from our data (see also \u2018Landmarks for delineation of al-EC and pm-EC\u2019), or by using functional connectivity metrics to identify subject-specific EC subregions. \n\nConcurrent with our investigation, Navarro Schr\u00f6der and colleagues ( ) also studied the functional organization of the human EC. Whereas the present study focused on MTL connectivity, their study focused on functional connectivity of the EC with large-scale cortical networks. Consistent with our study, they also differentiated between anterior-lateral and posterior-medial EC subregions based on differential global network connectivity in resting state and task fMRI data ( ). They found that the al-EC exhibited stronger connectivity with regions in an anterior-temporal cortical system including medial-prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, whereas the pm-EC exhibited stronger connectivity with regions in a posterior-medial system including regions in occipital and posterior-parietal cortex. Analyses of task fMRI data revealed that al-EC activity was enhanced during processing of object information and pm-EC activity was enhanced during processing of scenes. Their findings are consistent with the idea that al- and pm-EC may be related to two cortico-hippocampal networks that support distinct types of memory ( ;  ). \n\nAlthough the EC is a major gateway for the hippocampus, neocortical regions such as PRC and PHC also have direct reciprocal connectivity with CA1 and subiculum ( ,  ;  ). Our analyses revealed that the topographic differences in subicular connectivity with PRC vs PHC along the hippocampal transverse axis paralleled the differences of subicular connectivity with al-EC vs pm-EC. Whereas al-EC and PRC showed stronger connectivity with proximal subiculum, pm-EC and PHC showed stronger connectivity with distal subiculum. In contrast to the transverse axis, PRC/PHC vs al-EC/pm-EC connectivity profiles differed along the longitudinal hippocampal axis. For al-EC and pm-EC, there was no evidence or trend for an anterior-posterior dissociation, compatible with connectivity of LEC and MEC in rodents ( ,  ;  ;  ). In contrast, the most anterior subiculum showed stronger connectivity with PRC than PHC, whereas in one data set the most posterior subiculum (in the hippocampal body [HB]) showed stronger connectivity with PHC than PRC. This finding replicated the direct anatomical connectivity profiles observed in rodents ( ,  ;  ). Such an anterior-posterior dissociation of hippocampal connectivity accords with findings from human resting-state fMRI studies that investigated functional connectivity profiles of PRC and PHC (rather than EC) with hippocampal subfields ( ). \n\nThese functional connectivity data suggest that there might be two parallel cortico-hippocampal pathways in humans\u00a0\u2014 one via the EC and one that is direct. The differences in the topographic organization of EC-subicular connectivity and PRC/PHC-subicular connectivity could have important functional implications. One implication is that the EC is not a simple anatomical extension of the PRC and PHC. If that were the case, we would not have observed any reliable difference between neocortical-hippocampal connectivity profiles and EC-hippocampal connectivity profiles. These results add support to the notion that the EC is more than a mere cortico-hippocampal relay (e.g.,  ;  ). One possibility is that this organization might allow a comparison between EC-gated hippocampal memory signals with direct neocortical input (e.g.,  ). Furthermore, the diffuse nature of LEC/MEC projections along the anterior-posterior hippocampal axis and a structured gradient of direct PRC/POR projections that has been identified in rodents could allow for integration of information across both processing streams ( ;  ;  ). \n\nResults from the present study may be pertinent to understanding memory impairment in clinical conditions that compromise the structural integrity of the medial temporal lobes, including neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, temporal lobe epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, developmental amnesia and ischemia. In AD, for instance, tau pathology emerges in lateral regions of the EC early in the course of the disease ( ;  ). Analyses of functional connectivity can potentially reveal how EC degeneration in the early stages of AD could impact the functional organization of distributed cortical networks ( ; also see;  ) and also shed light on the transsynaptic progression of pathology in AD. \n\nTo summarize, the results of the present study provide a detailed description of the organization of functional connectivity within the human EC. Based on differential functional connectivity with PRC, PHC and subicular subregions, our data, along with those of Navarro Schr\u00f6der et al. (in review), demonstrate that the human EC can be reliably subdivided into anterior-lateral and posterior-medial subregions that could be critical nodes in two cortico-hippocampal processing pathways. Future studies can apply the high resolution functional connectivity analyses to differentiate the roles of al-EC and pm-EC in memory and alterations of EC connectivity in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwo independent samples of 21 and 22 young, healthy subjects underwent high resolution fMRI scanning (Exp. 1: mean age 26 \u00b1 3.6 yrs, 12 male; Exp. 2: mean age 28 \u00b1 3.9 yrs, 7 male). Exclusion criteria were metallic implants (other than standard dental implants), tinnitus, known metabolic disorders or a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. Both studies were approved by the local ethics committee of the University Magdeburg. All subjects gave written informed consent and consent to publish prior to participation and received monetary compensation for participation. Six subjects from Experiment 1 and six from Experiment 2 were excluded due to strong dropouts in the PRC and/or EC or due to severe movement artifacts. Functional connectivity analyses were performed on the residuals of task data after extraction of task effects (N  = 15, N  = 14). \n\n\n### Tasks \n  \n#### Experiment 1 (encoding of novel vs familiar images of scenes) \n  \nDuring the fMRI session, subjects performed an incidental visual encoding paradigm. In 1 run, 120 new images (60 indoor and 60 outdoor), 60 \u2018noise\u2019 images and 60 repetitions of one familiar image were presented randomly. The familiar image and the \u2018noise\u2019 images were familiarized using 10 repetitions each directly before the functional MR scan. Subjects made an indoor/outdoor judgment for each image by button press (for more details, see  ). \n\n\n#### Experiment 2 (Differentiation of original images and similar lures) \n  \nDuring fMRI data acquisition subjects performed an explicit mnemonic discrimination task. Stimuli were presented in short sequences consisting of 3\u20135 stimulus presentations of the same two stimuli (two similar versions of the same indoor scene). Sequences were presented in an event-related design. Each stimulus was presented for 3 s and stimuli were separated by a presentation of a scrambled noise picture for 3.5 s to prevent after-image or pop-out effects. Sequences were separated by a presentation of a fixation star for 4 s. Subjects had to keep the first stimulus of each sequence (target) in mind and indicate the third presentation of this exact stimulus via button press with their right index finger. \n\n\n\n### Data acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nMRI data were acquired using a 7T MR system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). A 32-channel head coil was used (Nova Medical, Willmington, MA). First, a high-resolution whole head MPRAGE volume (TE = 2.8 ms, TR = 2500 ms, TI = 1050 ms, flip angle = 5\u00b0, resolution 0.6 mm isotropic) was acquired. \n\nSubsequently, the fMRI session was run. T2*-weighted gradient echo planar images (EPIs) were acquired with an isotropic resolution of 0.8 mm (28 axial slices, TE = 22 ms, TR = 2000 ms, FOV 205 mm, matrix 256 \u00d7 256, partial Fourier 5/8, parallel imaging with grappa factor 4, bandwidth 1028 Hz/Px, echo spacing 1.1 ms, echo train length 40, flip angle 90\u00b0). The slices were acquired in an odd\u2013even interleaved fashion oriented parallel to the hippocampus long axis. The fMRI session comprised 1 run (13 min) with 370 EPI volumes in Experiment 1 and 4 runs (13.5 min each) with 400 EPI volumes in Experiment 2. EPIs were distortion corrected using a point spread function mapping method ( ) and motion corrected during the online reconstruction. \n\nFinally, a high-resolution partial structural volume was acquired (T2*-weighted imaging, TE = 18.5 ms, TR = 680 ms, resolution 0.33 mm \u00d7 0.33 mm, 45 slices, slice thickness 1.5 mm + 25% gap, FOV 212 mm \u00d7 179 mm, matrix 640 \u00d7 540), with a slice alignment orthogonal to the hippocampus main axis. \n\nTotal MRI duration was around 60 min in Experiment 1 and 100 min in Experiment 2. \n\nFMRI data pre-processing and statistical modeling was done in SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College, London, UK). The pre-processing included slice timing correction and smoothing with a 1.5 mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel (FWHM < 2 \u00d7 voxel size) to keep high anatomical specificity. Outliers in average intensity and/or scan-to-scan motion were identified using the   ARTRepair toolbox   for SPM (Percent threshold in global intensity: 1.3, movement threshold: 0.3 mm/TR) and included as spike regressors. \n\nTo remove task effects, general linear models were run (including all task conditions and the movement parameters) and the residual images were saved for subsequent intrinsic functional connectivity analyses. Based on previous studies suggesting a linear superposition of task activity and spontaneous BOLD fluctuations, removing task-induced variance of event-related fMRI data should yield a remaining residual signal similar to \u2018continuous\u2019 resting state data (e.g.,  ). Although quantitative differences between residuals derived from task data and continuous resting state data have been reported ( ), in qualitative terms, patterns of functionally connected regions have been shown to be remarkably consistent ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Segmentation of regions of interest \n  \nIn order to analyze PRC vs PHC seed-to-voxel connectivity, we manually segmented PRC and PHC regions of interest (ROIs) for each subject on the individual high resolution MPRAGEs (which had been bias-corrected and coregistered to the individual mean EPIs). Furthermore, the EC and the subiculum were labelled on the T1-group template in order to analyze PRC vs PHC connectivity topography within the EC and al-EC vs pm-EC as well as PRC vs PHC connectivity topography within the subiculum, respectively, at group level (individual beta-maps were registered to the template). ROIs were traced on consecutive coronal slices bilaterally using MRIcron (Chris Rorden, Version 4 April 2011). \n\nTracing of the EC started anteriorly at the first slice where the amygdala was visible. Caudally the EC moves along the parahippocampal gyrus until the collateral sulcus disappeared ( ), typically at the level where also the HH ends, merging into the PHC. At anterior levels, the EC borders the amygdala nuclei medially ( ). When the gyrus ambiens disappears and the hippocampal fissure opens, the EC borders the parasubiculum medially. This EC-subiculum boundary was located at the angle formed by the most medial extent of both subiculum and EC ( ). The opening of the collateral sulcus typically coincides with the lateral border of the EC ( ), and was chosen as lateral limit. The PRC, which laterally abuts the EC, was defined as the region between the medial and lateral edges of the collateral sulcus (covering medial and lateral banks). Contrary to other markings schemes for the EC and PRC ( ), we did not mark the part of the EC within medial banks of the collateral sulcus that depends on the depth of the collateral sulcus, since this border shows remarkable within and between subject variability and is also sometimes difficult to identify due to partially occurring susceptibility artefacts. For the purpose of the current study, we further deleted PRC mask voxels that were directly neighbored to the EC/PRC border (leaving a gap of approx. 2 voxels \u223c1 mm) to avoid autocorrelations between PRC seed voxels and our target EC ROI. Segmentation of the PHC started one slice after the disappearance of the collateral sulcus, directly posterior to PRC and EC (approx. at the level where the HB starts). Labeling was continued posteriorly, ending on the last slice where the inferior and superior colliculi were jointly visible. The PHC was delineated as the region between subiculum (medial border) and the deepest point of the collateral sulcus ( ). \n\nThe subiculum was labeled on the T1-template (0.8 mm isotropic resolution) in the HH and body (until the colliculi disappeared) according to the segmentation protocol of ( ). Note that we did not segment the hippocampal tail as borders were difficult to identify. For division of EC and subiculum masks into anterior-posterior and lateral-medial or proximal-distal subregions, see \u2018Second Level Analyses\u2019 (Univariate). \n\nSubsequently, PRC and PHC masks were coregistered and resliced to the individual mean EPI images and manually adjusted to achieve a precise overlay on the functional data. To exclude voxels susceptible to signal dropout, for each ROI, voxels with mean intensity (across timepoints) < 2 SD from the mean intensity (across voxels) in an ROI were removed from the ROI ( ). Thresholding led to the rejection of no more than 5% of voxels in any ROI. Additionally, areas of PRC were occasionally subject to distortion artifact, and these voxels were manually deleted from ROIs. These adjusted and thresholded ROIs were used as seed regions for the functional connectivity analyses. \n\nProbabilistic white matter (WM) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) masks were generated by automated segmentation (SPM8, \u2018New Segment\u2019) of the co-registered MPRAGE images and thresholded at p(tissue) > 0.95. \n\n\n### First-level functional connectivity analyses \n  \nWe performed seed-to-voxel correlational analyses on the native (preprocessed, unnormalized) residual fMRI data using the   conn-toolbox   ( ). First, functional connectivity patterns of PRC vs PHC seeds with the EC were analyzed. For each functional connectivity analysis, seed regions' average time series were generated as regressors of interest. As covariates of no interest, WM and CSF time series and subjects' realignment parameters (including spike regressors) were included to account for physiological noise and movements, respectively. Functional data were band-pass filtered for frequencies of 0.01\u20130.1 Hz. Bivariate correlations were computed, resulting in beta maps containing Fisher-transformed correlation coefficients. To perform group analyses, beta maps were registered to the group-specific T1 template (see below) and Z-standardized. \n\n\n### Cross-participant alignment for group analyses \n  \nIn order to enable precise cross-participant alignment for hippocampal and parahippocampal regions, we used Region of Interest-Advanced Normalization Tools (ROI-ANTS [ ;  ;  ]). \n\nFirst, the Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB) software library (FSL 5.0.6 [ ]) was used to register each single participant's structural MPRAGE and the mean functional EPI using epi_reg, a command-line program that belongs to the FMRIB's linear registration tool (FLIRT v6.0 [ ]) and was specifically written to register EPI images to structural images. \n\nSecond, a study-specific template was created (from individual MPRAGE images of Exp. 1) using the buildtemplateparallel.sh command-line script within ROI-ANTS (Cross-Correlation similarity metric [ ]). Although the resulting alignment parameters already allow for a good registration to the template, we further improved normalization for the MTL regions by adding landmarks to the template. Therefore, the HH (on the first slice on which it appears), EC (on the first four consecutive slices, starting on the HH slice), the HB and the PHC (same slices as HB) were labeled on the T1-template as landmarks for the subsequent label-guided alignment. Similarly, subject-specific ROIs were drawn on the individual MPRAGEs to match the template priors. \n\nThird, the expectation-based point set registration (\u2018pse\u2019; step size: SyN[0.5]) was used to register the individual MPRAGEs on the T1-template based on the labeled points sets (= MTL masks). The resulting transformation matrix was then applied to each participant's beta map as well as to the MTL masks in order to verify alignment precision. Finally, the aligned beta images were submitted to second-level group analyses. \n\n\n### Second-level analyses \n  \n#### Univariate \n  \nFirst, we calculated single-seed group connectivity maps using voxelwise one-sample t-tests to characterize the intrinsic connectivity profiles of PHC and PRC with EC (  and  ). Additionally, paired t-tests were performed to determine significant differences in PRC vs PHC connectivity ( ). Resulting t-maps were masked with the EC ROI and significant clusters determined by cluster-extent based thresholding (Z > 2.3; p  < 0.05). In addition, we visualized the differential topographic pattern of PRC vs PHC connectivity along the x-y-z direction in three-dimensional plot of connectivity preference for each voxel (see  ). These analyses indicated relatively stronger connectivity of the PRC with the anterior-ventral-lateral EC and stronger connectivity of the PHC with the posterior-dorsal-medial EC. \n\nIn a next step, to directly test for significant differences between anterior/posterior and lateral/medial regions of the EC, we divided the template EC ROI into four equally-sized sections along the longitudinal and horizontal (or transverse) plane, corresponding to coronal and sagittal cuts, respectively. As mentioned previously, the planes are defined in reference to the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus (which also corresponds to the EC long-axis). The lateral vs medial division was performed for each coronal slice individually in order to ensure equally-sized portions along the longitudinal axis. Mean parameter estimates were extracted from each of the four subsections for each subject (from the group-registered beta maps). The resulting PRC and PHC connectivity estimates were submitted to a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 repeated-measures ANOVA with seed ROI (PHC vs PRC), longitudinal EC section (anterior vs posterior), and horizontal EC section (lateral vs medial) as factors. Furthermore, we assessed connectivity gradients across the longitudinal and horizontal axes by plotting slice-by-slice mean parameter estimates. As the number of transverse EC slices differed along the longitudinal axis (between 5 and 11 slices), we divided each coronal EC slice into 5 equal sections and calculated mean betas for each section. The same approach was used to test for differential connectivity of EC subregions and PRC/PHC with the subiculum along the longitudinal or transverse axis. \n\n\n#### Multivariate \n  \nFinally, we used a multivariate classifier (linear CSVMC) to further investigate the reliability of the topography of PRC vs PHC preferential connectivity within the EC. A linear support vector machine classifier (Linear CSVMC,  ) was trained and tested on the x-y-z coordinates of all EC voxels across all subjects using PyMVPA 2.2.0 ( ). Independent data chunks were defined according to the individual subjects of each study. Each chunk consisted of the same amount of samples (EC voxels). For the purpose of evaluation of classification validity, a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was performed. In each of the validation steps, a linear support vector machine was trained on the data of all but one subject and tested on the remaining one. Accuracy of the validation step was calculated as the proportion of the samples (voxels) that were classified correctly (as being preferentially connected to PRC or PHC). Overall classification accuracy was defined as the mean accuracy of all validation steps across subjects. \n\nMean classifier accuracy was tested for significance using non-parametric permutation testing. Over 1000 iterations, samples (EC voxels) of the training set were randomly relabeled and tested on the testing set using the same leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme as before, generating a non-parametric null distribution. Type I error rate was set at p < 0.001 based on this null distribution ( ). Classification and permutation testing were performed separately for the left and right hemisphere and separately for Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. In order to investigate the consistency of correct classifications for each voxel, we calculated the proportion of correct classifications for each voxel across subjects. Voxels with high consistency are often correctly classified across subjects whereas voxels with low consistency are rarely classified correctly. \n\n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: tbl1\n### Label: Table 1.\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tCluster\tCluster\tCluster\tPeak\tPeak coordinate (template)\tPeak coordinate (template)\tPeak coordinate (template)\tSide\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tPFWE-corr\tPFDR-corr\tSize\tZ-score\tx\ty\tz\tSide\nExperiment 1\tExperiment 1\tExperiment 1\tExperiment 1\tExperiment 1\tExperiment 1\tExperiment 1\tExperiment 1\tExperiment 1\nPRC seed\t<0.001\t<0.001\t517\t5.05\t153\t149\t8\tR\nPRC seed\t<0.001\t<0.001\t273\t4.82\t108\t146\t12\tL\nPHC seed\t<0.001\t<0.001\t380\t5.29\t150\t129\t9\tR\nPHC seed\t<0.001\t<0.001\t510\t5.05\t106\t138\t12\tL\nPRC > PHC\t0.038\t0.022\t42\t4.31\t151\t150\t8\tR\nPRC > PHC\t0.001\t0.001\t91\t4.04\t101\t146\t9\tL\nPHC > PRC\t0.008\t0.005\t61\t4.15\t150\t131\t10\tR\nPHC > PRC\t0.001\t0.002\t87\t3.53\t108\t136\t11\tL\nExperiment 2\tExperiment 2\tExperiment 2\tExperiment 2\tExperiment 2\tExperiment 2\tExperiment 2\tExperiment 2\tExperiment 2\nPRC seed\t<0.001\t<0.001\t777\t4.82\t109\t152\t20\tL\nPRC seed\t<0.001\t<0.001\t849\t4.73\t149\t145\t10\tR\nPHC seed\t<0.001\t<0.001\t669\t5.31\t147\t137\t13\tR\nPHC seed\t<0.001\t<0.001\t637\t4.91\t107\t139\t14\tL\nPRC > PHC\t<0.001\t<0.001\t167\t4.70\t105\t153\t15\tL\nPHC > PRC\t0.022\t0.024\t66\t4.09\t153\t130\t9\tR\nPHC > PRC\t0.047\t0.026\t53\t3.74\t108\t136\t18\tL\n### Caption\nUnivariate group-results for seed-to-voxel connectivity of PRC and PHC seeds with the ECDOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06426.005\n### Footer\nEntorhinal subregions showing significant functional connectivity (one-sample t-test) or differential connectivity (paired t-test) with bilateral PRC or PHC seeds (Z > 2.3, pcluster <0.05, NExp. 1 = 15, NExp. 2 = 14).

Recent findings suggest that the LC plays an important role in focusing processing on salient or goal-relevant information from multiple incoming sensory inputs (Mather et al.,  ). We hypothesized that the connection between LC and the salience network declines in older adults, and therefore the salience network fails to appropriately filter out irrelevant sensory signals. To examine this possibility, we used resting-state-like fMRI data, in which all task-related activities were regressed out (Fair et al.,  ; Elliott et al.,  ) and performed a functional connectivity analysis based on the time-course of LC activity. Older adults showed reduced functional connectivity between the LC and salience network compared with younger adults. Additionally, the salience network was relatively more coupled with the frontoparietal network than the default-mode network in older adults compared with younger adults, even though all task-related activities were regressed out. Together, these findings suggest that reduced interactions between LC and the salience network impairs the ability to prioritize the importance of incoming events, and in turn, the salience network fails to initiate network switching (e.g., Menon and Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ) that would promote further attentional processing. A chronic lack of functional connection between LC and salience network may limit older adults\u2019 attentional and executive control resources. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nStudies have suggested that attentional control deficits in older adults are due to age-related changes of the frontal system, particularly the frontoparietal network, composed of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and anterior/inferior parietal lobule (Gazzaley et al.,  ; Campbell et al.,  ;  ), such that older adults typically show reduced activation in the frontoparietal network compared with younger adults (Ferreira and Busatto,  ; Geerligs et al.,  ; Grady et al.,  ). As a result, older adults become more prone to distraction (Gazzaley et al.,  ; Schmitz et al.,  ,  ; Lee et al.,  ) and this increased distractibility is linked to the general cognitive and emotional declines observed in older adults (Hasher and Zacks,  ; Verhaeghen and Cerella,  ; Whalley et al.,  ; Yerys et al.,  ; Wadlinger and Isaacowitz,  ;  ). \n\nThe critical role of the frontoparietal network in the maintenance of attentional focus and execution (Corbetta and Shulman,  ; Petersen and Posner,  ; Scolari et al.,  ) and its age-related declines (Gazzaley et al.,  ; Schmitz et al.,  ,  ; Lee et al.,  ) has been investigated extensively by examining frontoparietal network activity. However, examining the frontoparietal network in isolation may miss important aspects of age differences in the functional circuitry of attention, as many human imaging studies and theoretical models have posited that attentional processes require large-scale brain-systems-level interactions between intrinsic neural networks (Menon and Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ). That is, attentional processing does not result from the activity of one single network alone. In particular, neuroimaging research suggests that the default mode network, including the medial PFC (MPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and precuneus, the salience network, which includes the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, and the frontoparietal network each are involved in implementing attentional processes in the brain, and also that they interact with each other. Converging evidence indicates that the salience network helps initiate frontoparietal network control of attentional processing for prioritized input (Seeley et al.,  ; Goulden et al.,  ). Thus, from a theoretical perspective, when the salience network does not filter out incoming sensory inputs appropriately and continues to activate the frontoparietal network for every sensory signal, it may lead to unnecessary depletion of limited neural resources and impairment of focused, goal-directed attentional processes. Consistent with this possibility, deficits in the salience network (e.g., decreased neural activation and connectivity between local regions within the network) are associated with attention deficits in both younger and aging adults (Lopez-Larson et al.,  ; Song et al.,  ; Cai et al.,  ; Zhao et al.,  ). \n\nHowever, the underlying neural mechanisms involved in attention deficits in the brain are still largely unclear. As discussed above, some evidence suggests that attention deficits are due to a failure of the salience network in prioritizing incoming sensory inputs at the initial stage (Lopez-Larson et al.,  ; Song et al.,  ; Cai et al.,  ; Zhao et al.,  ), whereas other evidence indicates that impaired processing efficiency within the frontoparietal network   per se   reduces the maintenance of attentional focus and execution (Zhou et al.,  ; Campbell et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ). That is, it is not clear whether increased age-related distractibility is due to a failure of ignoring distractors (i.e., salience errors) or maintaining concentration on a task (i.e., execution errors). \n\nIn this context, we note that several studies have highlighted the role of the locus coeruleus (LC), a small nucleus in the brainstem that constitutes the major source of norepinephrine (NE), in determining processing selectivity in the brain. LC releases NE to almost the entire brain throughout its widespread efferent projections, namely the LC-NE system (Foote et al.,  ; Aston-Jones and Cohen,  ; Bouret and Sara,  ; Sara,  ). The neural activity patterns of the LC-NE system, between tonic and phasic responses, determine changes in large-scale neural network configurations (Zerbi et al.,  ) to bias neural processing selectively towards goal-relevant events (Mather and Harley,  ; Mather et al.,  ). Recent fMRI studies have demonstrated that attentional selectivity tends to be less pronounced when the LC responds to external events indiscriminately (Lee et al.,  ; Clewett et al.,  ). This reduced specificity of LC responses may induce the loss of attentional focus in older adults, regardless of the saliency level of incoming sensory signals (Lee et al.,  ). \n\nNeurobiological studies indicate that the salience network provides input to the LC-NE system (Ullsperger et al.,  ; Unsworth and Robison,  ; Zerbi et al.,  ), suggesting that communication between the salience network and LC-NE system is involved in prioritizing sensory events. Neurobiological and theoretical models support this view by showing that the LC-NE system has a reciprocal connection with the salience network, which in turn may increase the selectivity of attentional processes shaped by the salience network (Jodo et al.,  ; Rajkowski et al.,  ; Markovic et al.,  ; Mather and Harley,  ). Consistent with this influence of the LC, the salience network shows decreased activity when LC-NE system activity is attenuated by the   \u03b2  -adrenoreceptor blockade (Hermans et al.,  ). Given the involvement of the LC in salience network processes, it is possible that increases in age-related distractibility are partially due to diminished neural connectivity between the salience network and the LC-NE system, which in turn means the salience network cannot prioritize important information from among multiple events to appropriately activate the frontoparietal network. However, to date, the potential connection between the LC-NE system and salience networks that may be linked to increased attentional distractibility in older adults has not been fully investigated. \n\nIn the current study, we examined age-related differences between LC and salience network connectivity. We hypothesized that the functional connections between the LC and the salience network decline in older adults (hypothesis 1). As a result, even in the absence of task demands, the salience network continuously and indiscriminately switches from the task-negative network to the frontoparietal network (Menon and Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ; hypothesis 2). To test these possibilities, we focused on the functional connectivity between the LC and salience network as a function of age group (younger vs. older adults) by using a pre-existing fMRI dataset (Lee et al.,  ). Given that this public data is task-based, we adopted a resting-state-like fMRI approach, in which all task-related activities were regressed out. Thus, our analyses can be more focused on the native and intrinsic connectivity between regions, without the influence of task-related signal fluctuations (Fair et al.,  ; Elliott et al.,  ). \n\n\n## Procedure and Methods \n  \n### Open fMRI Dataset and Preprocessing \n  \nThe dataset used in the current study, from the open-fMRI repository , consists of 28 healthy younger adults (YA: M  = 24.39 years, age range = 18\u201334; nine females) and 24 healthy older adults (OA: M  = 66.95 years, age range = 55\u201375; nine females). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of intellectual ability, as measured by either education or the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (Wechsler,  ):   M  : YA = 16.85 vs. OA = 16.38 years;   M  : YA = 43.96/50 vs. OA = 39.75/50. \n\nWe used high-resolution structural images for our analyses (MPRAGE; TR = 1,950 ms; TE = 2.26 ms; FA = 7\u00b0; 1-mm isotropic voxel; FOV = 256 mm) and five identical task runs of the dataset (142 volumes for each EPI; 41 interleaved 4-mm slices with no gap; TR = 2,000 ms; TE = 25 ms; FA = 90\u00b0; matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64; FOV = 256), in which participants were exposed to different levels of auditory and visual stimuli in terms of emotional arousal and saliency (Lee et al.,  ). The images were acquired on a Siemens 3T Magnetom Trio with a 32-channel matrix. Preprocessing was performed using the FMRIB software library (FSL ) including skull stripping and tissue mask segmentation (CSF/WM/GM) of structural images after bias-field correction; first three volumes cut, motion correction, smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 6 mm slice-timing correction, grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D data set, ICA denoising using ICA-AROMA , and 0.001\u20130.08 Hz linear-trends filtering and regressing out CSF/WM signal. To examine intrinsic functional connectivity unrelated to task-induced activity, all task-related activities were also regressed out (Fair et al.,  ; Elliott et al.,  ). For details of the task-activity related connectivity analysis and the task itself, please see the previous work (Lee et al.,  ). Finally, the preprocessed resting-state-like fMRI data were transformed to standard MNI 2-mm brain through the non-linear transformation matrix of structure-to-standard-brain using the Advanced Normalization Tool library (ANTs ). \n\nThrough the preprocessing, we identified that one of the OA participant\u2019s data was contaminated by severe motion across runs (mean framewise displacement, FD, and DVAR were 0.57 mm and 63.36, respectively). Because the severe motion can significantly reduce the estimation reliability of the functional connectivity (Power et al.,  ), we excluded this participant\u2019s data from further analysis (final data   N   = 51; mean FD and DVAR were 0.054 mm and 12.45, respectively). \n\n\n### Whole-Brain Functional Connectivity Analysis With LC Seed \n  \nBased on our hypothesis, we focused on the functional connectivity between LC and salience networks and ran a whole-brain functional connectivity analysis. To this end, we first extracted the mean time-series of LC activity from the preprocessed and task-activity-free fMRI data using a standard structural LC mask (Edlow et al.,  ). Using this LC time course, a multiple regression analysis was performed to estimate individual lower-level functional connectivity maps (i.e., seed correlation map) for each fMRI run using FSL FEAT. Then, a second-level fixed-effects analysis was performed across each participant\u2019s functional runs. Finally, individual-level LC seed connectivity maps were inputted into group-level analysis of mixed effects using cluster correction (FLAME 1 + 2;   Z   > 2.57;   corrected   P   = 0.05) with two between-group contrasts (YA > OA) and (YA < OA). \n\n\n### Connectivity Network ROI Analysis With Salience Network Seed \n  \nAn additional network-ROI analysis was conducted to examine how the salience network may be coupled with the frontoparietal network natively beyond the influence of task-related activities. To this end, from the group-level LC seed-based analysis (see  ), we selected significant voxels showing age group differences within the previously identified meta-analysis salience network template (intrinsic network mask #4 in Laird et al.,  ), and extracted mean time course of activity of those voxels (salience network seed). The aforementioned connectivity estimation procedure was repeated for each individual and we extracted connectivity parameter estimates from the frontoparietal and default-mode masks (Smith et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ) as an index of the salience connectivity strength between these two networks. \n  \nLocus coeruleus (LC)-seed based whole-brain functional connectivity results. Voxels that showed stronger connectivity with the LC for   (A)   younger adults than older adults (spatial cross-correlation of 0.345 with predetermined salience network maps: Smith et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ) and   (B)   vice versa. \n  \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWhole-Brain connectivity analysis of the LC between age groups showed that, compared to YA, OA exhibited significantly reduced functional connectivity of the LC with the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and putamen ( ). These regions are considered to be the core of the salience network (Menon and Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ). To confirm that these regions showed reduced functional connectivity in OA constitute the salience network, additional spatial cross-correlation analysis with the previously defined salience network template (i.e., intrinsic network mask #4 in Laird et al.,  ) was performed and it showed a high degree of similarity (  r   > 0.358). This result indicates that the LC is connected to the salience network more strongly in YA than OA, suggesting that the salience network activity is coupled strongly with LC activity in YA but not in OA ( ;  ). Also, OA showed more connectivity of the LC with initial visual processing regions, including the fusiform gyrus extended from occipital to temporal regions, the lingual gyrus and the inferior temporal gyrus ( ;  ). \n  \nBrain regions within significant clusters on the LC seed-based whole-brain connectivity analysis between younger adults (YA) and older adults (OA). \n  \n Please note the reported region labels are the peak value locations within the Harvard-Oxford structure atlas on each cluster (H = hemisphere; Z = z-value)  . \n  \nDue to the reduced LC and salience network connectivity in OA, we hypothesized that the OA\u2019s salience network could not differentiate between important and unimportant sensory inputs and that it might continuously switch the network configuration from the default-mode network to the frontoparietal network based on the previous model of how the salience network coordinates network switching (Menon and Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ). To test this hypothesis, we extracted connectivity parameter estimates from the previously defined frontoparietal and default-mode masks (Smith et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ) as an index of the salience connectivity strength between these two networks, from the salience network seed-based connectivity maps for each age group (see \u201cConnectivity Network-ROI Analysis With Salience Network Seed\u201d section). We found that the salience network was more coupled with the frontoparietal network in OA than YA, even though all task-related activities were initially regressed out. Conversely, OA\u2019s salience network was less coupled with the default-mode network than in YA participants. This pattern was confirmed by a between-network condition (2: salience-frontoparietal, salience-default) and aging group (2: OA, YA) repeated-measures ANOVA, which revealed a significant cross-over interaction,   F   = 6.135,   p   = 0.017, partial-  = 0.111, and a main effect of between-network condition,   F   = 6.215,   p   = 0.016, partial   = 0.113 ( ). That is, despite all task-related activities having been regressed out before the connectivity analyses, the OA\u2019s salience network is still excessively coupled with the task-positive network compared to YA and the task-negative network. \n  \nROI results for salience network seed-based functional connectivity analysis showing the salience network couplings with frontoparietal and default networks as a function of aging group. Error bars denote the standard error term. *  P   < 0.05. \n  \nAdditional correlation analyses were performed to see the relationship between age and each connectivity strength (i.e., LC-SN, SN-DMN, SN-FPN). As a result, we found that there was a significant negative relationship between the LC-SN connectivity strength and age overall,   r   = \u22120.511,   p   < 0.001, suggesting that the LC-SN connectivity decreased with age ( ). For the groups separately, YA\u2019 age showed a significant positive correlation with the connectivity strength,   r   = 0.377,   p   < 0.05, but OA did not show such relationship,   r   = \u22120.131,   p   = 0.550. We additionally compared the correlation coefficients between age groups, and found there was a marginally significant difference,   z   = \u22121.76,   p   = 0.078. In the SN-FPN, there was a significant relationship between the connectivity strength and age overall,   r   = 0.276,   p   = 0.05, indicating that the increased SN-FPN connectivity, even in the absence of attentional demands (i.e., resting state), was associated with age ( ). On their own, neither YA and OA showed significant relationships between age and connectivity strength,   r  s < \u00b1 0.09,   p  s > 0.662, and no difference between correlation coefficients between groups,   z   = \u22120.52,   p   = 0.603. In the SN-DMN, there was a marginally significant relationship between the age and connectivity strength,   r   = \u22120.243,   p   = 0.086, showing that there is a linear trend toward a decrease in the SN-DMN connection with age ( ). For each group separately, neither YA and OA showed significant relationships between age and connectivity strength,   r  s < \u00b1 0.11,   p  s > 0.635, and no difference between group coefficients,   z   = 0.59,   p   = 0.552. In sum, these correlational results were consistent with the main findings that showed age-related mean differences of connectivity between intrinsic networks and regions. \n  \nScatter plot illustrating the relationship between   (A)   LC-SN,   (B)   SN-FPN, and   (C)   SN-DMN connectivity and across age for across range (green), YA only (blue) and OA only (orange). **  P   < 0.001; *  P   < 0.05; n.s., non-significant. \n  \n\n## Discussion \n  \nIt is impossible to process every stimulus around us simultaneously at any given moment. Thus, we need to select what is important from our surroundings, and focus mental resources on those selected for sufficient periods of time to be able to process them (Treisman,  ; Carrasco,  ; Wolfe and Horowitz,  ). However, this attentional control ability declines with age, and older adults appear more susceptible to distraction and interference compared to their younger counterparts. These declines have been demonstrated through an extensive body of behavioral research (Madden et al.,  ; West and Alain,  ; Verhaeghen and Cerella,  ; Healey et al.,  ); subsequent imaging work has established decreases in the responsiveness of neural attentional control resources in older adults as well (Milham et al.,  ). Eventually, this increased distractibility in older adults is associated with more general cognitive and emotional declines, although perspectives differ on the fundamental nature of these issues (Hasher and Zacks,  ; Verhaeghen and Cerella,  ; Whalley et al.,  ; Yerys et al.,  ; Wadlinger and Isaacowitz,  ;  ). Some of this work includes convergent evidence from working memory research that specifically explores the effects of distraction in older adults (e.g., Chadick et al.,  ); we note that one recent review article proposes an LC-NE specific account of differences in performance in both working memory and attentional control (Unsworth and Robison,  ). However, despite work that confirms both the behavioral and neural implications of declines in attentional control, our understanding of the fundamental underlying neural mechanisms of how and why older adults are prone to distraction remains somewhat incomplete. Dysregulation in LC-NE function remains one compelling, but largely unexplored, explanation for non-optimal frontoparietal network activity during aging. \n\nIn the present study, we examined age-related functional connectivity differences based on LC activity to provide insight into attentional deficits in older adults. In particular, we used a pre-existing task-based fMRI dataset that has exhibited task-based age deficits in attentional processing. Given the original findings from the dataset (Lee et al.,  ), we wanted to examine the intrinsic brain activity beyond task-based signal changes. A growing body of evidence suggests that the intrinsic brain activity (i.e., background neural signal fluctuation) plays a primary role in shaping task-based brain activity (Cole et al.,  ,  ; Bzdok et al.,  ; Tavor et al.,  ). Using the intrinsic network extracted from the task-based fMRI is a useful approach to investigate the neural basis of task-evoked activity (Arfanakis et al.,  ; Fair et al.,  ; Elliott et al.,  ). \n\nWe found that older adults showed relatively reduced functional connectivity between the LC and the salience network compared with younger adults such that the signal fluctuation of the LC is coupled to the signal fluctuation of the salience network less in older adults than in younger adults. Instead, the LC showed stronger connectivity with visual processing regions, and the salience network was more coupled with the frontoparietal network compared to the default mode network, in older adults than younger adults, even though all task-related activities were regressed out. Together, these findings suggest that the interaction between LC the salience network fails to prioritize the importance of incoming events due to reduced functional connectivity, and in turn, the frontoparietal network is recruited continuously (e.g., Menon and Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ) even when it is unnecessary. This unnecessary coupling with the frontoparietal network, without differential priority for incoming events, may be the main source that limits older adults\u2019 resources, inducing difficulty with sustaining attention and focusing on a specific task. \n\nIf the salience network helps to switch network configurations as suggested previously (Menon and Uddin,  ; Uddin,  ), the reduced connectivity observed here should contribute to older adults\u2019 distractibility. Due to this reduced connectivity, the salience network may not get adequate feedback from the LC in responding to sensory inputs, and thus the older adults\u2019 salience network may fail to ignore incoming, but non-important, events. This presupposes that the salience network is more likely to be influenced by the LC in computing saliency level, and biasing processing selectivity of the frontoparietal network afterward. Alternatively, the LC-NE system may achieve processing specificity from inputs of the salience network, and it directly regulates the attentional control system (Unsworth and Robison,  ). If that is indeed the case, the increased distractibility observed in older adults is more likely to be an issue of inputs from the salience network to the LC-NE system, wherein the LC may not receive priority information from the salience network, leading to the LC sending excitatory inputs indiscriminately to the entire brain, including the frontoparietal network through its efferent projection (Corbetta and Shulman,  ; Cohen et al.,  ). Unfortunately, given the correlational nature of functional connectivity analyses in human brain imaging (Joel et al.,  ), it is difficult to rule out other possible nodes through which communication between the LC and salience network activates the frontoparietal network. In any case, however, the current results suggest the importance of functional connectivity between the salience network and LC-NE system in a cascade of a focused attentional processes: the failure of functional communication between them unnecessarily depletes neural resources by increasing excessive processes even for task-incidental sensory information ( ) and inappropriate recruitment of the frontoparietal network ( ). \n\nOur findings are consistent with recent work that has established older-adults\u2019 vulnerability to distraction, showing that age-related attentional deficits are more likely to be from a failure in the early selection of important stimuli rather than an inefficient process of execution at the later stage (Schmitz et al.,  ,  ). Similarly, our previous findings demonstrated that older adults\u2019 perception   per se   did not differ from that of younger adults in that older adults showed similar levels of perceptual specificity for task stimulus types (e.g., object and house) with younger adults, but older adults were worse at inhibiting irrelevant information (Lee et al.,  ). That is, older adults have fine perceptual representations of whatever is the focus of their attention, much as younger adults, but fail to inhibit representations that should be ignored. Extending previous findings, the current study provides a possible underlying mechanism suggesting that reduced functional communication between the LC and salience network in the brain contributes to age-related attention deficits. Thus, combining neurobiological studies that can isolate long-range neural connectivity between the LC and salience network more specifically (e.g., Kim et al.,  ) will be an important future direction to better understand these brain connectivity patterns and how they may be linked to age-related attentional deficits. \n\nFinally, it is important to note that there are several limitations to our study. First, the LC is an exceptionally small structure in the brainstem, and thus it is hard to locate its location in an individual brain. Although we used the standard LC structure mask, given the low-resolution nature of EPI and the current 6-mm smoothing and MNI spatial normalization, the LC signal we extracted as a seed activity inherently includes other signals from neighboring regions within the brainstem such as periaqueductal gray (PAG) or ventral tegmental area (VTA). Therefore, in future work, it would be beneficial to utilize a neuromelanin sequence to locate individual LC location on the native space (e.g., Clewett et al.,  ) and extract a seed signal without smoothing (e.g., Alak\u00f6rkk\u00f6 et al.,  ). Second, the LC is often confounded by physio artifacts such as cardiac pulsation. In the current study, we applied the ICA-denoising process to correct physio noise in the brainstem. Although the ICA-denoising is a promising approach to mitigate physiological influence at the global level (Lee et al.,  ,  ; Clewett et al.,  ), measuring individual respiration and cardiac pulse during future scans will be helpful to estimate the LC signal, as individual-based physio noise correction can be more focal and direct to the brainstem signal fluctuation correction (Glover et al.,  ). \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw dataset can be found here:  .

To advance the localization in this area, precise functional imaging is fundamental. In this study, we used a sophisticated fMRI technique as well as physiological recordings to investigate the involvement of brainstem/midbrain nuclei in cognitive control during a Stroop task. The temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) increased due to physiological noise correction (PNC) especially in regions adjacent to arteries and cerebrospinal fluid. Within the brainstem/cerebellum template an average tSNR of 68 \u00b1 16 was achieved after the simultaneous application of a high-resolution fMRI, specialized co-registration, and PNC. The analysis of PNC data revealed an activation of the substantia nigra in the Stroop interference contrast whereas no significant results were obtained in the midbrain or brainstem when analyzing uncorrected data. Additionally, we found that pupil size indicated the level of cognitive effort. The Stroop interference effect on pupillary responses was correlated to the effect on reaction times (  R   = 0.464,   p   < 0.05). When Stroop stimuli were modulated by pupillary responses, we observed a significant activation of the LC in the Stroop interference contrast. Thus, we demonstrated the beneficial effect of PNC on data quality and statistical results when analyzing neuronal responses to a cognitive task. Parametric modulation of task events with pupillary responses improved the model of LC BOLD activations in the Stroop interference contrast. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAccumulating research has revealed the close interrelationship between the autonomic state and motivation, attention, mood, or cognition. For instance, in addition to the strong influence of cognitive strains on autonomic function, feelings in the body that are associated with emotions (somatic markers) profoundly influence our decisions ( ;  ). Thus, the internal state determines the way we react to the environment ( ). It has been assumed that behavioral states might be related closely to neuromodulatory brainstem systems. Thus, assessing the activity of the autonomic nervous system is indicative of the functional state ( ;  ). Therefore, inclusion of peripheral indicators of autonomic function is an important addendum to research in neurosciences. \n\nOne excellent example of such a close interaction is the human pupil reflecting both the autonomic state as well as cognitive demand ( ;  ). Thus, pupillometry has become a powerful tool in psychophysiology (e.g., see review by  ). Pupils have been shown to react to various types of cognitive demand, such as memory load ( ), arithmetic tests ( ), or speech processing ( ). A higher level of cognitive effort leads to a greater magnitude of pupillary reaction ( ;  ). The size of the pupil is determined by the sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow to the muscles of the iris ( ). Parasympathetic activation leads to constriction, whereas sympathetic stimulation results in dilation of the pupil. Preganglionic sympathetic neurons receive input from the posterior nuclei of the hypothalamus and project from the intermediolateral nucleus in the spinal cord through the sympathetic trunk to the iris. The Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EWN) is considered to be the primary origin of parasympathetic influence on the pupils. In addition, the locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of noradrenaline in the brain, exhibits inhibitory influences on the EWN ( ;  ;  ). Given the reported co-variation of LC firing rate and pupillary responses ( ;  ), the dilation of the pupil has been considered as a proxy of noradrenergic activity in humans ( ;  ). \n\nThe LC has been proposed to facilitate the dynamic reorganization of neural networks in response to external stimuli ( ).   highlighted its role in attention shifting and cognitive flexibility. They postulated that the LC is significantly involved in the dynamic switch between functional networks. The dorsal fronto-parietal network including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the dorsal parietal cortex is important for the selection of stimuli and generation of responses. The ventral fronto-parietal network with the temporo-parietal junction, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior insula as core regions, detects salient stimuli, interrupts and redirects attention ( ). \n\nAnother physiological marker that has been proposed to indicate mental effort is the level of skin conductance ( ;  ;  ;  ). The secretion of sweat changes the electrical properties of the skin that can be recorded superficially ( ). In competitive analyses,   and   demonstrated measures of skin conductance and pupil size to be similarly suitable for indicating mental workload.   reported the pupil size to be more accurate than skin conductance to reflect cognitive load. \n\nThe differential involvement of neurotransmitter systems in the generation of skin conductance responses (SCR) is still unclear.   showed that lesions to noradrenergic fiber bundles in cats abolish SCR and spontaneous fluctuation of skin conductance. In contrast, microinjections into the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the midbrain\u2019s dopaminergic center, had no effect on skin conductance. Neuroimaging studies reported that BOLD changes and metabolism in regions congruent to LC and VTA are related to spontaneous skin conductance fluctuations at rest ( ), and responses to fear ( ).   proposed a crucial influence of the reticular formation, a brainstem network including the LC, on skin conductance. Thus, the noradrenergic system might have a decisive role in generating SCR. \n\nRecently, we reported that the LC and VTA/Substantia nigra (SN) are significantly involved in cognitive and especially inhibitory control ( ,  ). We used the well-established   Stroop Color-Word   Test [SCWT, ( )] to investigate the neural correlates of cognitive control processes in the brainstem/midbrain. In the SCWT, participants shall name the color in which a word is presented ignoring the word itself. The color either matches the meaning of the word (congruent condition) or not (incongruent condition, IC). Incongruent trials require an inhibition of an overlearned, pre-potent response tendency (reading the word) in favor of an unusual, less pre-potent action (naming the color of the ink). We observed that BOLD activation of the LC and VTA/SN was higher in incongruent than in congruent trials. Compared to the VTA/SN, the LC was functionally connected to the dorsal fronto-parietal network. We additionally demonstrated differential activation of VTA/SN and LC modulated by demands of cognitive control. Our data gave additional evidence that phasic activation of LC facilitates cognitive conflict resolution and optimizes behavioral responses by activating specific task-related brain networks. \n\nHowever, brainstem and midbrain nuclei are small compared with the cortical regions involved in cognitive control, and are more susceptible to signal distortion and artifacts arising from local tissue interfaces and physiological noise ( ). Especially the position of the LC at the posterior border of the brainstem impedes its functional imaging. Neuromelanin-sensitive scans have added significant information on the anatomical location of the LC ( ,  ;  ) that can be used to validate the identification of LC ( ;  ;  ). Standard anatomical scans can also be used to detect activation of the LC ( ;  ). To link structures such as the LC with specific functions using fMRI, a precise match of anatomical and functional information is essential. To really advance our understanding in this field, improvement of functional data analysis is needed. \n\nIn our present study, we used the SCWT to corroborate the involvement of LC and VTA/SN in cognitive control. To further enhance image quality, we prepared our data by applying physiological noise correction (PNC) and a specialized brainstem/cerebellum normalization technique. To improve anatomical and functional distinction between brainstem and midbrain nuclei, we applied functional scans with a high spatial resolution of 1.4 mm  and assessed simultaneously physiological responses of pupils and skin conductance to indicate cognitive efforts. We assumed a close association of LC activation and pupillary dilation in the Stroop interference contrast. Therefore, we hypothesize that including pupillary responses to model BOLD activation within the LC might enhance its identification. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nFourteen healthy subjects (nine females, five males, age: 27 \u00b1 7 years) participated in this study. The following exclusion criteria were applied: any disease or impairment of the circulatory system, the peripheral nervous system or the endocrine system, alcohol- or drug abuse. Subjects with past or current neurological or psychiatric diseases according to M.I.N.I ( ) and/or first-degree relatives with Axis I psychiatric disorders were excluded from the study. None of the study participants was taking any psychopharmacological medication. \n\nThree subjects were excluded due to inadequate quality of the eye tracker signal (see below). Thus, eleven subjects were analyzed (seven males, four females, age: 28 \u00b1 7 years). All participants were German native speakers, right-handed according to the modified version of Annett\u2019s Handedness Inventory ( ). All participants gave written consent to a protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Jena in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Experimental Paradigm \n  \nParticipants conducted the manual version of the Stroop color word task ( ;  ). In brief, participants had to choose the color of the word written in the center of the projected screen. In the congruent condition, the color of the word matches its meaning. In the IC, the color word is displayed in a color, which is not denoted by the word. Subjects were instructed to indicate one of two possible answers presented at the bottom of the screen by pressing a button of the pad with the right index or middle finger. Correct answers were counterbalanced on the right and left sides of the display. In a pseudorandomized order, 18 congruent and 18 incongruent stimuli were presented for 1500 ms each, with an inter-stimulus interval of 10.5 s. Additionally, a temporal jitter was introduced to enhance the temporal resolution. \n\n\n### MRI Parameters \n  \nFunctional data was collected on a 3 T Magnetom PRISMA fit whole-body system (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 64-element receive-only head matrix coil. Head immobilization was achieved using head pads within the coil. T2 -weighted images were obtained using a gradient-echo EPI sequence (TR = 2040 ms, TE = 33 ms, flip angle = 75) with 100 contiguous transverse slices of 1.4 mm thickness and a multi-band acceleration factor of four covering the entire brain and including the lower brainstem. Matrix size was 138 \u00d7 138 pixels with in-plane resolution of (1.4 \u00d7 1.4) mm . A series of 220 whole-brain volume sets were acquired in one session. High-resolution anatomical T1-weighted volume scans (MP-RAGE) were obtained in sagittal orientation (TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.07 ms, TI = 900 ms, flip angle = 9%, FOV = 256 mm, matrix = (256 \u00d7 256) mm , number of sagittal slices = 192, with an isotropic resolution of (1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1) mm . \n\n\n### Physiological Recordings \n  \nPhotoplethysmogram (PPG), respiration and skin conductance were recorded throughout MR image acquisition at 500 Hz using an MR-compatible polygraph MP150 (BIOPAC Systems Inc., Goleta, CA, United States). Respiratory activity was assessed by a strain gage transducer incorporated in a belt that was tied around the chest, approximately at the level of the processus xiphoideus. The respiratory signal was amplified between 0.05 and 10 Hz and temporally smoothed (250 samples). The PPG sensor was attached to the proximal phalanx of the left index finger. The finger pulse signal was recorded in a frequency range of 0.05\u20133 Hz and smoothed over 50 samples. Skin conductance was measured continuously (constant voltage 1technique) at the left hand\u2019s palm with Ag/AgCl electrodes placed at the thenar and hypothenar eminence. The signal was amplified below 10 Hz, median filtered (150 samples) and smoothed (250 samples). \n\nPupillometric recordings were conducted using a MR-compatible ASL Long Range Optic Eye Tracker (Applied Science Laboratories, Bedford, MA, United States). Pupil diameter (PD) and gaze position were extracted from the video stream and sampled at 120 Hz. Artifacts and closed eyes were automatically detected by the software and replaced offline by linear interpolation of adjacent values. PD was smoothed over 100 samples. Only recordings with artificial samples less than 10% of all acquired data during the recording were analyzed (mean artifact rate of the final sample was 3.3%). Trigger output of the MR scanner was logged by the presentation software and recorded by the polygraph and the eye tracker to synchronize all the acquired data with the task paradigm. \n\n\n### Physiological Noise Correction \n  \nPrior to preprocessing, physiological fluctuations synchronized with cardiac and respiratory cycles were removed using the RETROICOR approach ( ). To account for low frequency variations in the BOLD signal through slow blood oxygenation level fluctuations, five respiration volumes per time (RVT) regressors were additionally removed ( ). The RVT regressors consisted of the RVT function and four delayed terms at 5, 10, 15, and 20 s ( ;  ), while eight low-order Fourier time series (four based on the cardiac phase and four on the respiratory phase) were created using the RETROICOR algorithm. All regressors were generated on a slice-wise basis by AFNI\u2019s RetroTS.m script implemented in MATLAB 2016b, which takes the cardiac and respiratory time series synchronized with the fMRI acquisition as input. \n\n\n### Image Data Preprocessing \n  \nFor image processing and statistical analyses, we used SPM12 . The first four images were discarded to avoid contributions from non-steady-state tissue magnetization. The remaining 216 images were corrected for differences in time acquisition by sinc-interpolation and realigned to the first image. The co-registered anatomical images were segmented using the tissue probability maps. Functional images were then spatially normalized to the MNI space using parameters estimated during the segmentation process. \n\n\n### Specialized Brainstem/Midbrain Co-registration \n  \nTo improve the image normalization at the brainstem level, data was normalized to the spatially unbiased infra-tentorial template [SUIT, version 3.1, ( )]. Using the SUIT toolbox, we applied the following preprocessing steps: (i) segmentation of the whole-brain image; (ii) cropping of the image, retaining only the cerebellum and brainstem; (iii) normalization using the DARTEL engine ( ) that uses gray and white matter segmentation maps produced during cerebellar isolation to generate a flow field using Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping ( ), and (iv) re-slicing to a voxel size of (1.5 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 1.5) mm . \n\nWhole brain and cropped data were smoothed with a Gaussian filter of 4 mm FWHM and high-pass filtered with a cutoff period of 128 s and corrected for serial correlations choosing AR (1). \n\n\n### Temporal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (tSNR) \n  \nThe quality of the data was quantified in terms of the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR). It was calculated voxel-wise as the BOLD signals temporal mean divided by its standard deviation ( ). To compare the change of quality due to PNC at the brainstem level, we calculated mean tSNR maps after standard preprocessing of corrected and uncorrected data (standard co-registration, unsmoothed). Additionally, we estimated a mean tSNR map of the data used for our analyses (with specialized co-registration, PNC and smoothing). \n\n\n### Physiological Recordings: Event-Related SCR and PDR \n  \nPhysiological responses were extracted at the onset of stimulus presentation (reference time   t   = 0) with a duration of 10 s and referenced to baseline (mean value within 1 s before stimulus onset). We averaged reactions in congruent and incongruent Stroop trials. The area under the curve (AUC) and maximum of each PD and SC reaction was estimated and compared in terms of a paired   t  -test between conditions. The AUC per subject was used as measure of the strength of PD and SCR in all further analyses. The pupillary Stroop effect was defined as percentage increases of PDR in IC compared to CC ( ). Stroop interference effect, i.e., the percentage increase of reaction times from CC to IC was correlated to the pupillary Stroop effect. \n\n\n### FMRI Statistical Data Analysis \n  \nReaction times and characteristics of physiological responses to congruent and incongruent Stroop stimuli were compared by a paired   t  -test. To assess a possible decline of physiological reactions over trials, we standardized all reactions (AUC) to the first trial and correlated these ratios to the trial number. \n\nIn   model 1  , neural responses to incongruent (IC) and congruent Stroop stimuli (CC) were modeled by convolving a series of impulses at stimulus onset times by the hemodynamic response function. The single-subject general linear model (GLM) included the regressors of CC and IC, as well as six head motion parameters estimated during image realignment. \n\nIn   model 2  , each Stroop stimulus was weighted by the evoked SCR. Therefore, SCR was added as a parametric modulator to   model 1  . Single subjects GLMs included modulated task regressors (CC and IC) and six head motion parameters as covariates. \n\nIn   model 3  , pupillary responses were used for parametric modulation of Stroop stimuli in the same manner as in   model 2  . \n\nSubject-specific parameter estimates were then entered into a second-level RFX analysis. We set up an ANOVA design with the within-subject factor TASK (CC and IC) and tested for the interference contrast IC vs. CC. All statistical maps were thresholded at the voxel-level with   p   < 0.005 (uncorrected) and cluster-level corrected with the number of expected voxels per cluster ( ). To investigate the influence of PNC,   model 1   was estimated on data corrected for physiological noise as well as uncorrected data.   Model 2   and   model 3   were estimated on PNC data. To assess an overlap between activated brainstem clusters and LC location, we used the anatomical mask image in the MNI coordinate space based on  . This mask represents the extent of peak LC signal distribution, obtained from a sample of 44 healthy adults using high-resolution T1-weighted Turbo Spin Echo MRI. \n\nWe investigated the changes of luminance due to the presentation of color words of different length and ink color. In our lab outside the scanner, we used the toolbox phyphox  (RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany) running on a Samsung Galaxy tablet to record luminance during the Stroop task. Mean luminance changes during stimulus presentation were calculated to check for a difference of luminance between task conditions. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Effect of Physiological Noise Correction on tSNR \n  \nWe detected increases of the tSNR throughout the brainstem (see   Figure   ). The improvement was most pronounced around tissue borders to cerebral spinal fluid, but also within the midbrain, brainstem and cerebellum. The tSNR of our data used for analyses was 67.8 \u00b1 15.9 on average within the SUIT template (  Figure   ). \n  \nImpact of physiological noise correction (PNC) on temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR).   (A)   Increase of tSNR due to PNC.   (B)   tSNR of the analyzed data after complete preprocessing including PNC, brainstem/cerebellum co-registration and smoothing etc. \n  \n\n### Effect of Physiological Noise Correction on Statistical Results (Stroop Interference Contrast) \n  \nWithout PNC, a cluster in the upper anterior pons showed increased activations in the incongruent compared to the congruent condition (  x   = 0,   y   = -24,   z   = -21,   t   = 3.69,   p   < 0.005,   k   = 12). Three clusters in the cerebellum also showed significant activation in the Stroop interference contrast (see   Figure    and   Table   ). \n  \nImpact of PNC on the statistical results revealed by the analysis of the Stroop interference contrast.   (A)   The analysis of uncorrected data leads to a statistical significant activation cluser in the upper pons and no midbrain/brainstem activations.   (B)   A significant activation in the substantia nigra (SN) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) was detected when analyzing PNC data. \n    \nClusters with significant BOLD activations in the Stroop interference contrast with and without physiological noise correction of underlying data. \n  \nAfter PNC, we found that three clusters in the midbrain were more activated in the incongruent than in the congruent condition (  Figure   ). One cluster most probably overlapped with the substantia nigra (SN,   x   = -6,   y   = -19,   z   = -16,   t   = 4.29,   p   < 0.005,   k   = 28) and one was situated adjacent to the aqueduct (periaqueductal gray, PAG,   x   = -7,   y   = -30,   z   = -4,   t   = 3.89,   p   < 0.005,   k   = 56). Additional activations were found in the cerebellum (see   Table   ). There was no overlap of significant clusters of uncorrected and PNC data in the Stroop interference contrast. \n\n\n### Behavioral and Physiological Reactions to the Stroop Task \n  \nSubjects responded significantly slower in incongruent (1223 \u00b1 328 ms) than in congruent trials (1036 \u00b1 216 ms,   t   = -4.16,   p   < 0.01), indicating a reliable induction of the Stroop effect. Errors and missing responses (  n   = 11) occurred in the IC only. Reaction times decreased with increasing trial number of the IC (  R   = 0.333,   p   < 0.05) and the CC (  R   = 0.349,   p   < 0.01) revealing a general learning effect. \n\nAs shown in   Figures  \u2013  , pupil diameter responses (PDR) were higher in incongruent (IC, green) than in congruent trials (CC, blue). The area under PDR was lower in the CC (1241 \u00b1 1043 n.u.) compared to the IC (2155 \u00b1 1110 n.u.,   t   = -2.24,   p   < 0.05;   Figure   ). The maximum pupil size was 1.135 \u00b1 0.038 n.u. in CC trails and 1.159 \u00b1 0.041 n.u. in IC trials (  t   = -2.45,   p   < 0.05;   Figure   ). There was a significant habituation of pupillary responses during CC (R  = 0.459,   p   < 0.01) and IC (R  = 0.223,   p   < 0.05). The pupillary Stroop effect correlated to the Stroop interference effect (R  = 0.464,   p   < 0.05). \n  \nPupillary and skin conductance reactions to the Stroop task given in normalized units (n.u.).   (A)   Mean pupil diameter reactions (PDR) during the congruent (CC, blue) and incongruent condition (IC, green), with standard deviation indicated by shaded areas.   (B)   Area under PDR during the CC (blue) and IC (green).   (C)   Maximum PDR during the CC (blue) and IC (green).   (D)   Mean skin conductance reactions in the CC (blue) and IC (green), with standard deviation indicated by shaded areas.   (E)   Area under SCR during the CC (blue) and IC (green).   (F)   Maximum SCR during the CC (blue) and IC (green).   p   < 0.05. \n  \nThere was no significant difference between SCR during the incongruent and congruent condition (  Figure   ). Similarly, the maximum, the area under SCR and the latency of SCR were not different (  Figures   ). We found no linear decrease of SCR indices over trials and no correlation to reaction times. \n\nDuring the task, luminance decreased by 2.15 \u00b1 1.45% in CC and 2.11 \u00b1 1.44% in IC trials. There was no significant difference of luminance between the two conditions. \n\n\n### SCR Parametric Modulation of Stroop Stimuli \n  \nModulating Stroop stimuli using SCR, a significant activation of the SN in the Stroop interference contrast was replicated (  x   = -6,   y   = -24,   z   = -15,   t   = 3.91,   p   < 0.005,   k   = 39) together with most cerebellar clusters (see   Table   ). In contrast, no activation of the periaqueductal gray was detected. \n  \nClusters with significant BOLD activations in the Stroop interference contrast after modulating task events by skin conductance responses (SCR) and pupil diameter responses (PDR) (with complete preprocessing). \n    \n\n### PDR Parametric Modulation of Stroop Stimuli \n  \nWhen Stroop stimuli were weighted by PDR, the Stroop interference contrast revealed a significant activation of a tube-like cluster at the posterior brainstem (  Figure    and   Table   ).

We demonstrate the enhancement of signal quality due to PNC as well as its beneficial effect on the statistical results. The signal to noise ratio was increased especially in tissue adjacent to arteries and spaces filled with cerebrospinal fluid. The analysis of PNC data replicated the involvement of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic system in cognitive control whereas uncorrected data revealed no brainstem/midbrain activations. We found that pupil size was a sensitive indicator of the level of cognitive demand. When Stroop stimuli were modulated by pupillary responses, we observed a significant activation of the LC. \n\nAbout 20,000\u201350,000 neurons build the LC as a symmetric structure at the dorsal brainstem with a rostrocaudal extent of 12\u201317 mm and a diameter of about 2.5 mm ( ;  ). It begins rostrally in the caudolateral part of the mesencephalic central gray, at the level of the inferior colliculus, and extends caudally to a position in the lateral wall of the fourth ventricle ( ;  ). Neurons of the LC project to various regions throughout the cerebral cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, brainstem, midbrain, cerebellum, and the spinal cord ( ;  ;  ). Electrophysiological studies have shown that the LC selectively responds to salient stimuli that entail attention disruption and reorientation ( ;  ). The recorded LC activity was previously decomposed into a tonic and phasic component ( ). Tonic activity represents a kind of baseline arousal and is low during certain automatic behavior and drowsiness. LC neurons become phasically activated by salient stimuli ( ;  ). \n\nThe LC is an important relay of the noradrenergic and dopaminergic circuitry of the brainstem ( ). The LC-noradrenergic system regulates the balance between selective and flexible attention. At rest, we have recently shown that the LC is functionally integrated into the executive-control network ( ). Under external stimulation, the LC seems to dynamically moderate the switch between distinct functional networks depending on the salience of incoming stimuli ( ;  ). It has been demonstrated previously that the incongruent Stroop task condition, requiring inhibitory control, activates the neural cognitive control network consisting of the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the posterior parietal cortex and subcortical structures ( ;  ;  ). In our recent study, we additionally found that incongruent Stroop stimuli trigger the activation of the LC ( ). In the current study, we wanted to investigate the influence of enhanced preprocessing techniques on BOLD activations during the Stroop task. \n\nConsidering the spatial extent of brainstem nuclei, functional MR imaging requires highly precise approaches ( ). In our current analysis, the spatial resolution is far more sensitive compared to previous investigations ( ;  ). Additionally, we prepared the acquired functional data by PNC involving cardiac and respiratory signals. We demonstrated that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of brainstem images benefits from PNC due to the presence of nearby major arteries and cerebrospinal fluid filled spaces ( ). Especially along the posterior border of the brainstem, an increase of temporal SNR was detected. In this region important nuclei of the ascending reticular system, the serotonergic system, the noradrenergic system etc. are located. After PNC and brainstem/cerebellum specialized co-registration an average temporal SNR of 67.8 was achieved. The SNR map resamples the results reported by  . He highlighted the effect of noise from non-neural sources and reviewed different correction approaches (e.g., RETROICOR). In brainstem fMRI, the increase of signal quality by using RETROICOR was documented previously (see  ;  ). In our approach here, we use five respiration volume per time regressors additionally to the RETROICOR cardiac and respiratory phase regressors ( ). \n\nIn this study, we show that PNC has a crucial impact on the results that revealed the analysis of BOLD activations during the Stroop task. Without PNC, the only activated cluster outside the cerebellum was located along the midline of the upper anterior pons. When analyzing PNC data, significant activations within the SN and a region adjacent to the aqueduct, presumably in the periaqueductal gray, were detected. The activation of the dopaminergic VTA and SN in the Stroop interference contrast was demonstrated previously ( ). The periaqueductal gray is an important interface of the midbrain/brainstem to cortical area with connections to areas involved in cognitive control such as the prefrontal and cingulate cortex as well as the ventral striatum ( ;  ). Via nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways, BOLD activations of the VTA/SN are associated with goal-directed motivational behavior ( ;  ). Therefore, the detected activations appear far more plausible when underlying data was corrected for the influence of physiological noise. As significant clusters in the Stroop interference contrast of corrected and uncorrected data did not overlap, PNC has fundamental influence on the results of our study. The analysis of uncorrected data revealed an activation running along the midline of the upper pons \u2013 an area susceptible to physiological noise. As our sample is rather small, statistical analyses are particularly vulnerable to spurious results due to artifacts and inaccurate co-registration. Thus, the correction for physiological noise seem essential to reveal adequate results. \n\nIn agreement with previous reports, the pupillary response (PDR) was sensitive to different demands of cognitive control in the Stroop task ( ;  ;  ). Similar to reaction times, PDR decreased over the course of the experiment with a more pronounced decline in the congruent than in the IC. Thus, the learning effect during the task seems to be reflected in pupillary reactions. \n\nSkin conductance responses were not different between both task conditions and were neither related to reaction times nor trial number. However, we observed a marked increase of SCR in the incongruent compared to the congruent condition, which might be statistically detectable in a bigger sample. The time course of skin conductance is determined by a tonic and a phasic component. Stimuli might elicit multiple overlapping SCR as well as an increase of the tonic level ( ). Although the area under curve was demonstrated to capture SCR characteristics appropriately ( ;  ), the variance of SCR measures seems to be higher than pupillary indices. \n\nThe reactions of physiological signals were used to weight Stroop stimuli. Parametric modulation with SCR led to similar results as the analysis without modulation. In the brainstem/midbrain, the only activation was found in the SN. When events are combined with pupillary responses, a significant activation of a tube-like cluster at the posterior brainstem was found. The activated cluster overlapped with both lateral branches of the upper LC as indicated by the anatomical mask of the LC ( ). Given the strong co-variation of LC activity during task performance and PD, we hypothesized that the pupillary signal might be useful to track LC activity ( ;  ;  ). It seems that the modulation of Stroop events with physiological information was more accurately modeling the BOLD activation in the LC than the standard GLM. \n\nHowever, the activated cluster is not completely matching the anatomical demarcation of the LC. The remaining activation between the two lateral branches of the LC might be due to a response of other nuclei located in this region, such as medial reticular nuclei or the dorsal raphe nucleus. Spatial smoothing might blur individual blobs of activation to a great cluster. However, smoothing improves the validity of statistical tests by normalizing the error distribution and compensating for small variations of individual brain anatomy. \n\nSome limitations of our study have to be addressed. A drawback of our experimental design is the lack of luminance control as words presented on the screen vary in length and color. Because luminance was not different in both conditions, a systematic influence on our results seems unlikely. Furthermore, the statistical power is limited with respect to sample size and number of Stroop stimuli. The parametric modulator had a strong impact on our results, which might be due to the restricted statistical power. However, our results indicate that the statistical analysis benefits from a precise modulation of BOLD activation using physiological markers. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, we used a sophisticated fMRI technique and physiological recordings to investigate the involvement of brainstem/midbrain nuclei in cognitive control. We demonstrated a positive effect of PNC on data quality and statistical results. Finally, we corroborated previous findings that the dopaminergic SN and noradrenergic LC play a central role in cognitive control and demonstrated the reproducibility of this result on a small sample ( ). We investigated PD and skin conductance as autonomic markers of cognitive demand. By including the pupillary responses in our functional data analysis, we validated the location and functional role of the LC. We conclude that physiological signals are useful for modeling noise contaminating the BOLD signal but also BOLD signal changes of interest. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Jena.

Previous studies using  F-FDG PET mainly focused on the motor or non-motor symptoms but not the severity of IPD. In this study, we aimed to determine the metabolic patterns of  F-FDG in different stages of IPD defined by Hoehn and Yahr rating scale (H-Y rating scale) and to identify regions in the brain that play critical roles in disease progression. Fifty IPD patients were included in this study. They were 29 men and 21 women (mean\u00b1SD, age 57.7\u00b111.1 years, disease duration 4.0\u00b13.8 years, H-Y 2.2\u00b11.1). Twenty healthy individuals were included as normal controls. Following  F-FDG PET scan, image analysis was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST). The metabolic feature of IPD and regions-of-interests (ROIs) were determined. Correlation analysis between ROIs and H-Y stage was performed. SPM analysis demonstrated a significant hypometabolic activity in bilateral putamen, caudate and anterior cingulate as well as left parietal lobe, prefrontal cortex in IPD patients. In contrast, hypermetabolism was observed in the cerebellum and vermis. There was a negative correlation (  p  =0.007,   r  =-0.412) between H-Y stage and caudate metabolic activity. Moreover, the prefrontal area also showed a negative correlation with H-Y (  P  =0.033,   r  =-0.334). Thus, the uptake of FDG in caudate and prefrontal cortex can potentially be used as a surrogate marker to evaluate the severity of IPD. \n \n\n# Body\n \nIdiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease (IPD) is a age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the asymmetrical loss of melanin-containing dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra [ ]. Neuronal death often occurs years before the time of symptom onset in IPD. By the time a patient presents with clinical symptoms, approximately 75% of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) were lost [ ]. Tracer based method to study dopamine receptor such as  C- CFT is not sensitive to predict the severity of IPD [ ]. The detection of Lewy body in brainstem (within the SN) or within the cortex can confirm the diagnosis of IPD but this method is not convenient, and it needs an invasive biopsy. Currently, the diagnosis of IPD mostly depends on the presence of motor symptoms such as rest tremor, rigidity and freezing of gait, which lacks objectivity, especially in early stages of IPD as the clinical symptoms often overlap with several \u2018look-alike\u2019 disorders [ - ]. To date, the availability of quantitative biomarkers to assess the progression of the disease objectively is limited. PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) is a hybrid in-vivo imaging technique that can track the brain pathophysiological activities in a noninvasive way in various neurological and psychiatric disorders [ ,  ]. The [18F]-fluorodeoxy-glucose ( F-FDG) PET assessing brain metabolism has demonstrated its utility in metabolic disorders including IPD [ ]. \n\nPrevious studies using FDG PET to analyze IPD patients mainly focused on the motor and no-motor symptoms such as cognitive, fatigue and anxiety[ - ], not the severity of disease. In addition, insights upon the progression of IPD and compensatory alterations in other parts of brain during disease progression are still lacking. Accurate and comprehensive description of the natural course and pathophysiological activity is pivotal to the assessment IPD as disease progresses.  F-FDG PET metabolic imaging analysis can measure pathological activity and has been widely used in IPD. It can be potentially used as an objective, quantifiable and stable biomarker for the diagnosis of IPD as well as the evaluation of disease progression and the response to treatment [ ,  ]. \n\nIn this study, we evaluated the metabolic pattern of  F-FDG using PET scan in 50 IPD patients and analyzed the relationship between metabolic activity of regions of interest (ROI) and H-Y stages. We identified the regions that were associated with disease progression. \n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nFrom March 2016 to November 2016, 55 IPD patients were recruited consecutively from the Department of Neurology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. All patients were fulfilled the diagnostic criteria proposed by the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank. All had disease stages clinically defined as \" medication off \" state by Hoehn and Yahr\u2019s (H&Y) rating scale and no patients had any occupying lesions in central nervous system. Among these 55 patients, 3 had progressive supranuclear palsy and 2 had severe brain atrophy; these 5 patients were excluded in this study. In total, 50 IPD patients were included for data analysis. We also recruited 20 age-matched healthy controls (11 men and 9 women, mean \u00b1 SD, 54.6 \u00b1 12.3 years) for comparison. They showed normal neurological examination results and had no history of any central nervous system diseases. All participants provided written informed consent. \n\n\n### PET Image Acquisition \n  \nEthical permission was obtained from Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University. All patients and healthy controls underwent brain  F-FDG PET imaging examination. Individuals fasted for at least 6 hours before  F-FDG injection and stopped taking any drugs (including oral antiparkinson medications) that could affect brain metabolism for at least 3 days prior to the scanning. The  F-FDG (37 MBq/kg) was injected intravenously in awake and resting state. PET image acquisition was started 60 minutes after the injection. The PET studies were performed using a Discovery ST, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA. Computed attenuation correction was utilized to correct the brain images for attenuation of 511-keV photons. Emission images were reconstructed in a 192 \u00d7192 \u00d7 47 matrix with a pixel size of 1.56 \u00d71.56 \u00d7 3.27 in the axial direction using the ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm, with 5 iterations and 32 subsets. Images were then corrected for attenuation using the CT transmission scan. Heart rate, blood pressure and pulse oximetry were measured during the PET procedure. \n\n\n### F-FDG PET Analysis \n  \nVisual Evaluation of PET Data: Brain F-FDG PET images were visually evaluated by 3 experienced nuclear medicine physicians. Brain areas with decreased and increased metabolic activity were identified and reported after at least 2 readers reached a consensus. \n\nSPM analysis: All images were converted from DICOM to NIFTI using MRIcon (University of South Carolina, USA). Images were then analyzed voxel-by-voxel using SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, University College, London, UK) running on Matlab (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA, USA). Firstly, PET images were spatially normalized into a common Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) atlas anatomical space, followed by a 12-parameter affine transformation and non-linear transformation. Secondly, 2\u00d72\u00d72mm voxels were constructed. Normalized images were smoothed with FWHM=12mm and Isotropic Gaussian Kernel to increase the signal to noise ratio. Preprocessed PET image values were corrected to a mean value of 50 mL/dL/min by \u201cproportional scaling\u201d to reduce individual variation. A mask with 0.8 intensity value was used to select voxels activity and to exclude extra cranial activities. A two-sample t-test was applied between diseased and control groups. To reduce the impact of age and gender, both factors were regressed out as covariates. The P value and extended voxel size (k) were thresholded at two levels and three levels, respectively:   p  < 0.001(matched with k > 50, 100, 200 voxels corrected, respectively) and   p   < 0.01 (matched with k > 50, 100, 200 voxels corrected, respectively). In addition, we chose the smaller   p   value first since   p   value wasn\u2019t correct with false discovery rate (FDR) or Familywise error rate (FWE), but the central hypometabolic regions had been kept unchanged among at least two voxel sizes simultaneously as described in our previous study [ ]. \n\nThe significant clusters were tested to see whether they were closely related to clinical characters. Then the ROIs were automatically delineated with REST ( ) on MNI atlas anatomical space with parametric PET images. Brain regions that showed   p   < 0.001 at voxel level were considered significant and were computed and transformed into z-scores. Accordingly, a subsequent correlation analysis between the metabolic activity of ROIs and H-Y rating scale was conducted using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). \n  \nClinical and Demographic characteristics of 50 patients (29 men; 21 women) and 20 health control (13 men; 7 women). \n    \n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Patient information \n  \nThere were 50 IPD patients in total (29 men and 21 women, mean\u00b1SD, age 57.7\u00b111.1 years, disease duration 4.0\u00b13.8 years, Hoehn and Yahr Stage 2.2\u00b11.1). Among them, 18 patients were diagnosed as H&Y stage I, 15 patient stage II, 12 patient stage III, 2 patient stage IV and 3 patient stage V ( ). In terms of therapy, 41 patients had received levodopa treatment after diagnosis and the remaining 9 patients did not receive medical intervention. All clinical information was listed in  . Twenty age-matched healthy individuals (13 men and 7 women, mean \u00b1 SD, age 55.6 \u00b1 12.3 years) were recruited as controls. \n\n\n### Demographic characteristics \n  \nChi-square test and Mann-Whitney U-test were performed respectively for gender and age comparison between IPD patients and healthy controls. There was no significant difference between the demographic data of the two groups, including gender (  p   = 0.292) and age (  p   = 0.21). \n\n\n### PET results and statistical Analysis \n  \nBy visual analysis, 90% (45/50) IPD patients appeared normal on FDG PET, and only 10% (5/50) showed abnormal metabolic activity and 3 of them had severe IPD in stage IV and V. \n\nNext, we performed SPM analysis. The difference between the IPD patients and the age-matched controls was calculated using the extent threshold 100 voxel-level with   p  <0.001,   P   <0.05. As shown in  , SPM analysis demonstrated that IPD patients had a significantly decreased metabolic activity in the areas of bilateral putamen, caudate and anterior cingulate when compared to heathy controls. Bilateral parietal lobes, temporal lobe and prefrontal area also showed decreased metabolic activity in IPD patients. In contrast, relative hypermetabolic activity was observed in the cerebellum and vermis in IPD patients ( ). \n\nTo investigate the relationship between metabolic activity in significant clusters and H-Y stages, we measured the absolute glucose metabolic values in these regions and performed a correlation analysis between their metabolic activity and H-Y stages. As shown in  , caudate (A) and prefrontal (B) metabolic activity showed a negative correlation with H-Y stage, whereas no correlation was found in vermis (C), angular (D), occipital (E) and temporal lobes (F). \n\nWe also studied the relationship between disease duration and stages. H-Y stages and disease duration had a moderate positive correlation (  p   =0.001, r=0.657) and a positive linear correlation between H-Y and UPDRS III scores was identified (  p   =0.001, r=0.75). \n\n  \nThe metabolism of FDG in IPD patients compared to healthy controls. Brain areas with increased/decreased glucose metabolism are superimposed on the Montreal Neurological Institute template (Top row) (  p   < 0.001, uncorrected) and the 3D render (Bottom row). A) Significant hypometabolism in bilateral putamen, caudate, anterior cingulate, parietal lobe and prefrontal cortex was identified. B) The relative hypermetabolism was identified in the cerebellum and vermis. \n  \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nMolecular imaging analysis especially using  F-FDG is a popular tool for the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of IPD. In this study we explored the metabolic activity of different brain areas in IPD patients using  F-FDG PET. We demonstrated that SPM is an effective tool to analyze the data and showed that the metabolic activity of caudate and prefrontal cortex negatively correlated with the severity of disease in IPD patients. \n\nThe metabolic patterns of FDG in IPD patients have been studied but results have been inconsistent in terms of the affected areas as well as the precise distribution and the trend (i.e., increases or decreases) of metabolic changes. Eidelberg previously used PD-related pattern (PDRP) and identified increased metabolic activity in pallido-thalamic and pontine, and decreased activity in supplementary motor area (SMA), parietal association, and areas of premotor cortex [ ]. The increased regions of PDRP such as the putamen and thalamus had a linear relationship with patients\u2019 standardized motor ratings [ - ]. PD-related cognitive pattern (PDCP) was related to memory and executive function in IPD patients. It was characterized by a metabolic decrease in the medial frontal and parietal associated regions as well as a relative metabolic increase in the cerebellar vermis [ ]. Other studies showed a symmetric/asymmetric hypometabolic activity in the prefrontal, lateral frontal cortices, middle temporal gyrus, bilateral parietal association cortices, and bilateral occipital cortices, as well as a relative hypermetabolic activity in the vermis and cerebellum [ ,  ]. In addition, Strafella et al. found that IPD patients often showed asymmetric involvement of dopaminergic neurons in striatum [ ]. \n\n   The relationship between the metabolic activity of ROIs and H-Y stages  \nA) In caudate, the metabolic activity decreased as H-Y stages increased (  p  =0.004 r=-0.441). B) Similar to caudate, prefrontal metabolic activity also decreased as H-Y stages increased (  p  =0.004 r=-0.441). C, D, E and F, show no correlation in vermis (C), angular (D), occipital (E) and temporal lobes (F). The Pearson correlation analysis was performed using SPSS software. \n  \n\nIn this study we found that IPD patients had reduced uptake in bilateral putamen, caudate, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex and increased uptake in vermis and cerebellum when compared to healthy controls. This is similar to the finding reported previously [ ]. More interestingly, we found that there was a negative relationship between H-Y rating scale and caudate metabolic activity; the higher the H-Y scale, the lower rate of caudate metabolism. The implication of this finding is twofold: first, the measurement of caudate metabolic activity can potentially offer valuable clues for early diagnosis of IPD and monitoring disease progression; second, caudate may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IPD. Future studies to explore the role of caudate in IPD will shed light on the mechanism of disease development and progression. Of note, the potential role of caudate in IPD has been indicated in previous studies [ - ]. Autopsy study demonstrated an uneven pattern of dopamine loss in the caudate nucleus in IPD patients and previous studies showed caudate hypofunction was specific in the executive domain and related to injured nigrostriatal dopaminergic function [ ,  ]. Ko et al found that the increased uptake of caudate was correlated with motor symptom severity [ ]. Evidences from in vivo PET also connected caudate dopamine depletion and executive deficits in PD patients [ ,  ,  ]. \n  \nMNI coordinate of significant clusters. \n    \nAnother finding in our study is that prefrontal metabolic activity decreased as the disease progressed ( ,   p  =0.033,   r  =-0.334). Prefrontal cortex receives input from anterior cingulate area, a major locus of dopaminergic input to the cerebral cortex [ ]. Previous study showed that cognitive decline and behavioral abnormalities were associated with functional deficits in prefrontal cortex and striatum. After deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, the  F-FDG activity in frontal lobe and the cognitive outcome showed a linear relationship. These indicated a potential relationship between striatum and frontal cortex [ ,  ]. Evidences from human and monkey studies showed that caudate deficit may be related to the impaired frontal tasks [ ]. In our study, both the caudate and prefrontal cortex showed a correlation to the disease severity. This indicates there may be an association between cortical and subcortical changes during IPD disease progression. \n\nFuture studies will aim to recruit more patients at stages IV and V as the majority of patients in the current study were stages I-III. Cognitive data will be collected in future studies. Other PET tracers, such as \u00b9\u00b9C, H O will be used to determine the pattern and compare to  F-FDG used in this study. Finally, a longer follow-up with changes in PET pattern will be performed for the current patient group to determine the dynamic changes in IPD. \n\nIn summary, a voxel-by-voxel based statistical mapping method, i.e. SPM12 analysis by PET scan, is a valuable tool for evaluation of disease progression in IPD. The uptake of FDG in caudate and prefrontal cortex is associated with different stages of IPD, serving as a valuable biomarker to estimate the severity of IPD. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1-ad-10-4-847\n### Label: Table 1\nCharacteristics\tIPD (Mean/ SD, Range)\tHealth control (Mean/ SD, Range)\nAge, yr\t57.7/11.1, (31-87)\t55.6 \u00b1 12.3 (29-75)\nDisease duration, yr\t4.0/3.8, (0.5-17)\t-\nUPDRS III\t27.8/8.9, (13-45)\t-\nH-Y last\t\t-\nStage 1\t18\t-\nStage 2\t11\t-\nStage 2.5\t4\t-\nStage 3\t12\t-\nStage 4\t2\t-\nStage 5\t3\t-\n### Caption\nClinical and Demographic characteristics of 50 patients (29 men; 21 women) and 20 health control (13 men; 7 women).\n### Footer\nSD = standard deviation; H-Y= Hoehn and Yahr; UPDRS III, part III of unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale.\n\n\n## ID: T2-ad-10-4-847\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tRegion\tMNI coordinate\tMNI coordinate\tMNI coordinate\tT score\tp-value\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tRegion\tx\ty\tz\tT score\tp-value\nIPD<HC\tCaudate\t12\t10\t0\t4.46\t0.0\nIPD<HC\tFrontal lobe\t6\t62\t20\t3.63\t0.0\nIPD<HC\tTemporal\t50\t-2\t-7\t4.48\t0.001\nIPD<HC\tOccipital\t-20\t-81\t34\t4.04\t0.0\nIPD<HC\tAnterior Cingulate\t10\t28\t22\t5.0\t0.001\nIPD<HC\tParietal lobe\t-50\t-56\t44\t3.88\t0.0\nIPD>HC\tCerebelum\t10\t-62\t-32\t3.63\t0.0\nIPD>HC\tVermis\t-32\t-62\t52\t4.44\t0.0\n### Caption\nMNI coordinate of significant clusters.\n### Footer\nP<0.001, uncorrected; HC; healthy control; IPD: idiopathic Parkinson disease; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute.\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6675526, "text_md5": "f001c8cf35c18184ab078f543d895e38", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 169], "journal": [170, 179], "publication_year": [181, 185], "title": [196, 325], "keywords": [339, 421], "abstract": [434, 2115], "body": [2124, 17793], "tables": [17806, 19030]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 31440389, "doi": "10.14336/AD.2018.0814", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6675526", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6675526"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6675526\">6675526</a>", "list_title": "PMC6675526  The Metabolic Activity of Caudate and Prefrontal Cortex Negatively Correlates with the Severity of Idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s Disease"}

Studies suggested that SCD-community individuals may constitute a more vulnerable population than SCD-clinic patients, therefore, to investigate the early changes of the brain may provide guidance for treatment of the disease.

These brain region and FC showing significant differences also showed significantly correlation with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIndividuals with SCD recruited from the community is associated with structural and functional changes of the hippocampus, and these changes may serve as potential biomarkers of SCD. \n\n\n## Clinical Trial Registration \n  \nThe Declaration of Helsinki, and the study was registered in  . The Clinical Trial Registration Number was ChiCTR-IPR-16009144. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is increasing all over the world. According to the World Alzheimer Report ( ), there were about 50 million people worldwide living with dementia in 2018, and this number is expected to more than triple by 2050. However, there are no effective treatments for AD, and recent drugs targeting tau pathology and amyloid-\u03b2 at the mild or moderate dementia stage have failed to treat the disease ( ;  ). Moreover, the difficulties of treating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) suggests that treatment should be applied at an earlier stage of the disease ( ;  ). \n\nSubjective cognitive decline (SCD) has been described as the earliest at-risk state of AD and increases the risk for developing MCI and future AD ( ;  ). It refers to individuals who have self-perceived persistent decline in cognition while neuropsychological tests remain within the normal range ( ). Recently, SCD has been receiving increased attention as a risk factor for the development of AD ( ). \n\nIn addition, studies have suggested that the recruitment sources for SCD studies may have a significant influence on study outcomes. For instance   found higher atrophy progression over time and a relatively smaller proportion of APOE \u03b54 carriers in patients from an SCD clinic compared SCD patients from the community. This finding reinforced their previous study, which found that those who seek consultation are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s clinical syndrome ( ). It indicated that SCD-clinic patients may constitute a more vulnerable population than SCD-community patients. They may be at increased risk for cognitive decline and possibly Alzheimer\u2019s clinical syndrome ( ). \n\nIn recent years, brain imaging has been used to investigate the structural and functional alterations of individuals with SCD. A number of papers on SCD have revealved reduced volume in medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures, including the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex ( ;  ;  ;  ). These brain alterations are similar to those found in MCI patients, suggesting that SCD may be a pre-MCI stage ( ). Functional changes have also been detected in individuals with SCD. For example, task-based fMRI studies ( ;  ) have identified neural network disruptions during cognitive processes in SCD compared with controls. \n\nTo our knowledge, few studies have been applied on SCD-community individuals. In this study, we combined voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis and resting-state functional connectivity to investigate the patterns of structural and functional brain alterations in individuals with SCD recruited from the community compared with healthy controls. We hypothesized that functional connectivity disruption with or without hippocampal atrophy may be detected in SCD-community individuals compared with healthy controls (HC). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nAll research procedures were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study was registered in  . \n\n### Participants \n  \nThirty-five SCD subjects and 32 healthy control subjects were recruited from local communities between January 2016 and January 2018. All participants went through standard clinical assessments, including interviews with medical history, neurological examinations, and a series of neuropsychological tests. The neuropsychological tests were conducted by two neurologists and included the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Scale, and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). In addition, there were six neuropsychological tests. Specifically, delayed recall and recognition of Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Animal Fluency Test, the 30-item Boston Naming Test (BNT), and Part A and Part B of the Trail Making Test (TMT) were used to evaluate participants\u2019 three cognitive domains: memory, language, and attention/executive function. \n\n\n### Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria \n  \nBased on the definition of SCD by  , inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Aged 55\u201375 years old; (2) Self-reported cognitive decline; (3) Normal general cognitive examination scores: MoCA-A: primary school and below >19, secondary school >22, university >24; MMSE: illiterate >17, primary school >20, junior school and above >24 points; CDR: 0. \n\nExclusion criteria were: (1) MCI or dementia; (2) Vascular disease; (3) Severe depression; (4) Neurological diseases that may cause cognitive problems (such as brain tumors, Parkinson\u2019s disease, encephalitis, epilepsy, etc.); (5) Brain trauma; (6) Other systemic diseases that can cause cognitive impairment, such as thyroid dysfunction, severe anemia, syphilis, HIV, etc.; (7) People with a history of mental illness or congenital intellectual disability; (8) Severe hearing or visual impairment, language communication disorders; (9) MRI contraindications (e.g., metal dentures or other metal implants that cannot be removed, claustrophobia, etc.); (10) Left-handed and double-handed (11) Non-handed elderly people. Details of the data collection process are exhibited as a flowchart ( ). \n  \nFlowchart shows details of data collection process.

To avoid head movement, each participant\u2019s head was immobilized by foam pads in a standard 8-channel birdcage head coil. BOLD-fMRI images were obtained with a single-shot gradient-recalled echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) / echo time (TE) = 2000 ms/30 ms, field of view (FOV) = 240 \u00d7 240 mm, flip angle = 90\u00b0, matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64, slice thickness = 5 mm, and slices = 31. High-resolution T1-weighted images were then acquired with a volumetric 3D spoiled gradient recall sequence with the following parameters: TR/TE = 1900 ms/2.22 ms, FOV = 250 mm \u00d7 250 mm, flip angle = 9\u00b0, matrix size: 256 \u00d7 256, slice thickness = 1 mm, and 176 slices. \n\n\n### Brain Morphometry Data Analysis \n  \nThe processing of structural MRI data was performed with the VBM12-toolbox  incorporated in Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12 ). Each MRI image was first segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using VBM12-toolbox. Then, the GM images were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the Diffeomorphic Anatomic Registration of the using Exponentiated Lie (DARTEL) algorithm. The registered gray matter partitions were multiplied by Jacobian determinants with only non-linear warping to exclude individual differences in total intracranial volume. Finally, modulated warped GM segments were resliced to an isotropic voxel-size of 1.5 mm . Volumes were automatically determined from the modulated warped resliced GM segments. The GM segments were smoothed with a Gaussian smoothing kernel of 8 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM). \n\nGroup analysis was applied using a two-sample   t  -test in SPM 12 with gender, age, GDS, years of education, and whole brain volume as covariates. A voxel-wise threshold of   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected) and a cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.05 (family-wise error correction) were applied for data analysis. In addition, given the important role of the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in memory processing ( ;  ,  ;  ), we predefined the left / right hippocampus and MPFC as regions of interest and prepared templates using the WFU PickAtlas tool . A voxel-wise threshold of   p   < 0.005 and a cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.05 corrected using 3dClustSim were applied for the regions of interest data analysis. \n\n\n### Resting State Functional Connectivity Data Analysis \n  \nPreprocessing was performed with CONN (CONN ). The first five volumes of each functional time series were removed to avoid the instability of the initial MRI signal. The remaining images were corrected for acquisition time delay between different slices and realigned to the first volume. The head motion parameters were calculated by estimating the translation in every direction and the angular rotation on each axis for every volume. \n\nThe realigned functional images were then spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the normalization parameters estimated by T1 structural image unified segmentation and re-sampled to 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm voxels. Several sources of spurious variance, such as the estimated motion parameters and average BOLD signals in ventricular and white matter regions, were removed from the images. After removing the variance, linear drift was removed and a temporal filter (0.01\u20130.08 Hz) was then performed on the time series of each voxel to reduce the effect of low-frequency drifts and high-frequency noise. Artifact detection toolbox was used to further correct head motion. \n\nIn this study, the regions of interest (seeds) were 1) hippocampus areas that showed significant difference between the SCD and controls derived from VBM analysis (bilateral hippocampal tail) and 2) bilateral whole hippocampus as defined by AAL atlas ( ). \n\nThe mean BOLD time course was extracted from the selected seeds of each subject. Pearson correlation coefficients were estimated between the mean time course of the seed region and the time courses of all other voxels. Pearson correlation coefficients were then normalized to z-scores with Fisher\u2019s r-to-z transformation to acquire the entire brain z-score map of each subject for each condition. \n\nA two-sample   t  -test was applied in SPM12 to compare the differences between the two groups. A voxel-wise threshold of   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected) and a cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.05 (family-wise error corrected) were applied for data analysis. Age, gender, GDS, and years of education were included as covariates. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nDemographic and clinical data were analyzed in SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, Inc.). Measured data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. A two-sample   t  -test was used to compare age, years of education, and MoCA. Sex between groups was compared using a Pearson chi-squared test. Comparisons of clinical difference among the two groups (HC and SCD) were performed with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and all demographic factors (gender, age, GDS, years of education, and whole brain volume) as covariates. Correlation analysis was used to estimate the relationship between MoCA and AVLT scores and neuroimaging findings in SCD and HC (  p   < 0.05 was considered significant). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and Clinical Results \n  \nThirty-five SCD and 32 HC subjects were included in our study. There were no significant differences in age, sex, education, and MoCA between SCD subjects and HC subjects ( ). \n  \nDemographics and cognitive scores of healthy control and SCD groups. \n    \n\n### Brain Volume Analysis \n  \nVBM analysis showed that SCD is associated with significantly decreased gray matter volume (GMV) in the bilateral hippocampal tails and increased GMV in the bilateral paracentral lobules compared with HC subjects (  and  ). \n  \nVoxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis revealed altered gray matter volume in the SCD group compared to the HC group. Scatter plots illustrate MoCA scores and VBM correlation analysis. \n    \nAbnormal brain volume in SCD compared with HC. \n    \nTo explore the association between the VBM and clinical outcomes, we applied a correlation analysis between brain areas showing significant VBM difference and MoCA scores and found the decreased GMV of the left hippocampal tail was negatively correlated with MoCA scores[  r   = \u22120.317,   p   < 0.011, significant after Bonferroni correction (0.05/3)], the similar correlation was also found between the right hippocampal tail and MoCA scores (  r   = \u22120.327,   p   = 0.010, significant after Bonferroni correction). The increased GMV of the bilateral paracentral lobules showed a trend to positive correlation with MoCA scores. Exploratory (  r   = 0.262,   p   = 0.042, not significant after Bonferroni correction) across all subjects. Exploratory analysis showed that the decreased left hippocampal tail volume was significantly positive correlated with AVLT-delayed recall (dr) scores (  r   = 0.266,   p   = 0.037) ( ,  ). \n  \nCorrelation analysis between AVLT-Delayed recall scores and altered gray matter volume of the left hippocampus tail in the SCD group. \n  \n\n### Resting State Functional Connectivity Results \n  \nWith the bilateral hippocampal tail as the seed, SCD subjects showed decreased rsFC with the right mPFC and the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ) compared to HC subjects (  and  ). With the whole hippocampus as the seed, similar results were observed (i.e., SCD subjects showed decreased FC with the bilateral mPFC and the bilateral TPJ compared to HC subjects) (  and  ). \n  \nFunctional connectivity analysis results using the hippocampal tail and whole hippocampus as seed. Scatter plots indicate the association between the MoCA scores and connectivity correlation analysis. \n    \nAbnormal functional connectivity in SCD compared with HC. \n    \nTo explore the association between functional connectivity and clinical outcomes, we applied a correlation analysis between brain areas showing significant functional connectivity difference and MoCA scores, and we found that MoCA scores were negatively correlated with the decreased bilateral hippocampus tails-right mPFC rsFC (  r   = \u22120.449,   p   < 0.001, significant after Bonferroni correction), bilateral hippocampus tail-left TPJ rsFC (  r   = \u22120.467,   p   < 0.001, significant after Bonferroni correction),bilateral hippocampus-bilateral mPFC rsFC (  r   = \u22120.374,   p   = 0.002, significant after Bonferroni correction) and bilateral hippocampus-bilateral TPJ rsFC (  r   = \u22120.395,   p   = 0.001, significant after Bonferroni correction) across all subjects ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we investigated the differences of brain morphometry and resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) between SCD (recruited from the community) and controls. We found that SCD is associated with a GMV decrease in the bilateral hippocampal tails and a GMV increase in the bilateral paracentral lobules. In addition, SCD subjects showed decreased hippocampus rsFC with the mPFC and TPJ. \n\nHippocampus plays an important role in memory processing and is considered among the first regions affected in AD pathological process ( ), of which the decreased volume is one of the most validated and widely used biomarkers of AD ( ). Converging evidences demonstrated total ( ) or partial ( ;  ) hippocampus volume decreased in SCD. In the present study, we found decreased GMV of bilateral hippocampal tails in individuals with SCD which was consistent with previous studies. In addiction, the decreased left hippocampus tail GMV was significantly positive correlated with AVLT-dr scores which showed significant group difference. Studies revealed that AVLT is among the most sensitive episodic memory tests ( ) and the delayed recall test was indicated to best identify early AD as well as predict the conversion to AD ( ;  ). It is universally known that episodic memory is the first cognitive domain involved in the AD spectrum and the most sensitive neuropsychological indicator for early AD ( ). The AD pattern of gray matter was found in SCD which correlated with episodic memory decline ( ), and RAVLT demonstrated significant association with the Hippocampal Occupancy Score and hippocampal volumes in the AD spectrum ( ). However, the change of hippocampus tends to be asymmetry in SCD, and the structural MRI studies revealed a decreased volume preferred the right hippocampus ( ). While the verbal information may depend on the left hippocampus ( ), which supports our result. \n\nWe also found an increased GMV in the paracentral lobule in individuals with SCD, which has not been previously reported. The paracentral lobule is comprised in the sensorimotor network and involved in the primary sensation and movement of the lower back, legs, and feet, as well as control of the bladder and bowel function. The alterations of pathology and structure in the sensorimotor cortices was least observed in aMCI and they are found to be preserved in AD relatively ( ;  ). Accordingly, the increased ReHo found in the sensorimotor network might be interpreted as compensatory mechanism to the functional disruptions of other brain networks ( ). However, study with the result of functional abnormality in aMCI ( ) provided support to the assumption that part of the motor areas might have cognitive functions ( ). Decreased volume in the paracentral lobule was found in AD ( ). A recent study revealed altered subnetworks including paracentral lobule which were correlated with the scores of the neurocognitive assessments in SCD ( ). We speculate that the enlargement of the paracentral lobule may reflecting a potential compensatory mechanism. It is still uncertain whether it has underlying correlation with cognitive function or be affected indirectly by the disruption of other brain regions. Further studies are needed to validate our finding. \n\nWe identified significant disrupted connectivity between the hippocampal tail/whole hippocampus and the mPFC and TPJ, and these disruptions were negatively correlated with MoCA scores. These areas are all important regions of the default mode network (DMN) ( ), which has been vulnerable to AD. It is worth noting that using the whole hippocampus as a seed resulted in more extensive functional connectivity changes than using only the hippocampal tail as a seed. Studies suggest that hippocampal subregions may play different roles ( ;  ) and are affected differently in patients with AD ( ;  ).   and   used the hippocampal subfields or the whole hippocampus as seeds and revealed functional connectivity disruption in brain regions including the mPFC, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, temporal lobe, and angular cortex in AD and SCD. Our results are consistent with previous studies and provide indirect support for a previous hypothesis that functional abnormality may occur before structural alteration in patients with SCD ( ). \n\nLiterature suggests that communication between the hippocampus and mPFC plays an important role in memory processes ( ;  ;  ). For instance, Van Kesteren et al. ( ,  ) investigated how connections between the hippocampus and the mPFC relate to the incorporation of new memories into existing abstract frameworks. They found that hippocampus-mPFC connectivity is enhanced during and shortly after the successful encoding of novel information.   found that functional connectivity between the hippocampal tail and mPFC was associated with accuracy of memory self-rating, which indicates that hippocampus-mPFC functional connectivity is closely related to memory. Investigators have also found decreased functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and superior mPFC in SCD ( ). In a previous study, we found that mind-body intervention can significantly modulate hippocampus-mPFC rsFC and that this change is associated with memory function changes ( ). Thus, our results align with previous findings. \n\nThe TPJ refers to an area of the cortex at the junction of the posterior superior temporal sulcus, inferior parietal lobule, and lateral occipital cortex. A brain imaging study ( ) suggested that the TPJ is involved in various processes such as episodic memory retrieval, attention, language and speech, temporal processing, social cognition and resting state activity.   investigated functional connectivity between the bilateral TPJ and other brain regions, such as the prefrontal, middle cingulate cortex, and insula, and found that the right TPJ functional connectivity was strongest with the ventral attention network, while left TPJ connectivity was strongest with the executive control network (ECN). Consequently, altered functional connectivity between the hippocampus and TPJ may contribute to the abnormal memory and attention function in SCD. \n\nMontreal Cognitive Assessment is an efficient and rapid screening tool for cognitive dysfunction involving memory, executive function, and attention ( ) and has moderate specificity and high sensitivity ( ). Previous studies have found that MoCA scores significantly correlate with both structural and functional brain alterations in SCD ( ;  ). We also observed a significant correlation between MoCA scores and both structural and functional alterations in the current study, which shed light on the significance of these brain function and morphometry findings. \n\nThere are several potential limitations to the present study. First, our results were limited by the relatively small sample sizes. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to further confirm our findings. Second, the participants involved in our study were only recruited from the community. SCD participants recruited from hospitals/clinics (i.e., medical help-seeking individuals) should be involved in future studies, and a comparison should be between these two groups. Third, we only included structural MRI and rs-fMRI. Future studies could incorporate relevant biomarkers such as \u03b2-amyloid and tau proteins. Finally, the present study was cross-sectional. A longitudinal study is needed to assess whether structural and functional alterations in SCD could predict the development of the disease. \n\nIn summary, we found that SCD individuals recruited from the community is associated with decreased GMV at the hippocampal tail, increased GMV at the paracentral lobules, and decreased hippocampus rsFC with the mPFC and TPJ. Our findings may shed new light on the neuroimaging biomarker of SCD. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Medicine Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine.

However, the unique contribution of the parahippocampal cortex remains unclear. The current study investigates memory for object identity and memory of the configuration of objects in patients with small thermo-coagulation lesions to the hippocampus or the parahippocampal cortex. Results showed that in contrast to control participants and patients with damage to the hippocampus leaving the parahippocampal cortex intact, patients with lesions that included the right parahippocampal cortex (RPH) were severely impaired on a task that required learning the spatial configuration of objects on a computer screen; these patients, however, were not impaired at learning the identity of objects. Conversely, we found that patients with lesions to the right hippocampus (RH) or left hippocampus (LH), sparing the parahippocampal cortex, performed just as well as the control participants. Furthermore, they were not impaired on the object identity task. In the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experiment, healthy young adults performed the same tasks. Consistent with the findings of the lesion study, the fMRI results showed significant activity in the RPH in the memory for the spatial configuration condition, but not memory for object identity. Furthermore, the pattern of fMRI activity measured in the baseline control conditions decreased specifically in the parahippocampal cortex as a result of the experimental task, providing evidence for task specific repetition suppression. In summary, while our previous studies demonstrated that the hippocampus is critical to the construction of a cognitive map, both the lesion and fMRI studies have shown an involvement of the RPH for learning spatial configurations of objects but not object identity, and that this takes place independent of the hippocampus. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe hippocampal region has been implicated in memory for various kinds of information, such as memory for spatial relations (O\u2019Keefe and Nadel,  ; Gaffan,  ), object location (Smith and Milner,  ), facts and events (Squire,  ), episodes (Vargha-Khadem et al.,  ; Tulving and Markowitsch,  ) and establishing stimulus-stimulus relationships (Petrides,  ; Eichenbaum,  ). It has also been shown that bilateral lesions to the medial temporal lobe lead to profound memory deficits (Scoville and Milner,  ; Milner,  ; Corkin,  ), while unilateral lesions lead to milder memory impairments that can be detected with cognitive assessment tools in the laboratory (Milner,  ; Petrides,  ). \n\nIt was only later that the mnemonic role of medial temporal lobe structures adjacent to the hippocampus, such as the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortical regions, has been dissociated from that of the hippocampus in monkeys (Meunier et al.,  ; Murray and Mishkin,  ; Malkova et al.,  ; Malkova and Mishkin,  ). Studies showing that patients with lesions involving the parahippocampal cortex are impaired on a memory task do not provide information about the specific role of this structure since the hippocampus receives afferents from the parahippocampal cortex, via the entorhinal cortex (Van Hoesen,  ; Suzuki and Amaral,  ) and also directly (Rockland and Van Hoesen,  ). Thus, impairments after parahippocampal lesions can be attributed to a functional de-afferentation of the hippocampus. On the other hand, the parahippocampal cortex maintains its own strong afferent and efferent connectivity with several cortical areas, including the inferior parietal cortex (Van Hoesen,  ; Blatt et al.,  ). In order to show that the parahippocampal cortex is itself critical in certain aspects of mnemonic processing, it is necessary to show that patients with lesions to the hippocampus alone are either not impaired on particular tasks, or impaired less than patients with lesions to the parahippocampal cortex. Such a result would argue against the notion that deficits after parahippocampal damage merely reflect a functional hippocampal lesion. \n\nIn the human brain, lesions to parahippocampal cortex and cortical regions providing input to it, such as the lingual gyrus and the inferior parietal cortex have been implicated in topographical memory loss (Landis et al.,  ; Habib and Sirigu,  ; Hublet and Demeurisse,  ; Maguire et al.,  ; Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito,  ; Epstein et al.,  ), i.e., an impairment in the ability to find one\u2019s way in the environment. Although studies of topographical amnesia point to damage in the parahippocampal cortex, or to regions surrounding it, they do not exclude the possibility of a functional hippocampal lesion. \n\nVery few case studies have effectively dissociated the mnemonic role of the parahippocampal cortex from that of the hippocampus with selective lesions (Ploner et al.,  ). In a study of spatial memory by Bohbot et al. ( ), epilepsy patients with selective thermal lesions to the right hippocampus (RH) were not impaired at finding a sensor hidden under a floor carpet, relative to patient control participants, after a 30-min delay while using novel starting positions, thereby requiring allocentric spatial memory, i.e., navigation that is independent of the position of the observer. On the other hand, patients with lesions to the parahippocampal cortex were severely impaired on this spatial task relative to the control group. Interestingly, patients and controls exhibited similar search patterns on the first trial, indicating that planning a search for the target is not dependent on medial temporal lobe areas (Bohbot et al.,  ). In monkeys, lesions to the parahippocampal cortex, but not the hippocampus, impaired performance on a delayed match-to-sample task that required memory for the locations of two objects presented over two of three foodwells (Malkova and Mishkin,  ). In this paradigm (Parkinson et al.,  ), monkeys are shown the locations of two objects in a sample phase, and in a subsequent test phase, they are shown two objects identical to one of the previously seen objects. In order to receive a reward, the monkey must select the object at the same location it occupied in the sample phase. \n\nInterestingly, a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study using navigation tasks that required different types of spatial representations demonstrated that, although the medial temporal lobe was activated on all tasks, the core of the activity was in the posterior parahippocampal gyrus with minimal involvement of the hippocampus itself (Rosenbaum et al.,  ). Several other fMRI studies have also demonstrated a clear dissociation between the function of the hippocampus and the parahippocampal cortex. In a virtual navigation task in which participants had to navigate in an environment devoid of landmarks during fMRI scanning and, therefore, were forced to use an egocentric navigation strategy, bilateral activity was observed in the parahippocampal cortex but not the hippocampus (Weniger et al.,  ). Morgan et al. ( ) had participants view pictures of familiar landmarks while lying in an fMRI scanner. Activity in the hippocampus was related to the distance between the landmarks, while activity in the parahippocampal cortex was related to landmark repetition. In an fMRI study by Howard et al. ( ) in which subjects were administered an incidental target detection task, the hippocampus was selectively active when the spatial relationships between the objects and the background context changed. In contrast, the parahippocampal cortex was selectively active for novel scenes. In Hartley et al. ( ), the authors distinguish between performance-independent effects and performance-related effects. They report activity in the parahippocampal cortex during the wayfinding task, unrelated to performance. In contrast, they report activity in the hippocampus during wayfinding that is associated with accurate performance. Our previous studies also demonstrated that the hippocampus is critical to learning the spatial relationships between landmarks in the environments (Bohbot et al.,  ; Konishi et al.,  ). Perhaps a critical element that distinguished studies that showed a critical involvement of the hippocampus vs. parahippocampal cortex in allocentric spatial memory, is that the hippocampus seemed to require a \u201cconstruction\u201d process, from memory, of detailed relationships between objects or landmarks in the environment, in a scene or episodes (Rosenbaum et al.,  ). Taken together, these studies and several others (Duzel et al.,  ; Goh et al.,  ; Pihlajam\u00e4ki et al.,  ; K\u00f6hler et al.,  ) further support the notion that the parahippocampal cortex is functionally dissociable from the hippocampus. Still, very few studies have dissociated the role of the parahippocampal cortex from that of the hippocampus in brain damaged patients, because selective lesions to the hippocampus rarely occur as a result of vascular incidents, diseases, accidents, or surgical interventions. \n\nWhile there are many fMRI studies and many lesion studies looking at spatial memory and the medial temporal lobe, there are very few reports combining lesion and fMRI using the same paradigm. In the present article, we report a dissociation of the role of the parahippocampal cortex from that of the hippocampus in memory for the configuration of objects but not their identity. This was achieved with a special cohort of patients with small selective thermocoagulation lesions to the hippocampus and/or the parahippocampal cortex in an attempt to alleviate epilepsy. Our results from the patient study were then confirmed with a second study involving fMRI with healthy young adults. \n\n\n## Experiment 1: Cognitive Lesion Study \n  \n### Materials and Methods \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nTwo control groups and four groups of brain-operated patients were tested (see Table  ). These patients have been described elsewhere (Bohbot et al.,  ). One control group consisted of patients with back-pain problems and no epileptic problems. The second control group consisted of patients with epilepsy who had not undergone brain surgery. Of the two control groups, the patients with epilepsy control group is similar to the experimental groups with respect to the type of disorder and medication taken by patients and, therefore, serves as a better control. The study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance to the guidelines of the local ethics committee. \n  \n Demographic and neuropsychological logical characteristics of the participants in the brain lesion study  . \n  \n##### Back-Pain control group \n  \nEight patients living with chronic lumbar back-pain were selected as control subjects as they suffered from a chronic medical condition that does not directly affect the central nervous system. \n\n\n##### Epilepsy control group \n  \nTen patients with epilepsy who had not undergone a neurosurgical procedure, nor thermal lesion were used as controls. These patients were on non-toxic AntiEpileptic Drug (AED) therapy at the time of the study, similar to the medication received by the brain operated patients, the difference being that the purpose was to control their epilepsy. None of the patients included presented clinical symptoms of medication toxicity. The antiepileptic drug therapy included one, two or three of the following: carbamazepine, primidone, valprolate, phenytoin, clonazepam, lamotrigine, vigabatrin, and barbiturate. The patients\u2019 presentations were not affected by seizures on the day of testing. \n\n\n##### Brain-operated groups \n  \nFourteen patients who underwent brain surgery in an attempt to alleviate refractory epilepsy are included here. The following exclusion criteria was used: Wechsler IQs below 75, psychiatric disorders, gross brain atrophy and left-handedness. Patients were tested 4\u201317 years after surgery. At the time of testing, all patients were on an anticonvulsant similar to those taken by the epilepsy control group. None of the patients presented any symptoms of drug toxicity (as assessed by a neurologist) and no patient had clinical or Electroencephalogram (EEG) seizures on the day of testing. \n\nThe anatomical landmarks used to identify patients\u2019 lesions have been outlined elsewhere (Bohbot et al.,  ). Patients with lesions were divided into two groups according to whether or not they had damage to the parahippocampal cortex. Hippocampal lesions include damage to the hippocampus proper, as well as the dentate gyrus, and the subicular complex. Damage to the parahippocampal cortex is characterized by damage to the posterior parahippocampal gyrus, the neo-cortical region posterior to the entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex. \n\n\n##### Right hippocampus \n  \nThis group consisted of five patients who had damage to the RH. Patient KJ had damage to the anterior portion of the hippocampus (Figure  ) and to the amygdala, and minor damage to the perirhinal cortex. Patient BS had a lesion to the right anterior and posterior parts of hippocampus, some damage to the right amygdala, and minor damage to the anterior portion of the right perirhinal cortex and the right inferior temporal neocortex. Patient FL had bilateral damage to the amygdala and damage to the right anterior hippocampus. Patient KP had a right hippocampal lesion, specifically damage to the anterior and posterior parts of the hippocampus and additional damage to the right amygdala only. Finally, Patient MJ had a right anterior lesion to the hippocampus with additional damage to the right amygdala only. None of the patients included in this group had any damage to the parahippocampal cortex. \n  \n Right hippocampal lesion  . MRI section in a coronal plane, zooming-in on the lesion to the right hippocampus (RH) of patient KJ (indicated with the arrow). This section was taken 12 mm posterior to the anterior commissure (  Y   = \u221212) in Talairach standard stereotaxic space (Talairach and Tournoux,  ). \n  \n\n##### Right parahippocampal cortex \n  \nAll five patients included in this group had damage to the right posterior parahippocampal cortex. Patient PP also had complete damage to the anterior part of the hippocampus, and partial damage to the following regions: posterior part of the hippocampus, amygdala, perirhinal and entorhinal cortices. Patient MJa had damage to both the anterior and posterior hippocampus, partial bilateral (but not symmetrical) damage to the amygdala and the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices were intact. PM had damage to the right parahippocampal cortex (RPH), anterior and posterior portions of the RH, the right amygdala, but no damage to the perirhinal cortex or entorhinal cortex. Patient PV had damage to the right anterior hippocampus and the right perirhinal cortex. Patient KrA had damage to the parahippocampal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex, but the RH was intact (Figure  ). \n  \n Right parahippocampal lesion  . MRI section in a coronal plane, zooming-in on the lesion to the right parahippocampal cortex (RPH) of patient PP (indicated with the arrow). This section was taken 30 mm posterior to the anterior commissure (  Y   = \u221230) in Talairach standard stereotaxic space (Talairach and Tournoux,  ). \n  \n\n##### Left hippocampus \n  \nThree patients, KS, SV, and VP, with lesions to the left hippocampus (LH) were included in this group, Patient KS presented with lesions in the left anterior hippocampus, left amygdala, and minor damage to the left entorhinal cortex and left perirhinal cortex. Patient SV had damage to the LH (posterior region), bilateral damage to the amygdala, and damage to the anterior portion of the left perirhinal cortex. Patient VP had a lesion to the left anterior and posterior regions of the hippocampus and the left amygdala was partially damaged. None of the patients included in this group presented with any damage to the parahippocampal cortex. \n\n\n##### Left parahippocampal cortex \n  \nOne patient, SI, had damage to the left parahippocampal cortex (LPH), as well as some damage to the left amygdala and left perirhinal cortex. \n\n\n\n#### Procedure \n  \nComputerized tasks were developed to assess patients\u2019 for two types of object information memory: changes in the spatial configuration of objects, and changes in the objects\u2019 identity. These computerized tasks were designed according to the oddball fashion for use with evoked potentials (Allen et al.,  ). The tasks were as follows: a standard display depicting five unrelated objects appeared on 80% of the trials (standards), and this standard display was altered on 20% of the trials (Figure  ). A new object appeared in place of one of the objects on the standard display on 10% of the trials (object identity change). On another 10% of the trials, the location of two of the objects from the standard display were switched (spatial configuration change). \n  \n Stimuli  . Example of one of the two sets of stimuli used showing the standard scene, spatial configuration change and object identity change. This stimulus set was used for either the spatial or object task, and another set of stimuli was used in the other task. \n  \nParticipants were asked to respond to spatial configuration changes on the spatial task (targets) and ignore the object identity changes (distractors). In the object task, participants were tested with a different set of stimuli and asked to respond to a change in object identity (target), while ignoring the changes in spatial configuration (distractors). Two sets of similar stimuli were developed. Each stimulus set could be used in either task, but for any given participant each stimulus set was used for only one task. The order of task presentation was counterbalanced. \n\nIn both the object and spatial tasks, five blocks of 50 displays of objects were presented. Each block of 50 was comprised of five sets of 10 displays, such that only one object change and one spatial configuration change occurred within each set of 10 displays. Each display was presented for a duration of 1496 ms, followed by a black screen for 2000 ms before the onset of the next display. For each trial, the participant\u2019s reaction time was recorded up to a maximum of 1500 ms. \n\n##### Spatial task \n  \nParticipants were instructed to press the left shift key when the standard scene was presented (occurred on 80% of the trials). When two of the five objects exchanged positions (spatial configuration change; occurring on 10% of trials), participants were instructed to press the right shift key. During this task, one of the objects was replaced by a novel object on another 10% of the trials (object identity change). Participants were instructed to ignore this object change and to press the left key. The keyboard was marked with the word \u201cspace\u201d on the right, and the word \u201cobject\u201d on the left in order to cue the participants. \n\n\n##### Object task \n  \nParticipants were instructed to press the left shift key when the standard scene was presented (80% of the trials). When one of the five objects was replaced by a novel object (object identity change), which happened 10% of the time, participants were instructed to press the right key. During this task, an exchange of the position of two of the objects (spatial configuration change) occurred on another 10% of the trials. The participants were instructed to ignore this spatial configuration change and to press the left key. The keyboard was marked with the word \u201cobject\u201d on the right, and the word \u201cspace\u201d on the left in order to cue the participants. \n\nIn summary, during either task, participants indicated their response by either pressing the left key for standards and distractors (\u201cNO\u201d response), or a right key for the targets (\u201cYES\u201d response). The participant\u2019s target detection was \u201ccorrect\u201d if the right key was pressed for the change in object identity during the object task, or if the right key was pressed for the change in configuration of objects in the spatial task. A response was incorrect if the right key was pressed for either the standards or irrelevant changes. \n\n\n\n#### Analysis \n  \nA non-parametric analysis of variance, the Kruskal-Wallis H test, was used to analyze the data as the assumption of a normal distribution cannot be made with small groups. The single patient with a left parahippocampal lesion was not included in any of the statistical analyses. One participant from the Epilepsy patient control (EPC) and one participant from the RH group (patient BS) were outside the distribution of the number of non-responses to standards, and over two standard deviations from the mean. The high number of non-responses to the standard situation was an indication that they were not participating in the task; they were therefore excluded from the analysis. Responses to the standard displays that followed the identity or spatial switch events were never included in the analyses, as these represented a change back to the standard condition. The five groups included in the analyses were: the back-pain control participants (BPC), the EPC participants, the RH, RPH, and LH groups. For both the object and spatial detection task, the Kruskal-Wallis test was performed on the correct \u201cYES\u201d responses divided by the total number of responses made (either to spatial or object changes). Statistical analyses were also performed on non-responses, \u201cNO\u201d responses to standard scenes, and slowing latencies to irrelevant changes. Further analysis was done with the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test for comparing two independent samples (two-tailed test). First, we compared the Back-Pain Control group to the Epilepsy Patient Control group. The Back-Pain Control group and the Epilepsy Patient Control group were then compared with each surgical patient group, and the group with lesions to the RH was compared to the group with lesions to the RPH. \n\n\n\n### Results \n  \nOn average, participants responded to 97.5% of the stimuli within the allotted time, and this rate of response did not differ by group for either the spatial task (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 8.24, df = 4, n.s.) or the object task (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 1.41, df = 4, n.s.). During both the object and spatial tasks, only the trials during which participants made a response were analyzed. Consequently, all the \u201cYES\u201d and \u201cNO\u201d responses added to 100% of the analyzed trials. A comparison of the five groups showed that participants\u2019 correct (\u201cNO\u201d) responses did not differ on standard scenes of the spatial task (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 2.63, df = 4, n.s.) or the object task (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 4.33, df = 4, n.s.), and since these are not of primary interest, they will not be discussed further. There were no group differences for the reaction times to object identity changes during the spatial task (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 0.50, df = 4, n.s.) or to spatial configuration changes during the object task (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 5.67, df = 4, n.s.). \n\n#### Spatial Task \n  \nThe right parahippocampal patients, and to some extent the right and LH patients showed poor discrimination of the spatial configuration from the object identity changes in the spatial task (Figure  ). In other words, patients with damage to the parahippocampal cortex answered \u201cYES\u201d to any change, whether spatial or object changes, showing no discrimination between the two. On the other hand, patients with damage to the RH and LH correctly responded \u201cYES\u201d more often to the spatial change, than to the object change. The detection of spatial configuration change (i.e., the \u201cYES\u201d response) was different across groups (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 17.71, df = 4,   p   < 0.001). The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test for two independent samples showed that performance of the two control groups did not differ significantly. The right parahippocampal participants were impaired relative to the control participants with epilepsy (  z   = 2.93,   p   < 0.005), and relative control participants with back-pain (  z   = 2.89,   p   < 0.005). The left and right hippocampal patients were impaired relative to the BPC (left:   z   = 1.98,   p   < 0.05; right:   z   = 2.33,   p   < 0.05); however, they were not impaired relative to the epileptic patient control participants (left:   z   = 1.48, n.s.; right:   z   = 0.85, n.s.). This implies that the left or right hippocampal lesion itself did not significantly increase the impairment resulting from the change in performance observed in participants with epilepsy. The lesion that included the RPH, however, did impair performance on this task. In addition, the group with lesions to the RPH was significantly impaired relative to the RH lesion group (  z   = 2.33,   p   < 0.05), thus showing that the impairment resulting from the RPH was dissociated from that of the RH. These results were previously reported elsewhere (Bohbot et al.,  ). \n  \n Spatial task  .

BPC: Back-Pain Control, EPC: Epilepsy Patient Control, LPH: Left Parahippocampal Cortex, LH: Left hippocampus, RPH: Right Parahippocampal Cortex, RH: Right Hippocampus. *Significantly different from the BPC group in responses to spatial changes (  P   < 0.05). **In responses to spatial changes, significantly different from the BPC and EPC groups (  P   < 0.005) and from the RH group (  P   < 0.05); in responses to the object changes, significantly different from the BPC (  P   < 0.01) and EPC (  P   < 0.05) groups. \n  \nWhile participants were engaged in the spatial task, there were significant differences (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 9.76, df = 4,   p   < 0.05) in the number of incorrect \u201cYES\u201d responses to the object identity change (distractors; Figure  ). The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test showed that only patients with damage to the RPH were impaired relative to the patient control group with epilepsy (  z   = 2.15,   p   < 0.05) and relative to the control group with back-pain (  z   = 2.59,   p   < 0.01). None of the other tested comparisons were significant. These results show that only the patients with lesions to the RPH were affected by the presence of distractors in the spatial task. \n\n\n#### Object Task \n  \nThere were significant differences in correct detection of the object identity change (\u201cYES\u201d responses) during the object task (Figure  ) across all groups (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 11.91, df = 4,   p   < 0.01). The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test showed that the two control groups were not different from each other and the right parahippocampal group was impaired relative to the back-pain control group (  z   = 3.01,   p   < 0.01) but not compared to the control participants with epilepsy (  z   = 1.91, n.s.). Patients with lesions to the RH or LH were not impaired on this task, either relative to the BPC or relative to the control participants with epilepsy. However, patients with lesions to the RPH were impaired relative to patients with right sided lesions to the hippocampus (  z   = 2.38,   p   < 0.05) suggesting that the right parahippocampal lesion itself was responsible for the impairment. It should be noted, however, that the performance of all but one participant in the right parahippocampal group ranged between 84% and 96% correct (see Figure  ) on the object identity task, which is in striking contrast to performance on the spatial configural task where the same patients scored an average of 35% correct, and thus the noted impairment has a small impact on the actual performance. \n  \n Object task  . Percent scores of correct detection of the object identity change (target), and incorrect detection of the spatial irrelevant change (distractor). Each bar represents the mean of a group. The scores of individual participants for each group are displayed. See legend of Figure   for the description of labels. *Significantly different from the BPC (  p   < 0.01) and the RH (  p   < 0.05) groups in responses to object changes. \n  \nThere were no differences (Kruskal-Wallis rank test,   H   = 3.03, df = 4, n.s.) in incorrect \u201cYES\u201d responses to the irrelevant spatial configuration change (distractors; see Figure  ). It should be noted that patients with lesions to the RPH were not affected by the distractors during the object task, which contrasts with the fact that they were severely affected by the distractors while performing the spatial task. These results show that the patients with lesions to the RPH were selectively impaired at the spatial task, with preserved performance in the object task. \n\n\n\n### Discussion \n  \nThe present experiment measured memory for object identity (learning which objects were part of a standard scene) and memory for the configuration of objects (learning the spatial arrangement of objects on the screen). Both of these tasks required participants to react to one kind of change and ignore the other, in order to avoid responses due solely to novelty. \n\nPatients with lesions to the RPH were impaired on the spatial task even when compared with epilepsy control participants and participants with lesions to the RH. They were largely unable to detect the spatial configuration changes, and responded equally to both the spatial configuration and object identity changes (Figure  ). The fact that patients with lesions to the RPH were impaired relative to patients with lesions to the RH indicates that the deficit resulting from the lesion in the parahippocampal cortex is unlikely simply to reflect a functional lesion in hippocampus. Thus, it suggests that the parahippocampal cortex plays a role in this spatial memory function above and beyond transmitting information to the hippocampus. \n\nPatients with lesions to the RH or LH were impaired relative to the back-pain control group, but not relative to the epilepsy control group on the spatial task. Despite their impairment, the patients with lesions to the hippocampus performed well (average 77% correct for the right and 60% correct for the left) compared to with patients in the right parahippocampal group (average 35% correct). A table-top task that assesses similar functions as our spatial task, was administered by Watson et al. ( ) to patients with lesions to the hippocampus. In this study, object was placed on a table-top and participants were asked to remember where the objects are located. After a 4 s blind delay, participants were asked to replace the objects in the correct relative positions. Patients with lesions to the hippocampus made significantly more \u201cswap\u201d errors, in which they often swapped the relative position of objects. At first, these findings appear inconsistent with the current study, in which patients with lesions to the hippocampus were not impaired at indicating when the spatial location of two objects was swapped. There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy. The first is that in Watson et al. ( ), the lesions were not specific to the hippocampus and the authors report that all three patients had varying degrees of damage to the temporal lobes. Although it is not specified in the study, it is highly likely that this also includes damage to the parahippocampal cortex. Therefore, the \u201cswap\u201d errors observed in Watson et al. ( ) may in part be related to damage to the parahippocampal cortex. The second reason for the discrepancy may be that in Watson et al. ( ), the comparison group was healthy controls, while in the current study, the comparison groups were other patients. If Watson et al. ( ) compared their sample to other patient groups, then their impairments may be less pronounced. The third is that, in Watson et al. ( ) the location of objects has to be reconstructed from memory, whereas in the current study, there is no \u201creconstruction\u201d required by the patients. Instead, patients are presented with images of objects, and they need to recognize when a swap has taken place. This interpretation is consistent with a paper by Stepankova et al. ( ) where patients with selective lesions to the hippocampus were impaired at reconstructing from memory the location of objects. In that 2004 study, patients were impaired despite the fact that swaps were taken into account, providing evidence for the role of the hippocampus in the construction of a cognitive map, of object locations in this case. In the current study, the significance in the comparison of the hippocampal groups in relation to the control group with back-pain indicates that the impairment is the result of factors related to both having epilepsy (i.e., medication, disorder, dysfunction of the medial temporal lobe etc.) and the thermal lesion. However, since there were no differences between the two groups with hippocampal lesions and the epilepsy control group, ascribing a possible deficit to the specific thermal lesion within the medial temporal region is not possible. We can therefore conclude that medial temporal areas, including the LH and RH are involved in this task, and that the remaining ability of the hippocampal groups, in the performance of the spatial task, can be accounted for by their intact parahippocampal cortex. \n\nAll of the patients (with RH or LH or parahippocampal cortex lesions) had comparable scores on the object task (Figure  ). If participants with thermal lesions to the RPH were poor at learning the spatial configuration of the objects, it is understandable that they successfully ignored these changes while performing the object task. The fact that they performed well on the object task (average 82% correct) compared with the spatial task (average 35% correct) indicates that they encoded the identity of objects during the task. Our data show that the deficits in patients with lesions to the RPH were severe for the spatial configuration but not for object identity. \n\n\n\n## Experiment 2: fMRI with Healthy Young Adults \n  \n### Materials and Methods \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nEight healthy young adults (mean age = 31.75 \u00b1 5.00; four women and four men) participated in the fMRI experiment. All participants were right handed and had normal vision. None of the participants had any history of neurological or psychiatric illnesses. Recruitment was done by word of mouth. The study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance to the guidelines of the local ethics committee. \n\n\n#### Procedure \n  \n##### Cognitive task \n  \nParticipants were presented with five objects on a projection screen; a new set of similar objects was used, relative to those presented in the patient study. On 10% of the trials, participants viewed a change in spatial locations of two of the objects (spatial configural change) and on another 10% of the trials one object were replaced by a new one (object identity change). For each set of five objects, the new object always remained the same (a sixth object). In the spatial task, participants were instructed to respond to spatial configuration changes (targets) and ignore the object identity changes (distractors). In the object task, participants were tested with a different set of stimuli and were asked to respond to a change in object identity (target), while ignoring the changes in spatial configuration (distractor). Consequently, participants view the same types of changes in both tasks, but they have to discriminate which changes they must respond to depending on whether they are engaged in the spatial configuration task or the object identity task. \n\n\n##### Control task \n  \nIn the control tasks, participants viewed the same objects as in the experimental tasks, but they were instructed to always press the same key so that no change needed to be detected. \n\n\n##### Neuroimaging \n  \nParticipants were scanned in a Siemens 1.5 T Scanner at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Participants were comfortably placed in the scanner with their heads immobilized with an air cushion. Prior to the functional scans, T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired to allow coregistration of functional and anatomical data. A three-dimensional gradient echo acquisition was used to collect 80 contiguous 2 mm T1-weighted images in the sagittal plane. Seven whole brain fMRI scans per participant were collected. Each functional scan consisted of 120 T2*-weighted image volumes acquired at 4 s intervals, giving a total duration of 8 min per scan. Each functional scan was acquired using 26 contiguous 5 mm axial slices positioned parallel to the hippocampus and covering the entire brain (TR = 4000 ms; echo   time   = 50 ms; field of view = 320 mm ; matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64; 120 whole brain acquisitions/run). Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal images were spatially smoothed (6 mm Gaussian kernel), corrected for motion, and linearly transformed into standard stereotaxic space (Talairach and Tournoux,  ) using in-house software (Collins et al.,  ). Each scan consisted of four blocs, each having (a) baseline control; (b) object or spatial task; and (c) baseline control, with different sets of stimuli for each of the blocs (see Figures  \u2013 ). During each bloc (the two baseline conditions and the experimental condition) 60 stimuli were presented with 1 s \u201con\u201d and 1 s \u201coff\u201d, thus a bloc had a duration of 2 min. Twenty-eight sets of stimuli were used, each following the same format so that one set of stimuli was used during only one bloc per subject. Each stimulus set could be used in either task, but for any given participant a stimulus set was used for only one task. The order of task presentation was counterbalanced and the order of bloc segments was randomized. The objects appearing in each of the 28 sets were randomized between participants. The data were analyzed by correlating a predicted hemodynamic response curve with the fMRI time-courses, using FMRISTAT (Worsley et al.,  ). This paradigm allowed us to contrast neuronal activity between the baseline scan and the spatial task or object task, and the two baseline scans before and after the experimental condition. Since the oddball appeared at random intervals within each 20 s period, an event-related fMRI analysis was done by comparing the hemodynamic responses to the object or spatial oddballs when presented as a targets or distractors. \n  \n Overall experimental design of the fMRI oddball task showing the control baseline condition before and after the experimental tasks  . \n    \n Overall experimental design of the fMRI oddball task showing the correct response that should be made by participants when viewing the standard condition, spatial and object change \u201coddball\u201d conditions  . \n    \n Detailed fMRI experimental design showing randomized oddballs within a semi-randomized block design showing the different sets of objects used for the different conditions  . \n  \nEach block involved visual presentation of a given display of five objects in 80% of the occurrences (standards; see Figure  ). Spatial configural changes from the standard display occurred in 10% of the presentations (i.e., two objects exchanged positions see Figure   and object identity changes occurred in 10% of the presentations (a 6th object replaced any one of the five in the display; see Figure  ). During the scans, participants responded to each visual display by 1-always clicking the left mouse button (baseline see Figure  ), 2-detecting the spatial changes with the right mouse button, or 3-detecting the object changes with the right mouse button, clicking on the left for all other non-target stimuli (see Figure  ). Stimuli were viewed for 1 s with 1 s inter-stimulus interval. There were four repetitions of Baseline-Task-Baseline per scan and seven scans per participant (totaling 28 repetitions; Figures  \u2013 ). Each repetition involved a unique set of objects (28 sets of objects). The order of conditions was presented in a semi-random fashion. Participants practiced before entering the scanner. Based on our   a priori   hypothesis, an uncorrected   p  -value of 0.001 was used for voxels in the predicted regions of interest (  N   = 8,   t   = 4.785), namely the parahippocampal cortex which we hypothesized to be involved in the spatial task based on the current experiment with brain lesioned patients, and the temporal and parietal cortices because of their well-known roles in processing information about object identity for the temporal cortex and visuo-spatial perception for the parietal cortex. A statistical   t  -threshold of 4.785 at   p   < 0.001 is similar to other studies that report parahippocampal activity (Goh et al.,  ; K\u00f6hler et al.,  ; Weniger et al.,  ; Howard et al.,  ; Morgan et al.,  ). For the whole brain, a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to calculate the   t  -statistical threshold at   p   < 0.05 (  N   = 8,   t   = 22.04). All peaks above 4.785 outside our regions of interest are reported, but they are not discussed since they do not cross the threshold for whole brain Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Regions close to the significant threshold for our regions of interest are also identified. \n\n\n\n\n### Results \n  \n#### Spatial Task \n  \nDuring the spatial memory configural task, there was an increase in activity in the RPH (  x   = 24,   y   = \u221238,   z   = \u221216;   t   = 3.79,   p   < 0.005) when this active condition (detection of spatial configural change) was contrasted to the active memory for object identity task (detection of the object identity change) (Figure  ). This finding is consistent with our original premise as well as the results from the experiment with the brain lesioned patients. There was also bilateral activation in the parietal cortex (left:   x   = \u221226,   y   = \u221256,   z   = 42;   t   = 8.32,   p   < 0.00005; right:   x   = 26,   y   = \u221260,   z   = 36;   t   = 8.64,   p   < 0.00005; Figure  ) and the right frontal cortex (Table  ). There was no significant difference in fMRI activity in the hippocampus between the spatial memory configural task and the object identity task. \n  \n (A)   fMRI results from the spatial memory configural task contrasted against the object identity task. Results are overlaid on the mean structural image. Hemispheres are indicated by L (left) and R (right).

(B)   fMRI results from the object identity task contrasted against the spatial memory configural task. Significant increase activity in the bilateral anterior temporal lobe (left:   x   = \u221246,   y   = 8,   z   = \u221234;   t   = \u22124.15,   p   < 0.005; right:   x   = 34,   y   = 0,   z   = \u221228;   t   = \u22123.99,   p   < 0.005). The negative values in the object identity task represent greater activity during that task when it was contrasted to the spatial task. \n    \n fMRI results from the spatial memory configural task contrasted against the object identity task  . \n  \n All areas showing positive (i.e., increases during the spatial configural task over the object identity task) and negative (i.e., increases during the object identity task over the spatial configural task) differences in activity between the two conditions are listed  . \n  \nWhen contrasting the two baseline conditions, before and after the spatial task for that specific set of stimuli, there were decreases in activity in the RPH (Figure  ; Table  ) (i.e., for the contrast of baseline after the spatial task minus baseline before the spatial task, for a given set of stimuli). This is interesting in the light of the fact that participants did not engage in any task during these baseline conditions and that the pattern of change that occurred in the contrast between these baseline conditions was different for the baseline conditions around the spatial task vs. those around the object task. \n  \n Contrast of baseline fMRI scans before and after the task for the two conditions showing task specific evidence of repetition suppression in the same areas of the brain required for learning the task  . Results are overlaid on the mean structural image. Hemispheres are indicated by L (left) and R (right).   (A)   fMRI results from the two baseline conditions, before and after the spatial task, contrasted against each other. After the spatial task, there was decreased in activity in the RPH (  x   = 32,   y   = \u221240,   z   = \u221216;   t   = \u22125.15,   p   < 0.001).   (B)   fMRI results from the two baseline conditions, before and after the object task, contrasted against each other. After the object task, there were decreases in activity in the left fusiform (  x   = \u221238,   y   = \u221248,   z   = \u221216;   t   = \u22126.34,   p   < 0.0005) and right parahippocampal cortex (  x   = 26,   y   = \u221242,   z   = \u221210;   t   = \u22124.72,   p   < 0.005). This is interesting in the light of the fact that participants did not engage in any task during these baseline conditions and that the pattern of change that occurred in the contrast between these baseline conditions was different for the baseline conditions around the spatial task vs. those around the object task. Note that the spatial configuration task and the object identity task were not included in these analyses. \n    \n Contrast of baseline conditions before and after the spatial task showing the decrease in fMRI activity in the parahippocampal cortex, among other areas  . \n  \n Brain areas showing changes in activity between the two baseline conditions. Positive values indicate an increase in fMRI activity in the second baseline condition, compared to the first baseline condition, for a specific set of stimuli. Negative values indicate a decrease in fMRI activity in the second baseline condition, compared to the first baseline condition, for a specific set of stimuli. Note that the spatial configuration task and the object identity task were not included in these analyses  . \n  \n\n#### Object Task \n  \nDuring the object task, there was activity in the anterior temporal lobes bilaterally (left:   x   = \u221246,   y   = 8,   z   = \u221234;   t   = \u22124.15,   p   < 0.005; right:   x   = 34,   y   = 0,   z   = \u221228;   t   = \u22123.99,   p   < 0.005; Figure  , Table  ). \n\nWhen contrasting the two baseline conditions, before and after the object task for that specific set of stimuli, there were decreases in activity in the left fusiform and RPH (Figure  ; Table  ). Interestingly, however, the decrease in left fusiform cortex activity was specific to the object identity condition. This is interesting in the light of the fact that participants did not engage in any task during these baseline conditions and that the pattern of change that occurred in the contrast between these baseline conditions was different for the baseline conditions around the spatial task vs. those around the object task. \n  \n Contrast of baseline fMRI scans before and after the object task showing the decrease in fMRI activity in the fusiform gyrus, among other areas  . \n  \n Brain areas showing changes in activity between the two baseline conditions. Positive values indicate an increase in fMRI activity in the second baseline condition, compared to the first baseline condition, for a specific set of stimuli. Negative values indicate a decrease in fMRI activity in the second baseline condition, compared to the first baseline condition, for a specific set of stimuli. Note that the spatial configuration task and the object identity task were not included in these analyses  . \n  \n\n\n### Discussion \n  \nAn increase in activity in the parahippocampal cortex was measured during the spatial task compared to the object task, thus supporting results obtained in the cognitive experiment discussed previously, showing that the parahippocampal cortex was critical for the spatial task in patients with specific lesions to the parahippocampal cortex. The behavioral response, task and visual presentation of the two baseline subtraction conditions were identical; yet, the spatial and object tasks administered between the two conditions modulated the activity of the parahippocampal cortex. In addition, the object task modulated the activity of the left fusiform gyrus more than the spatial task. Since patients with lesions to the RPH performed well on the object task, the left fusiform gyrus may have represented the information critical for the object identity task. These results provide further confirmation that the parahippocampal cortex is involved in acquisition and long-term changes related to the spatial configural task tested in the Oddball fashion. \n\nThe inferior parietal cortex was activated in healthy participants when they performed the spatial task in the fMRI scanner. Structurally and functionally, there are extensive connections between the parietal cortices and the parahippocampal cortex (Van Hoesen,  ; Blatt et al.,  ). Increased connectivity between the parahippocampal cortex and parietal cortices (specifically, the angular gyrus) has been found during tasks that require the identification of novel objects (Howard et al.,  ). It is possible that the inferior parietal cortex plays a role in recognizing changes in the spatial layout of the scenes presented. Ciaramelli et al. ( ) showed that the parietal cortex was specifically involved in egocentric navigation by showing that patients with damage to the posterior parietal cortex were specifically impaired in an egocentric route learning task, while allocentric navigation was spared. In addition, the inferior parietal cortex may play a role in bringing attention to details of the environment (Cabeza et al.,  ). Berryhill et al. ( ) showed that patients with bilateral damage to the inferior parietal cortex exhibited a deficit in autobiographical memory. Specifically, there was a deficit in richness of details when the patients freely recalled autobiographical memories. In the present study, there was activity in the inferior parietal cortex when participants were presented with a new spatial configuration. The activity in the inferior parietal cortex may be due to the attentional demands required when there is a specific change in spatial configuration. \n\nIt is interesting to note that, since our object task and spatial task were similar in perceptual stimulation (perception of five objects on a screen), the significant fMRI activity observed in the parahippocampal cortex (during the spatial task minus object task, or the contrast between the two baseline conditions) was a reflection of top down processing (not perceptually driven by the five objects). In other words, the differential activity measured between the two identical baseline tasks or the two active experimental tasks are likely to have represented the information processing relative to the instructions and not relative to the perceptual representation of the stimuli, since these were similar across all conditions. The fact that in one case there was an increase in fMRI activity in the parahippocampal cortex (in the contrast between the two active conditions) and that in the other case there was a decrease in fMRI activity in the parahippocampal cortex (in the contrast between the two baseline conditions) suggest that the changes in fMRI activity to identical perceptual features do not reflect any kind of habituation to the stimuli. As such, we conclude that activity measured in the parahippocampal cortex reflected top down processing. \n\nFurthermore, repetition suppression was previously reported in the literature when stimuli were repeatedly presented (Brozinsky et al.,  ; Epstein et al.,  ,  ). While repetition suppression typically refers to very rapidly presented stimuli, and is thought to reflect specific neuronal effects (reduced firing on the second of two rapid stimuli; Epstein et al.,  ) our data show different patterns of repetition suppression for the different tasks. This provides strong evidence that repetition suppression can come as a result of learning. In the literature, repetition suppression was observed in the parahippocampal cortex (Epstein et al.,  ,  ,  ). In Epstein et al. ( ), it was found that good navigators showed larger repetition effects than bad navigators suggesting that better learning had an impact on suppression of fMRI activity. These data suggest that repetition suppression can implicate a reduction of activity that occurs with learning. \n\n\n\n## General Discussion \n  \nThe combined results from these two studies highlight the importance of the parahippocampal cortex in spatial configural learning, independently from the hippocampus. Functional brain imaging experiments have implicated the parahippocampal cortex in different tasks requiring spatial processing. For example spatial navigation in a virtual, visual maze produced extensive activations of the parahippocampal cortex, bilaterally, in both fMRI (Brewer et al.,  ) and PET (Maguire et al.,  ) studies. Viewing scenes has also activated the parahippocampal cortex in fMRI experiments (Stern et al.,  ; Brewer et al.,  ; Epstein and Kanwisher,  ). Further, participants viewing a videotaped tour of houses displayed increased activation in the right parahippocampal gyrus when asked to recall spatial location or temporal order, but not object identity (Hayes et al.,  ). Interestingly though, it has been shown through a novel paradigm that the parahippocampal cortex is involved in the formation of contextual associations regardless of spatial information content (Aminoff et al.,  ). \n\nA systematic study of the components of a scene that elicit activity in the parahippocampal cortex revealed that the walls forming an indoor room, without objects, were sufficient to produce high activity in the parahippocampal cortex (Epstein and Kanwisher,  ) but that the spatial arrangement of objects or single objects was not sufficient for activation of the parahippocampal cortex. Interestingly, familiar landmarks, represented by buildings cut out from their background produced a signal in the parahippocampal cortex significantly higher than the response to household objects. This study strongly suggested that the parahippocampal cortex processes information related to places (Epstein and Kanwisher,  ). In support of this, on an fMRI task, Howard et al. ( ) found that activity in the parahippocampal cortex was related to the presentation of novel scenes. This function was separate from the hippocampus, which showed more selective activity to changes in the spatial relationship between objects and their background context. However, there are also alternate findings in the literature supporting a theory that the parahippocampal cortex also mediates contextual associations (Bar et al.,  ). In Janzen and van Turennout ( ), participants navigated through an environment in which objects were places at navigationally relevant (serving as landmarks) and non-relevant locations. Later on, when the objects were presented on their own, outside of the environment, the parahippocampal cortex was active only for objects that were navigationally relevant, even when the participant did not consciously recollect seeing the object. Our study showed that the parahippocampal cortex was critical for memory for the configuration of objects even without a background. Perhaps the memory component for the spatial arrangement of objects in our task involved the parahippocampal cortex in a way not needed during passive viewing of objects. The findings suggesting that the parahippocampal cortex responds to a landmark (e.g., building) and not an object (e.g., blender) support the idea that the spatial attribute of the stimuli tapped into the function of the parahippocampal cortex. \n\nIn another study, the magnitude of the parahippocampal activation was correlated with subsequent recollection of single scenes in a single event fMRI study, thus implicating the parahippocampal cortex in memory for scenes (Brewer et al.,  ). Imaging studies implicating the parahippocampal cortex in memory for scenes and lesion studies that show a dissociation between the parahippocampal cortex and the hippocampus support the hypothesis that the parahippocampal cortex itself can sustain memory. \n\nSeveral studies have noted the role of the retrosplenial cortex in spatial learning (Epstein and Higgins,  ; Epstein et al.,  ; Auger et al.,  ; Auger and Maguire,  ; Epstein and Vass,  ). However, in the current paradigm, we did not observe activity in the retrosplenial cortex. There are several reasons that may explain this discrepancy, one of which may be the low sample size. However, findings from the current fMRI study are consistent with behavioral findings from patients with lesions tested on the same paradigm, thus providing validity to our results despite the low sample size. An alternate explanation may be related to the function of the retrosplenial cortex. Although the exact role of the retrosplenial cortex is unclear, in Epstein and Vass ( ), the restrosplenial cortex is described as playing a role in localization and orientation in an environment. It is also described as playing a role in coding stable landmarks in an environment and storing spatial knowledge between well-traveled locations. The current paradigm does not require localization, orientation, or coding of permanent landmarks in an environment. Therefore, for this reason, we may not have observed activity in the retrosplenial cortex. \n\nThe studies of patients with thermal lesions have shown that both the RH and the RPH are important in spatial memory (Bohbot et al.,  ). The RPH seems to be involved in memory for spatial configuration of objects as well as memory for a location in an environment found during real space navigation. The hippocampus, on the other hand, seems to be involved in forming spatial relationships between environmental objects or landmarks in order to construct cognitive maps used in navigation (Iaria et al.,  ; Konishi et al.,  ). For example, the object location task that was sensitive to selective lesions to the hippocampus, sparing the parahippocampal cortex, required patients to construct a top-down view of the environment from their first person view experience; hence they had to generate a cognitive map (Bohbot et al.,  ). When the first person view is sufficient for navigation (i.e., they do not need to construct a top-down view in order to navigate), the parahippocampal cortex seems to be sufficient (Bohbot et al.,  ). While the current task required building spatial relationships, it did not necessarily require the construction of a cognitive map because one could learn the spatial configuration of stimuli by memorizing the spatial relations in a single scene (Bohbot et al.,  ; Brewer et al.,  ; Epstein and Kanwisher,  ). Furthermore, when tested in a dual solution task previously shown to be dependent on either the hippocampus or the caudate nucleus with fMRI (Iaria et al.,  ), patients with brain damage to the hippocampus are severely impaired at constructing cognitive maps (i.e., remembering the locations of target objects in relation to environmental landmarks; Bohbot et al.,  ). Interestingly, the parahippcampal cortex sends massive projections to both the hippocampus and caudate nucleus. Therefore, the parahippocampal cortex may provide the spatial information necessary for building stimulus-response relationships at the level of the caudate nucleus used for navigation (i.e., navigating by learning a sequence of specific motor behaviors such as a right or left turn, when reaching landmarks that act as stimuli; Packard et al.,  ; White and McDonald,  ), and in parallel, spatial information from the parahippocampal cortex may be processed by the hippocampus to form cognitive maps. Further research targeting such dissociations is necessary to delineate the specific spatial roles played by the parahippocampal cortex and the hippocampus. It is interesting to note that, in rats, larger hippocampal lesions are required to cause object recognition deficits than spatial memory deficits (Broadbent et al.,  ), suggesting in a different way, that the hippocampus is more critical for spatial memory than object recognition. The present results show that the parahippocampal cortex itself plays a critical role in spatial memory that can be dissociated from that of the hippocampus. The present experiment is also the first to reveal task specific repetition suppression associated with repetition of the baseline control condition in the very same region proven to be critical for learning the task in a brain-lesion study. The latter findings suggest a top-down, task specific modulation of repetition suppression in the parahippocampal cortex. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nExperimental design of the oddball task by JJBA and LN, experimental design of the fMRI study by SOD, VDB, AD, MP and ACE.

By relying on explicit behavioral instructions, only humans can use an acquisition shortcut that prospectively specifies how to yield intended outcomes under the appropriate stimulus conditions. A recent and largely unexplored hypothesis suggests that striatal areas interact with lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) when novel behaviors are learned via explicit instruction, and that regional subspecialization exists for the integration of differential response\u2013outcome contingencies into the current task model. Behaviorally, outcome integration during instruction-based learning has been linked to functionally distinct performance indices. This includes (1) compatibility effects, measured in a postlearning test procedure probing the encoding strength of outcome\u2013response (O\u2013R) associations, and (2) increasing response slowing across learning, putatively indicating active usage of O\u2013R associations for the online control of goal-directed action. In the present fMRI study, we examined correlations between these behavioral indices and the dynamics of fronto-striatal couplings in order to mutually constrain and refine the interpretation of neural and behavioral measures in terms of separable subprocesses during outcome integration. We found that O\u2013R encoding strength correlated with LPFC\u2013putamen coupling, suggesting that the putamen is relevant for the formation of both S\u2013R habits and habit-like O\u2013R associations. By contrast, response slowing as a putative index of active usage of O\u2013R associations correlated with LPFC\u2013caudate coupling. This finding highlights the relevance of the caudate for the online control of goal-directed action also under instruction-based learning conditions, and in turn clarifies the functional relevance of the behavioral slowing effect. \n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (doi:10.3758/s13415-014-0325-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nHigher animals, including humans, commonly learn novel behaviors via trial and error, by evaluating retrospectively whether an action performed under certain stimulus conditions yielded desirable outcomes. However, only humans are able to cut short this acquisition process by relying on explicit behavioral instructions that specify prospectively how to yield an intended outcome. This enables humans to directly yield the intended outcomes while circumventing potentially harmful trial-and-error learning (Doll, Jacobs, Sanfey, & Frank,  ). Although the great importance of this issue was acknowledged early on (Duncan, Emslie, Williams, Johnson, & Freer,  ; Luria,  ; Monsell,  ; Noelle,  ), the underlying mechanisms have still been little explored (Cole, Laurent, & Stocco,  ; Wolfensteller & Ruge,  ). Ultimately, learning by feedback and learning by instruction both enable the expression of goal-directed action by integrating anticipated response outcomes already during action selection. As a prerequisite, organisms need to learn that a certain outcome O is obtained by a certain response R (response\u2013outcome contingency) under the appropriate stimulus conditions (S). \n\n## Fronto-striatal interactions during instruction-based learning \n  \nUnder feedback-driven trial-and-error learning conditions, it is widely believed that distinct striatal substructures are important for establishing either outcome-directed (i.e., goal-directed) action relying on the anterior caudate or habit-like (i.e., directly stimulus-triggered) action relying on the putamen (Ashby, Turner, & Horvitz,  ; Dolan & Dayan,  ; Seger & Spiering,  ; Yin & Knowlton,  ). The picture gains complexity when considering that the striatum is not operating in isolation. Neuro-anatomically, it is clear that the striatum is heavily interconnected with the prefrontal cortex (PFC; Alexander, DeLong, & Strick,  ). Hence, one might expect that both areas engage interactively when learning and behavior is \u201cmodel-based\u201d rather than \u201cmodel-free\u201d in the sense that it is driven by explicit knowledge of contingencies stored in lateral PFC (LPFC) working memory (cf. Dolan & Dayan,  ; Glascher, Daw, Dayan, & O\u2019Doherty,  ). This view has recently been expressed in a few formal models on instruction-based control of learning and behavior (Doll et al.,  ; Huang, Hazy, Herd, & O\u2019Reilly,  ; Ramamoorthy & Verguts,  ). Moreover, recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that LPFC and striatal areas become functionally coupled when learning is under the control of explicitly instructed rules (Li, Delgado, & Phelps,  ; Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ). Such findings support the notion that model-based learning and model-free feedback-driven learning might share the same striatal machinery (cf. Daw, Gershman, Seymour, Dayan, & Dolan,  ; Doll, Simon, & Daw,  ). Furthermore, first evidence also suggests a similar striatal functional differentiation in that learning-related dynamics of LPFC\u2013anterior caudate coupling, but not LPFC\u2013putamen coupling, is sensitive to the manipulation of response\u2013outcome contingency during instructed stimulus\u2013response learning (Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ). Hence, specifically LPFC\u2013anterior caudate coupling seems to reflect processes linked to the integration of response\u2013outcome contingencies into an explicit model of the current task. \n\nThe primary aim of the present study was to further refine the functional interpretation of this basic finding regarding LPFC\u2013caudate coupling by interrelating functional connectivity measures with two distinct performance measures that have been identified in behavioral studies and might reflect distinct subprocesses of outcome integration during stimulus-based response selection. \n\nIn particular, it is commonly thought that goal-directed action selection is enabled by integrating outcomes via an S\u2013O \u2192 O\u2013R activation chain, both according to ideomotor theory and instrumental learning theory (Balleine & Ostlund,  ; de Wit & Dickinson,  ; Urcuioli,  ). In our previously reported experimental setup (Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ), it was impossible to decide whether the observed LPFC\u2013caudate coupling effects indicated O\u2013R association encoding by itself or rather the active usage of increasingly learned O\u2013R associations through the S\u2013O \u2192 O\u2013R chain. In the present study, we therefore added a test phase after each S\u2013R\u2013O learning phase, in which previous outcomes now served as imperative stimuli that required responses that could be either compatible or incompatible with the previously acquired O\u2013R associations. Thereby, we were able to obtain a relatively pure measure of O\u2013R association strength. \n\nAs in our previous design, S\u2013R\u2013O learning was induced via the introduction of differential response outcomes during instructed S\u2013R learning, which means that each distinct S\u2013R link was followed by a distinct outcome (Colwill & Rescorla,  ; de Wit & Dickinson,  ; Noonan, Mars, & Rushworth,  ; Shin, Proctor, & Capaldi,  ; Trapold,  ; Urcuioli,  ). Typically, in trial-and-error learning situations this \u201cdifferential outcome effect\u201d is evidenced by a more rapid decline of error rates from initial chance-level performance when comparing differential outcome conditions to common or random outcome conditions (Trapold,  ; Urcuioli,  ) and when the S\u2013R learning task is sufficiently demanding (Est\u00e9vez, Fuentes, Mari-Beffa, Gonz\u00e1lez, & Alvarez,  ; Legge & Spetch,  ). In instruction-based learning, which is characterized by an extremely low error rate from the start, this error rate effect clearly cannot serve as an adequate marker of outcome integration. But S\u2013R learning that is too easy to show any further benefit of differential outcomes on error rates is nevertheless associated with significant response-slowing across learning when compared to a common outcome condition (Ruge, Krebs, & Wolfensteller,  ). Analogous to the accelerated error rate decline in demanding trial and error learning situations, response slowing during instruction-based S\u2013R\u2013O learning can be interpreted as a putative index of active O\u2013R usage for the online control of goal-directed action selection. This is generally consistent with the notion that differential outcomes are rapidly integrated into an extended model of the current task instruction mediated via the \u201cfast-learning but slow-acting\u201d prefrontal cortex control system (cf. Dolan & Dayan,  ).  In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that such quickly established prefrontal S\u2013R\u2013O representations enable goal-directed action selection via functional couplings with the anterior caudate nucleus. \n\nBesides O\u2013R-related response slowing across S\u2013R\u2013O learning, which we suggest is indicative of active O\u2013R usage, numerous studies conducted in the realm of ideomotor theory (Greenwald,  ) have shown that the strength of O\u2013R encoding by itself is expressed in O\u2013R compatibility effects measured in a subsequent outcome-priming test phase (for a review, see Shin et al.,  ). Such O\u2013R compatibility effects are taken to indicate that perceiving a previous outcome activates automatically or unintentionally the action that it was previously produced by and that can be either compatible or incompatible with the current test-phase response requirements (Elsner & Hommel,  ; Shin et al.,  ). Importantly, this effect can be observed even after very short acquisition periods as in the present study (Ruge et al.,  ; Wolfensteller & Ruge,  ). The size of the O\u2013R compatibility effect can hence serve as an index of \u201cO\u2013R encoding\u201d analogously to previous fMRI studies based on the \u201csubsequent memory\u201d rationale, in which postlearning behavioral indices are correlated with brain activation recorded during learning (Brewer, Zhao, Desmond, Glover, & Gabrieli,  ; Summerfield et al.,  ). Hence, on the basis of this additional O\u2013R compatibility index we aimed to determine the specificity of the hypothesized LPFC\u2013caudate coupling for active O\u2013R usage rather than O\u2013R encoding by itself. Moreover, using a similar rationale, previous ideomotor learning studies reported activations in the hippocampus when extensively learnt response outcomes served as primes that should automatically trigger response tendencies consistent with previously established O\u2013R associations (Elsner et al.,  ; Melcher et al.,  ). Different from these studies that investigated highly overlearned O\u2013R associations, we hypothesized that hippocampal O\u2013R encoding under instruction-based learning conditions and especially during an early phase of learning might depend on the functional coupling with the LPFC (Huang et al.,  ). \n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nTwenty-eight human subjects participated in this study. Four of the subjects were excluded due to high error rates exceeding 25\u00a0% on the first unguided implementation trial (see below), suggesting that the instructions were not well memorized, thereby inducing a strong (undesired) trial-and-error learning component. An additional subject was excluded due to early abandoning of the experiment. The mean age of the remaining 23 subjects was 24.2, ranging between 18 and 31\u00a0years (12 female, 11 male). The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden in agreement with the World Medical Association\u2019s Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects gave written informed consent prior to taking part in the experiment and were paid \u20ac8 per hour or received course credit. \n\n\n### Materials and procedure \n  \n#### S\u2013R\u2013O learning phase \n  \nWe employed a modified version of our original instruction-based learning paradigm (Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ). Instructions were delivered via a \u201cguided implementation\u201d procedure in which the instruction was embedded within the first few behavioral implementation trials, which also comprised the presentation of differential outcomes following correct responses (see Fig.\u00a0 ). The guided implementation phase comprised 12 correct trials, including three repetitions of four distinct S\u2013R\u2013O triples (termed   S\u2013R\u2013O repetition   in the following discussion). A trial started with the presentation of the visual stimulus S for 500\u00a0ms. The visual stimuli were four distinct abstract shapes. Following 250\u00a0ms after S onset, an additional instruction stimulus (IS) was displayed, which remained on screen until a response was made or until timeout after 1,750\u00a0ms. The IS was a yellow square highlighting one of four constantly displayed empty boxes. The manual responses (left middle finger, left index finger, right index finger, and right middle finger) were mapped in a spatially compatible manner to the IS position. The differential outcomes were four distinct naturalistic sounds and were emitted for 500\u00a0ms directly following a correct response. This guided implementation phase was followed by an unguided implementation phase in which the IS was omitted, which comprised another 20 correct trials (i.e., five repetitions of the four distinct S\u2013R\u2013O triples). Hence, starting from the fourth S\u2013R\u2013O repetition, the correct response had to be retrieved from memory, since it was not indicated by the IS anymore. Erroneous trials were directly repeated in both learning phases, and the outcome was replaced by the German word for \u201cerror.\u201d The experiment comprised 11 such S\u2013R\u2013O learning blocks, each with novel visual stimuli and novel outcome sounds. The intertrial interval (ITI) was randomly selected from a distribution including interval durations of 800\u00a0ms (24 trials per block), 2,350\u00a0ms (five trials per block), and 4,700\u00a0ms (three trials per block). Analyses of learning-related changes in behavior and brain activation were based on SRO repetitions, with levels ranging between SRO-Rep1 and SRO-Rep8.   \nSchematic representation of the S\u2013R\u2013O learning phase. (A) Exemplary mapping between stimuli (visual shapes), instruction cues (colored squares), responses, and sound outcomes. During the experiment, subjects had to learn 11 different mappings, each involving novel visual stimuli and novel sound outcomes. (B) A novel S\u2013R\u2013O mapping was learned through explicit instruction provided by the instruction cues presented in the \u201cguided implementation phase,\u201d comprising the first three repetitions of each of the four S\u2013R\u2013O triples. During the \u201cunguided implementation phase\u201d (S\u2013R\u2013O Repetitions 4\u20138), instruction cues were no longer presented, and hence the correct response had to be retrieved from memory. \n  \n\n\n#### O\u2013R test phase \n  \nEach of the 11\u00a0S\u2013R\u2013O learning blocks was followed by a test phase probing the strength of the just-encoded O\u2013R associations, similar to the typical testing procedures used in the context of ideomotor theory (Shin et al.,  ). The previous outcome sounds were now serving as stimuli that again required one of the four responses (see Fig.\u00a0 ). The responses keys were the same as during the preceding S\u2013R\u2013O learning phase. Two outcome sounds were mapped to the response that had produced that sound in the preceding phase (  compatible   trials), whereas the two remaining outcome sounds were mapped to responses that had produced another sound before (  incompatible   trials). Hence, according to ideomotor theory, previously learned O\u2013R associations should prime the correct response in compatible trials, and the incorrect response in incompatible trials. As in the preceding S\u2013R\u2013O learning phase, the novel sound\u2013response mappings were learned via the two-step instruction procedure, comprising 12 guided and 20 unguided implementation trials. The instruction stimuli (ISs) were now the letters D, F, J, and K, presented centrally on the screen and mapped onto the left middle finger, left index finger, right index finger, and right middle finger, respectively. Different IS types were used in the learning and test phases, to deconfound O\u2013R and IS\u2013R compatibility. The nonspatial IS\u2013response mapping was practiced outside the scanner until performance accuracy was greater than 90\u00a0% in two consecutive blocks of 20 trials. A trial started with a fixation cross displayed for 500\u00a0ms, followed by the sound, lasting 500\u00a0ms. In the guided phase, the IS was presented 150\u00a0ms after sound onset and lasted until the response or until timeout after 1,500\u00a0ms. Accuracy feedback was displayed for 650\u00a0ms, indicating correct, wrong, or too-slow responses. The ITI distribution was the same as in the S\u2013R\u2013O learning phase. Note that the test-phase data were exclusively used to extract the behavioral O\u2013R compatibility index, based on the unguided implementation trials. This index then served as a covariate in the fMRI analysis of the S\u2013R\u2013O learning-phase brain activation data. Before entering the scanner, subjects completed one S\u2013R\u2013O learning block and one O\u2013R test block to familiarize them with the task procedure.   \nSchematic representation of the O\u2013R test phase. The four sound stimuli that had been produced by certain responses in the S\u2013R\u2013O learning phase now served as imperative stimuli in the test phase. The required response could be the same (compatible) or different (incompatible), with respect to the response that had produced that sound beforehand. The correct response was indicated by the instruction cues (letters D, F, J, and K) during the first three repetitions of each of the four sound\u2013response pairs. Starting from the fourth repetition, the correct response had to be retrieved from memory. Test-phase data were solely used to compute the size of the behavioral O\u2013R compatibility effect, as an index of O\u2013R strength, which was then correlated with the brain activation data collected during the preceding S\u2013R\u2013O learning phase. \n  \n\n\n\n### FMRI recording \n  \nWhole-brain images were acquired on a Siemens 3-T whole-body Trio System (Erlangen, Germany) with a 16-channel circularly polarized head coil. Headphones (MR-Confon) dampened the scanner noise and were used for sound presentation. Both structural and functional images were acquired for each subject. High-resolution structural images (1.0 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 1.0\u00a0mm) were acquired using an MP-RAGE T1-weighted sequence (TR = 1,900\u00a0ms, TE = 2.26\u00a0ms, TI = 900\u00a0ms, flip = 9\u00b0). Functional images were acquired using a gradient echo-planar sequence (TR =2,000\u00a0ms, TE =30\u00a0ms, flip =80\u00b0). Each volume contained 32 4.0-mm-thick slices (in-plane resolution 4.0 \u00d74.0\u00a0mm) plus 0.8-mm gap. Slices were oriented parallel to the AC\u2013PC plane. The experiment was controlled by E-Prime 2.0 software running on a Windows XP PC. Visual stimuli were displayed by an LCD projector on a back-projection screen mounted behind the magnet. Subjects viewed the screen through mirror glasses. A fiber-optic, light-sensitive keypress device was used to record subjects\u2019 behavioral responses. \n\n\n### fMRI preprocessing \n  \nThe fMRI data set was analyzed with SPM8 running under MATLAB 8.0.0.783. Preprocessing included slice-time correction, rigid body movement correction (three translation, three rotation parameters), and normalization of the functional images by directly registering the mean functional image to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) echo-planar-imaging template image provided by SPM8, with a resulting interpolated spatial resolution of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3\u00a0mm. Finally, images were spatially smoothed (Gaussian kernel, full width at half maximum = 8\u00a0mm). During model estimation, a temporal high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1/256\u00a0Hz was applied. \n\n\n### fMRI analysis \n  \n#### First-level analysis \n  \nFor the analysis of the functional couplings between LPFC and any other voxel in the brain, we used the psychophysiological interaction (PPI) framework implemented in SPM8 (Friston et al.,  ; Gitelman, Penny, Ashburner, & Friston,  ) in its generalized form proposed recently (McLaren, Ries, Xu, & Johnson,  ). Essentially, the PPI method predicts the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal time course in \u201ctarget\u201d voxels anywhere in the brain volume, on the basis of the BOLD signal time course in a prespecified \u201cseed\u201d voxel. Importantly, functional coupling is not simply defined by a significant regression between two BOLD signal time courses, but it is defined in terms of changes in regression slopes as a function of varying psychological states associated with two experimental conditions A versus B. The generalized PPI used here accommodates situations in which the two contrasted conditions are occurring in the context of additional experimental conditions intermixed with the conditions of interest. For each experimental condition two regressors were included in a generalized linear model (GLM). This includes a standard event-related regressor obtained by convolving a canonical BOLD response model with a stick function representing the repeated occurrences of that condition. This \u201ctask regressor\u201d picks up the average event-related BOLD activation level associated with that condition. The second regressor is obtained by multiplying the task regressor with the seed voxel activation time course (by first deconvolving the seed voxel activation time course, then multiplying with the task-related stick function, and then reconvolving with the canonical BOLD response, all as described by Gitelman et al.,  ). In linear combination with the task regressor, this \u201cPPI regressor\u201d picks up any trial-to-trial deviation from the mean task-related activation that is common between seed voxel and target voxel. Hence, the PPI regressor measures task-related synchrony between the seed-voxel and target-voxel activation time courses, which defines the term \u201cfunctional coupling\u201d used in the present article. Finally, the GLM comprises the seed voxel time course as an additional regressor to bind unspecific sources of covariance between seed voxel and target voxel. In the present study, we analyzed PPI regressor estimates for early learning trials (SRO-Rep2 and SRO-Rep3) and late learning trials (SRO-Rep7 and SRO-Rep8). Note that we did not include SRO-Rep1 within the category of early learning trials as this was considered to be a very special condition comprising a strong perceptual novelty component due to the fact that visual stimuli and sounds were perceived for the very first time. Hence, we considered SRO-Rep2 and SRO-Rep3 to be more \u201cneutral\u201d instances of early learning trials. \n\n\n#### Second-level analysis \n  \nThe primary goal of the present study was to determine possible correlations between the two putative behavioral measures of O\u2013R encoding strength and O\u2013R usage, on the one hand, and the functional coupling between lateral PFC and other brain structures, on the other hand. We therefore included both behavioral indices as covariates in the group-level analysis of PPI effects. By simultaneously including both covariates, we made sure that a correlation between PPI effect and one covariate was uniquely driven by a covariance component that was orthogonal to the other covariate. In other words, we determined partial correlations between the PPI effect and one covariate, with the potential influence of the other covariate being regressed out. Note that this procedure does not exclude the possibility that both covariates might be significantly correlated with the same PPI effect in the same target voxel. Yet, these correlations would then be due to different covariance sources. To make sure that we would not miss any significant correlation due to covariance components common to both covariates, we additionally computed group-level analyses that comprised only one of the two covariates, respectively (to foreshadow the results: We did not observe such additional effects). Furthermore, we ran complementary control analyses that included error rate changes across learning as an additional covariate (see below, Step 3 of the analysis). \n\nThe covariance analysis proceeded in three steps. We first identified for each covariate significant correlations with the PPI effect defined by the difference in functional couplings in late learning trials relative to early learning trials. Significant activations were required to exceed a family-wise-error (FWE) threshold   p   < .05, adjusted for the volume of each selected region of interest (ROI) either on the voxel level or on the cluster level at a cluster-forming threshold of   p   < .001 (see below for our ROI selection). To search for significant effects outside of the preselected ROIs, we also computed FWE-corrected whole-brain statistics. \n\nIn a second step, we performed post-hoc tests to determine whether a significant activation identified in Step 1 was linked to correlations between the behavioral covariate and functional couplings in early learning trials, mid learning trials (SRO-Rep5 and SRO-Rep6), and late learning trials. \n\nIn a third step, we ran two complementary control analyses including the subject-wise error rate difference between the late and early learning trials as an additional covariate, either in combination with the covariate for O\u2013R encoding strength or in combination with the covariate for O\u2013R usage. These final analyses were performed in order to control for potential confounding effects between the indices for O\u2013R encoding strength and O\u2013R usage, on the one hand, and error rate differences across S\u2013R\u2013O learning, on the other hand. Even though the mean error rates early and late in learning were low (1.8\u00a0% and 4.8\u00a0%, respectively, and given an error rate of 75\u00a0% for chance performance), this control analysis nevertheless seemed warranted, since error rates varied considerably across subjects (ranging between 0\u00a0% and 9\u00a0% early and between 0\u00a0% and 14\u00a0% late). \n\nOne possible confounding might be that relative response slowing was directly related to difficulties in instructed S\u2013R translation rather than to the extent of increasing O\u2013R usage. Accordingly, higher error rates late in learning could potentially be associated with slower responding due to higher uncertainty about which response alternative to select given a particular stimulus (since the correct response might not yet be recalled with certainty). \n\nAnother possible confounding might be that functional couplings associated with O\u2013R encoding strength might primarily engage in error-driven S\u2013R learning, which might as a side effect also drive O\u2013R learning (possibly even elsewhere in the brain). \n\n\n#### Regions of interest \n  \nAnalogously to Ruge and Wolfensteller ( ), and in line with other studies on instruction-based learning (Dumontheil, Thompson, & Duncan,  ; Hartstra, Kuhn, Verguts, & Brass,  ), the left posterior LPFC was selected as a seed region (MNI coordinates: \u201342 8 32). Likewise analogously to Ruge and Wolfensteller ( ), this voxel was selected on the basis of a standard univariate analysis that identified the strongest learning-related activation changes within posterior LPFC via an   F   test computing the main effect across all eight S\u2013R\u2013O repetition levels, with   p  (  F  ) < .05, FWE-corrected on the whole-brain level. \n\nWe looked for significant PPI effects in three ROIs, including most importantly the left and right basal ganglia as the regions of primary theoretical interest. Additionally, we included the left and right hippocampus, which has been reported in previous studies on instruction-based control (Li et al.,  ; Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ) and has been suggested to play a critical role in such processes in a formal neurocomputational model (Huang et al.,  ). As a third ROI, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was included, defined by Brodmann areas BA11 and BA47. We included this region because previous studies had suggested its importance in goal-directed action control (e.g., Noonan, Kolling, Walton, & Rushworth,  ; Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ; Valentin, Dickinson, & O\u2019Doherty,  ). Anatomical information was taken from the automatic anatomic labeling atlas (AAL) for the basal ganglia and hippocampus (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al.,  ) and from the Brodmann parcellation used in the MRICRON software for the OFC ROI (Rorden, Karnath, & Bonilha,  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavior (S\u2013R\u2013O learning phase) \n  \nWe computed two separate one-way repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with the factor S\u2013R\u2013O Repetition (SRO-Rep1 through SRO-Rep8) for mean response times (RTs) and mean error rates using SPSS 21. The analyses revealed highly significant S\u2013R\u2013O repetition effects for both RTs [  F  (3, 63) = 67.3,   p  (  F  ) < .001, Greenhouse\u2013Geisser corrected] and errors [  F  (3, 70) = 15.1,   p  (  F  ) < .001, Greenhouse\u2013Geisser corrected]. As expected, we observed a sharp drop in RTs from SRO-Rep1 to SRO-Rep2, likely reflecting a strong \u201corienting response\u201d upon the introduction of novel stimuli at SRO-Rep1 (see Fig.\u00a0 ). This was followed by a slight RT increase at SRO-Rep4, indicating the transition into the unguided phase, in which responses had to be selected on the basis of memorized S\u2013R association from the preceding guided learning phase. Then, RTs gradually declined until SRO-Rep8. The learning curve for error rates is mainly characterized by a sharp increase in errors at SRO-Rep4, again indicating the transition into memory-based response selection. Notably, the group mean was 11\u00a0% errors at SRO-Rep4, which quickly dropped down to 5\u00a0% (see Fig.\u00a0 ). This indicates that the S\u2013R instruction was well learned, given an expected error rate of 75\u00a0% for chance-level performance, due to the four independent and equally probable response choices. The subject-wise behavioral index of active O\u2013R usage entered into the fMRI covariance analysis was defined as the individual RT difference between late learning trials (the mean of SRO-Rep7 and SRO-Rep8) and early learning trials (the mean of SRO-Rep2 and SRO-Rep3). Note that on the mean group level, a significant mean response speed-up was indicated by a negative mean difference between SRO-Rep7/8 and SRO-Rep2/3. Hence, as in previous experiments (Ruge et al.,  ), the O\u2013R-related relative slowing effect was supposed to be embedded in a general speeding effect. This overall speeding effect likely reflects increasingly fluent S\u2013R translation associated with decreasing error rates, which indicates decreasing response uncertainty as fewer response alternatives have to be considered (see also the third step of the second-level fMRI analysis, in the   section).  To determine the extent to which intersubject variability in response slowing might in fact be due to variability in the S\u2013R-related speed up rather than in O\u2013R-related slowing, we computed the correlation between the RT differences (late \u2013 early) and the error rate differences (late \u2013 early). This correlation was, however, close to zero, with   r   = .033 (  p   < .88, two-sided), suggesting that variability in response slowing cannot be reduced to the degree of uncertainty in S\u2013R translation, expressed in error rates. In fact, this nonsignificant result might be due to the relatively tiny error rates and error rate changes from early to late in learning, which might hence affect RTs only very marginally.   \nBehavioral data from the S\u2013R\u2013O learning phase. The solid line represents mean response times (RT), and the dashed line represents mean percent error rates. Correct responses were guided by an instruction cue in S\u2013R\u2013O Repetitions 1\u20133. The instruction cue was omitted in S\u2013R\u2013O Repetitions 4\u20138. \n  \n\n\n### Behavior (test phase) \n  \nWe computed two one-sided paired   t   tests to determine the O\u2013R compatibility effect (incompatible > compatible) for RTs and mean error rates collected during the unguided test phase. The analyses revealed highly significant O\u2013R compatibility effects for RT [  t  (22) = 3.1,   p  (  t  ) < .005] and a just-significant effect also for errors [  t  (22) = 1.7,   p  (  t  ) < .05]. The subject-wise behavioral index of O\u2013R encoding strength that entered the fMRI covariance analysis was defined as the individual O\u2013R compatibility effect in RT. The correlation between the O\u2013R compatibility effect in the test phase and SRO-related response slowing during the preceding S\u2013R\u2013O learning phase was not significant (  r   = \u2013.28,   p  (  r  ) < .20, two-sided). Notably, this is a deviation from previous results, in which we did find significant positive correlations between slowing and the subsequent O\u2013R compatibility effect (Ruge et al.,  ). Currently, it remains elusive which of the various design differences between the present study and the previous study might be responsible for the diverging results. \n\nWe also computed the correlation between O\u2013R compatibility effect and the error rate difference during learning, to assess the potential confound between feedback-driven S\u2013R learning and O\u2013R encoding (see also the third step of the second-level fMRI analysis, in the   section). This correlation was positive but nonsignificant, with   r   = .32 (  p   < .14, two-sided), suggesting that the O\u2013R compatibility effect was not substantially related to uncertainty in S\u2013R translation, expressed in the error rates. Note that during the fMRI analysis we nevertheless performed a control analysis including error rate as an additional covariate, to partial out any common covariance between O\u2013R compatibility, error rate difference, and brain activation. \n\n\n### fMRI \n  \nWe first assessed general changes in functional couplings with the LPFC seed from early to late S\u2013R\u2013O learning trials. This analysis replicated previous findings by Ruge and Wolfensteller ( ). Specifically, we found increasing functional couplings between LPFC and anterior caudate, as well between LPFC and OFC (Table\u00a0 ).   \nFunctional coupling with LPFC during S\u2013R\u2013O learning (late > early) \n  \n\nThe analysis of primary importance assessed potential correlations between changes in LPFC couplings and the two behavioral covariates. A learning-related increase in the functional coupling between LPFC and bilateral anterior caudate was positively correlated with response slowing as the putative maker of active O\u2013R usage, but not with the O\u2013R compatibility effect as a putative marker of O\u2013R encoding (see Table\u00a0  and Figs.\u00a0  and  ). The positive correlation between response slowing and LPFC\u2013caudate coupling evolved during learning, with a significant effect late in learning but no significant effect early in learning. This pattern was confirmed by a median split sorting subjects into two groups according to the size of the O\u2013R usage index (Fig.\u00a0 ). Moreover, the same correlational pattern was observed for the left posterior hippocampus (note that a similar, but nonsignificant, effect was observed in the homologous right posterior hippocampus). Supplementary Table\u00a0  additionally includes the correlation coefficients for the association between response slowing and functional couplings for mid learning trials in relation to early and late learning trials. For all identified areas, this complementary analysis demonstrates a gradual increase from early to late with mid-learning correlations always lying between these two values. This means that the observed effects were not just driven by differences in functional couplings between guided (SRO-Rep1/2/3) and unguided (SRO-Rep4/5/6/7/8) learning trials, which might have been potentially associated solely with differences in S\u2013R retrieval demands.   \nCorrelation between O\u2013R usage during S\u2013R\u2013O learning and functional coupling with LPFC during S\u2013R\u2013O learning (late > early) \n  \n p   < .05;   p   < .01;   p   < .001; (n.s.) not significant \n    \nVisualization of the results obtained by the left lateral-prefrontal-cortex-seeded (MNI \u201342 8 28) psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis, comparing interregional couplings in late learning trials (mean S\u2013R\u2013O Repetitions 7 and 8) and in early learning trials (mean S\u2013R\u2013O Repetitions 2 and 3). Voxels colored in blue (Putamen and anterior Hippocampus) depict significant correlations across subjects between the PPI effect and the behavioral index of O\u2013R encoding strength. Voxels colored in red (anterior Caudate and posterior Hippocampus) depict significant correlations between the PPI effect and the behavioral index of active O\u2013R usage. For visualization purposes, the images were thresholded at   p   < .005 uncorrected. \n    \nSummary of the results obtained by the left lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC)-seeded (MNI \u201342 8 28) PPI analysis for two exemplary clusters exhibiting significant correlations with the behavioral indices of either active O\u2013R usage (i.e., RT slowing; red/light grey in print) or O\u2013R encoding strength (i.e., O\u2013R compatibility effect; blue/dark grey in print). (A) Scatterplots depict correlations between the behavioral indices and the gPPI effects for late versus early learning trials. (B) The bar graphs depict the size of the gPPI effects in early and late learning trials, shown separately for two groups of subjects defined by median splits according to O\u2013R usage (left) and O\u2013R encoding strength (right). \n  \n\nIn contrast to O\u2013R usage, O\u2013R encoding strength by itself (i.e., size of the postlearning O\u2013R compatibility effect) was correlated with a different set of functional couplings, and this correlation was structured in a completely different way (see Table\u00a0  and Figs.\u00a0  and  ). Specifically, O\u2013R encoding strength was negatively correlated with LPFC\u2013putamen functional coupling late in learning, and additionally positively correlated with LPFC\u2013putamen functional coupling early in learning. Again, this pattern was confirmed by a median split sorting subjects into two groups according to the size of the O\u2013R encoding-strength index (Fig.\u00a0 ). The same correlational pattern was also observed for the left and right anterior hippocampi. Supplementary Table\u00a0  additionally includes the correlation coefficients for the association between O\u2013R compatibility and functional couplings for mid learning in relation to early and late in learning. For all identified areas, this complementary analysis demonstrates a gradual decrease from early to late, with mid-learning correlations always lying between these two values. Again, this means that the observed effects were not primarily driven by differences in functional couplings between guided (SRO-Rep1/2/3) and unguided (SRO-Rep4/5/6/7/8) learning trials.   \nCorrelation between O\u2013R strength and functional coupling with LPFC during S\u2013R\u2013O learning (late > early) \n  \n p   < .05;   p   < .01;   p   < .001; (n.s.) not significant \n  \n\nFinally, we found no significant correlation between the behavioral indices and learning-related BOLD activation in striatal or orbitofrontal areas without considering their functional coupling with LPFC. A direct correlation with O\u2013R strength was observed only for the most dorsal section of the left and right hippocampi [MNI \u201318 \u201337 1 and MNI 21 \u201334 4,   t   = 4.78;   p  (FWE) < .015 and   t   = 7.1,   p  (FWE) < .001]. But these hippocampal activation clusters were entirely nonoverlapping with the posterior hippocampal regions that exhibited a correlation between LPFC coupling and O\u2013R usage. \n\n\n### Control analyses \n  \nTwo additional analyses were performed in order to exclude the possibility that any of the above reported correlations between functional couplings and the behavioral indices of O\u2013R usage and O\u2013R encoding strength might equally well be explained by interindividual differences in error rates related to S\u2013R learning (see also the third step of the second-level fMRI analysis in the   section). In general, the opposite seems to be true. Simultaneously entering response slowing and error rate difference (late vs. early) as covariates slightly increased rather than decreased the   t   values for the response-slowing covariate (Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). The error rate covariate did not reach significance after small-volume FWE correction. Simultaneously entering the two covariates O\u2013R compatibility and error rate difference (late vs. early) substantially increased rather than decreased the   t   values for the O\u2013R compatibility covariate (Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). This suggests that interindividual differences in error rates and O\u2013R compatibility effects bind different variance components in the relevant brain areas that would otherwise be part of the residual, and hence would reduce   t   values. This interpretation is further corroborated by the finding that the error rate difference (late vs. early) significantly correlated with the learning-related coupling between LPFC and areas within putamen and anterior hippocampus that are highly similar to those found for the O\u2013R compatibility covariate (Table\u00a0 ).   \nCorrelation between S\u2013R error rate and functional coupling with LPFC during S\u2013R\u2013O learning (late > early), controlled for O\u2013R encoding strength \n  \n p   < .05;   p   < .01;   p   < .001; (n.s.) not significant \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study was set up to characterize the relationship between behavioral and neural indices of model-based (here: instruction-based) learning of novel goal-directed actions. Specifically, by combining the two data modalities, we aimed to gain novel insights about possible subprocesses of integrating O\u2013R contingencies into the current task model that are difficult to obtain by separately assessing behavioral and neural data in isolation. One specific focus was on the anterior caudate, a region implicated in goal-directed behavior in feedback-driven learning situations (O\u2019Doherty et al.,  ; Tanaka, Balleine, & O\u2019Doherty,  ; Tricomi, Delgado, & Fiez,  ) and tightly coupled to the LPFC in instruction-based learning situations, especially with high rather than low O\u2013R contingency (Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ). \n\nIn the present study, we found clear indication that active O\u2013R usage (increasing response slowing across S\u2013R\u2013O learning) was specifically associated with increasing learning-related functional coupling between the LPFC and anterior caudate. By contrast, O\u2013R encoding strength by itself (test-phase O\u2013R compatibility effect in response times) was linked to the coupling between LPFC and putamen (i.e., the rodent dorsolateral striatum), which constitutes the putative striatal subdivision held to be responsible for habit formation (Balleine & Ostlund,  ; Yin & Knowlton,  ) at least during intermediate stages of automatization (Ashby et al.,  ). Similar to the functional differentiation of striatal couplings with the LPFC, we also found distinct hippocampal areas that were coupled with LPFC as a function of either O\u2013R usage (posterior hippocampus) or O\u2013R encoding strength (anterior hippocampus). \n\nImportantly, none of the mentioned correlations between LPFC-seeded couplings and O\u2013R encoding strength or O\u2013R usage could be reduced to interindividual variability in S\u2013R learning as indexed by error rates. On the contrary, variability in S\u2013R learning and variability in O\u2013R learning seem to be independently associated with couplings between LPFC and almost identical locations in putamen and hippocampus under instruction-based learning conditions. Thus, although S\u2013R learning and O\u2013R learning seem to share common neural substrates, the engagement of these shared neural resources for S\u2013R learning and O\u2013R learning is dissociated across subjects (e.g., a good early S\u2013R learner is not necessarily a good early O\u2013R learner and vice versa). This independence of correlations might be surprising on the one hand, as O\u2013R learning can be regarded as being closely related to S\u2013R learning (cf. Balleine & Ostlund,  ). In both cases a mental representation of a stimulus becomes associated with a response. However, on the other hand, it is also clear that additional sources of variability might affect O\u2013R learning even though the O is essentially also just a stimulus. First, the S in S\u2013R learning is sensorially present prior to responding whereas the O is only mentally represented prior to responding. Second, to become mentally represented in the first place, the O needs be retrieved through S\u2013O associations that must have been learned beforehand. Both aspects might add across-subjects variability specifically in O\u2013R learning that is not present in S\u2013R learning. \n\nAnother important observation is that, without considering functional couplings to the LPFC, neither caudate nor putamen were correlated with the behavioral indices of O\u2013R strength or O\u2013R usage, respectively. This is generally a crucial point to make as the striatal dependency on LPFC activation is exactly what is expected for theoretical reasons when learning is based on an explicit model of O\u2013R contingencies temporarily being stored in the LPFC (Doll et al.,  ; Doll et al.,  ; Ramamoorthy & Verguts,  ). However, it should be noted that the type of connectivity analysis chosen here does not warrant unequivocal statements about causal relationships. Hence, it might well be that the functional couplings between LPFC and striatal areas are in fact driven by common input from other areas. For instance, O\u2013R learning might take place in the putamen as well as in the LPFC, but both might be only indirectly coupled via a common driving input from S\u2013O encoding processes that might possibly be mediated by orbitofrontal regions, especially for nonincentive outcomes like the ones employed in the present study (Clark, Hollon, & Phillips,  ; McNamee, Rangel, & O\u2019Doherty,  ). \n\nFurthermore, the observed fronto-striatal couplings were not only differentially correlated with O\u2013R usage and O\u2013R encoding, but the temporal structure of these correlations was entirely different. O\u2013R usage was positively correlated with LPFC\u2013caudate coupling late in learning but not yet early in learning. This might simply suggest that it takes a few learning cycles before the full S\u2013R\u2013O contingency model is being integrated into caudate-based action selection processes. These \u201cfew learning cycles\u201d do not seem to be directly related to our O\u2013R encoding index, which was neither correlated with the behavioral O\u2013R usage index nor modulated the correlation between O\u2013R usage and LPFC\u2013caudate coupling. Hence, although it is a necessary element in the putative S-O \u2192 O\u2013R chain, successful O\u2013R encoding alone is not sufficient for O\u2013R usage. \n\nThe correlational dynamics regarding LPFC\u2013putamen coupling were different. Specifically, O\u2013R encoding strength was negatively correlated with LPFC\u2013putamen coupling late in learning and additionally positively correlated with LPFC\u2013putamen coupling early in learning. This seems to suggest that good O\u2013R learners (indicated by strong O\u2013R compatibility effects) benefited from an early boost in LPFC\u2013putamen coupling leaving quite some time for subsequent O\u2013R consolidation. By contrast, the late boost of the same couplings in weak O\u2013R learners might imply less remaining time for O\u2013R consolidation, which in sum results in relatively poorly encoded O\u2013R associations. Interestingly, the LPFC showed a similar temporal pattern of couplings with quite similar areas in the putamen (and anterior hippocampus, for that matter) as a function of the error rate difference between late and early stages in learning. Specifically, when the error rate was relatively high late (i.e., small error rate difference relative to early learning trials), LPFC\u2013putamen coupling was relatively weak early and relatively strong late. By contrast, when the error rate was relatively low late, LPFC\u2013putamen coupling was relatively strong early and relatively weak late. Together this suggests that the LPFC\u2013putamen coupling increases whenever S\u2013R learning is ongoing. In some subjects, S\u2013R learning occurs early (accompanied by strong coupling) resulting in strongly reduced error rates late (accompanied by weak coupling). Other subjects show weak S\u2013R learning early (accompanied by weak coupling) and have to catch up with S\u2013R learning late (accompanied by strong coupling). \n\n### Specificity of LPFC\u2013anterior caudate functional couplings \n  \nTogether, the present findings clearly suggest that the functional coupling between LPFC and anterior caudate is specifically linked to active O\u2013R usage rather than O\u2013R encoding by itself. Our findings go beyond previous studies that demonstrated an involvement of anterior caudate in instruction-based learning but did not look into possible functional couplings (Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ; Stocco, Lebiere, O\u2019Reilly, & Anderson,  ), or that demonstrated functional couplings between PFC and caudate but did not establish a clear link with the expression of overt goal-directed behavior (Li et al.,  ; Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ). It is interesting to note that the observed correlation between O\u2013R usage and LPFC-seeded functional coupling was located rather dorsally in the anterior caudate (  z   = +4). This corresponds roughly to a \u201cdorsal striatum\u201d region (  z   =0) that has previously been interpreted to be relevant for linking predicted outcomes to actions under trial-and-error learning conditions (O\u2019Doherty et al.,  ). By contrast the same previous study implicated the \u201cventral striatum\u201d region (  z   = \u201310) in stimulus-based outcome prediction. In the present study the ventral striatum (  z   = \u20138) exhibited a generally increased learning-related coupling with the LPFC without being modulated by O\u2013R usage. Hence together, this might suggest that S\u2013O prediction supported by the ventral anterior caudate region is relatively stable across subjects and only action selection based on that predicted outcome varies considerably between subjects. \n\nGenerally, the convergence of results between trial-and-error learning and instruction-based learning highlights the strikingly similar functional differentiation within the anterior striatum. Yet, the important distinction seems to be that in the latter case it emerges through functional coupling with the LPFC. \n\n\n### Stimulus\u2013response associations, outcome\u2013response associations, and the habit concept \n  \nThe putamen is typically thought to be part of the habit system (Ashby et al.,  ; Dolan & Dayan,  ; Seger & Spiering,  ; Yin & Knowlton,  ). Accordingly, the association between LPFC\u2013putamen coupling and S\u2013R encoding (error rate index) and O\u2013R encoding (O\u2013R compatibility index) suggests an early formation of habit-like S\u2013R and O\u2013R memory traces under instructed learning conditions. These observations are in line with recent re-assessments of certain aspects of the traditional habit concept (e.g., Seger & Spiering,  ). First, it is well known that behavioral control shifts from goal-directed to habitual with extended practice. Contrary to this notion, in the present study the extent of practice was minimal (eight S\u2013R\u2013O repetitions). It is therefore likely that putamen involvement in the present context reflected not the behavioral control by habit-like representations, which would become increasingly dominant only with extended practice, but rather the initial formation of habit-like representations. Hence, learning-related LPFC\u2013putamen coupling seems to reflect the initial formation of S\u2013R and O\u2013R representations as precursors of \u201ctrue\u201d habits, that would develop if practice would proceed substantially longer up to a point at which the putamen might act independently of the lateral PFC. This is in line with the classical distinction between latent learning and performance (Tolman,  ) and with results showing that deactivations of certain cortical regions in the rodent brain can shift behavioral control back-and-forth between habitual and goal-directed independent of the amount of practice (Killcross & Coutureau,  ). Generally, increasing evidence seems to support a concurrent engagement of both habit-related and goal-related computations early in practice (Brovelli, Nazarian, Meunier, & Boussaoud,  ; Dolan & Dayan,  ; Seger & Spiering,  ). \n\nSecond, a habit is typically thought to be operating automatically and in the absence of voluntary control based on explicit knowledge buffered in the PFC. Contrary to this notion, in the present study the neural instantiation of precursors of both \u201cS\u2013R habits\u201d and \u201cO\u2013R habits\u201d emerged specifically via LPFC\u2013putamen interaction suggesting an involvement of explicit contingency knowledge stored in the LPFC. Based on this we suggest the possibility that habits might be established via two different mechanisms. The classical mechanism would operate in the absence of awareness, completely model-free and solely relying on the putamen. Alternatively, habit (S\u2013R as well as O\u2013R) formation in the putamen might occur in the presence of awareness, scaffolded by an explicit model held in the LPFC. From a broader perspective, this characterization of LPFC function in rule-guided behavior is, for instance, in line with data showing that the LPFC is becoming engaged once a subject becomes aware of \u201chidden\u201d (i.e., relatively complex) event contingencies (Rose, Haider, & B\u00fcchel,  ). \n\n\n### Functional couplings between LPFC and hippocampus \n  \nAlthough previous studies have already demonstrated that instruction-based influences on learning are associated with fronto-hippocampal interactions (Li et al.,  ; Ruge & Wolfensteller,  ), the present dissociation between hippocampal subregions appears more difficult to account for conceptually than the dissociation between caudate and putamen discussed above. However, the hippocampus has recently been suggested to play an important role in predicting future states and this hippocampal capacity has in fact been linked to the goal-directed control of action (Fouquet et al.,  ; Johnson, van der Meer, & Redish,  ; Kennedy & Shapiro,  ; Zilli & Hasselmo,  ). Indeed it seems that\u2014consistent with our results\u2014a number of such studies have specifically implicated the posterior/dorsal hippocampus in goal-directed action control (Fouquet et al.,  ; Gourley, Lee, Howell, Pittenger, & Taylor,  ). \n\nMore generally, the hippocampus is known to play a pivotal role in experience-based single-trial episodic memory formation and retrieval (e.g., O\u2019Reilly & Rudy,  ; Rolls,  ; Tulving & Markowitsch,  ). Importantly, there is also ample evidence for an interaction between working memory and episodic memory processes that seems to be based on an interaction between LPFC and hippocampal/parahippocampal areas (Bergmann, Rijpkema, Fern\u00e1ndez, & Kessels,  ; Meyer-Lindenberg et al.,  ; Ranganath, Cohen, & Brozinsky,  ; Zilli & Hasselmo,  ). For instance, anterior hippocampus activation at the time point of encoding has been shown to differentiate particularly well between subsequent correct and erroneous recall of an experienced episode (Summerfield et al.,  ). Notably, the same study also showed that the functional coupling between LPFC and anterior hippocampus predicted subsequent memory performance. Such a finding is in line with the present study results, which suggest a similar relevance of LPFC coupling with the anterior hippocampus during encoding for the subsequent retrieval of O\u2013R associations as expressed in the size of the O\u2013R compatibility effect. This coupling might indicate either the transfer of O\u2013R working memory representation into episodic long-term memory (e.g., Ranganath et al.,  ) or it might reflect the integration of episodic O\u2013R memories into the current task model stored in LPFC working memory. \n\nInterestingly, two other studies reported activations in the anterior hippocampus without LPFC coupling when extensively learnt response outcomes served as primes that should automatically trigger response tendencies consistent with previously established O\u2013R associations (Elsner et al.,  ; Melcher et al.,  ). This suggests that the anterior hippocampus might become independent of LPFC after extensive learning of O\u2013R associations and is not exclusively relevant for short-term O\u2013R encoding/retrieval processes accomplished in cooperation with LPFC as is the case under instruction-based learning conditions in the present study. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nTogether, our results suggest that fronto-striatal couplings enable the learning of novel goal-directed actions via an internal model of response\u2013outcome contingencies buffered in LPFC \u201cprocedural working memory\u201d (cf. Oberauer,  ). More specifically, the learning-related functional coupling between LPFC and anterior caudate is associated with O\u2013R usage rather than with O\u2013R encoding by itself. This suggests a pivotal role of the anterior caudate for establishing the online control of goal-directed action and implies a similar striatal specialization as in model-free feedback-driven learning, yet emerging through functional couplings with the LPFC. As another novel contribution, our study shows that hippocampal involvement in goal-directed action also emerges through functional couplings with the LPFC, and that this hippocampal involvement can be differentiated according to O\u2013R usage (posterior/dorsal) and O\u2013R encoding (anterior/ventral). It remains to be clarified whether the reported correlational effects between behavior and functional couplings are specific for instruction-based learning situations or would generalize to situations in which novel rules are entirely and solely extracted via trial and error. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nRegion of interest\tSubregion\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tCoupling at late \u2013 early\tCoupling at late \u2013 early\tCoupling at late \u2013 early\tCoupling at late \u2013 early\nRegion of interest\tSubregion\tx\ty\tz\tt\tp Voxel (FWE-Corr.)\tCluster Size\tp Cluster (FWE-Corr.)\nLeft basal ganglia\tAnt. caudate\t\u201312\t20\t\u20138\t4.47\t0.028\t8\t.059\nLeft orbitofrontal\tLateral OFC (BA47)\t\u201342\t47\t\u20138\t4.45\t0.06\t32\t.032\nLeft orbitofrontal\tLateral OFC (BA47)\t\u201336\t41\t\u20138\t4.1\t0.112\tSame cluster as above\tSame cluster as above\nRight orbitofrontal\tMedial/central OFC (BA11)\t18\t56\t\u20135\t4.69\t0.042\t3\t.180\n### Caption\nFunctional coupling with LPFC during S\u2013R\u2013O learning (late > early)\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: Tab2\n### Label: Table 2\nRegion of interest\tSubregion\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tCoupling at late \u2013 early\tCoupling at late \u2013 early\tCoupling at late \u2013 early\tCoupling at late \u2013 early\tCoupling at late \u2013 early\tCoupling at late \u2013 early\tCoupling at early\tCoupling at early\tCoupling at late\tCoupling at late\nRegion of interest\tSubregion\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tCovariate O\u2013R usage\tCovariate O\u2013R usage\tCovariate O\u2013R usage\tCovariate O\u2013R usage\tCovariate O\u2013R strength\tComparison between covariates\tCovariate O\u2013R usage\tCovariate O\u2013R strength\tCovariate O\u2013R usage\tCovariate O\u2013R strength\nRegion of interest\tSubregion\tx\ty\tz\tt\tp Cluster (FWE-Corr.)\tCluster Size\tp Voxel (FWE-Corr.)\tt (p Uncorr.)\tt (p Uncorr.)\tt (p Uncorr.)\tt (p Uncorr.)\tt (p Uncorr.)\tt (p Uncorr.)\nLeft basal ganglia\tAnt. caudate\t\u201315\t23\t4\t4.9\t0.01\t27\t0.02\t\u20131.17 (n.s.)\t4.94***\t\u20130.55 (n.s.)\t\u20130.36 (n.s.)\t3.63***\t\u20131.59 (n.s.)\nRight basal ganglia\tAnt. caudate\t12\t23\t4\t5.06\t0.01\t17\t0.04\t0.21 (n.s.)\t3.94***\t\u20130.75 (n.s.)\t\u20130.45 (n.s.)\t3.05**\t\u20130.39 (n.s.)\nLeft hippocampus\tPost. hippocampus\t\u201333\t\u201334\t\u20138\t3.92\t0.04\t3\t0.05\t\u20131.02 (n.s.)\t4.05***\t\u20131.24 (n.s.)\t\u20130.38 (n.s.)\t3.27***\t\u20131.51 (n.s.)\nRight hippocampus\tPost. hippocampus\t33\t\u201334\t\u20138\t3.09\t0.17\t4\t0.19\t\u20130.92 (n.s.)\t3.29***\t\u20131.02 (n.s.)\t0.22 (n.s.)\t2.92**\t\u20130.95 (n.s.)\n### Caption\nCorrelation between O\u2013R usage during S\u2013R\u2013O learning and functional coupling with LPFC during S\u2013R\u2013O learning (late > early)\n### Footer\n*p < .05;

It is important to note that these studies used computer mouses, trackballs, or joysticks to simulate driving and, thus, were not comparable to real driving situations. In order to overcome these limitations, we used a driving wheel and pedal equipped with an MR-compatible driving simulator (80\u00a0km/h). The subjects drove while performing sub-tasks, and we attempted to observe differences in neuronal activation. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe experiments consisted of three blocks and each block consisted of both a control phase (1\u00a0min) and a driving phase (2\u00a0min). During the control phase, the drivers were instructed to look at the stop screen and to not perform driving tasks. During the driving phase, the drivers either drove (driving only condition) or drove while performing an additional sub-task (driving with sub-task condition) at 80\u00a0km/h. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCompared to when the drivers were focused only on driving, when the drivers drove while performing a sub-task, the number of activation voxels greatly decreased in the parietal area, which is responsible for spatial perception. Task-performing areas, such as the inferior frontal gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus, showed increased activation. Performing a sub-task simultaneously while driving had affected the driver\u2019s driving. The cingulate gyrus and the sub-lobar region (lentiform nucleus, caudate, insula, and thalamus), which are responsible for error monitoring and control of unnecessary movements (e.g., wheel and pedal movements), showed increased activation during driving with sub-task condition compared to driving only condition. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nUnlike simple driving simulators (joysticks, computer mouses, or trackballs) used in previous research, the addition of a driving wheel and pedals (accelerator and brake) to the driving simulator used in this study closely represents real driving. Thus, the number of processed movements was increased, which led to an increased number of unnecessary movements that needed to be controlled. This in turn increased activation in the corresponding brain regions. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nDriving is a complex multitasking activity that involves perception, attention, decision-making, sensory, motor, and higher-level cognitive components [ ,  ]. Recent studies on complex multitasking (driving)-related neural correlates have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study its neurophysiological aspects [ \u2013 ]. In previous studies, driving was simulated by using a joystick, computer mouse, or a trackball. They revealed the activation of the following regions: the parietal lobe and precuneus region (spatial perception), the precentral gyrus and frontal eye field regions (motor response, arm and eye movement) [ ,  ], the supplementary motor area (SMA) and cerebellum region (motor control and action planning) [ ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ], and the cingulate gyrus region (attention and error monitoring) [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nRecently, the increase in electronic device use has resulted in the performance of frequent sub-tasks during driving. Sub-tasks can be defined as radio tuning, dialing a cell phone, eating, or carrying on a conversation. These sub-tasks are reported to decrease driving performance (brake response time, tracking performance, speed control, car following, and lane keeping) measured using physiological assessments [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Safe driving requires the ability to concentrate, to divide one\u2019s attention between multiple sensory events across visual and auditory modalities, and to make fast cognitive decisions in a complex and rapidly changing environment. Neuroimaging studies of neurophysiological variables have also elucidated the neural substrates involved during driving while performing sub-tasks such as conversation, auditory language comprehension, and visual event detection [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nSeveral studies have been carried out to observe the changes in brain activation related to visual cognition [ \u2013 ], spatial attention or vigilance [ ,  ], and motor function [ ] while driving and performing sub-tasks simultaneously. It is reported that when performing driving and sub-tasks simultaneously, the activation of the parietal and occipital areas related to driving is reduced [ ,  ,  ,  ]. It is also reported that when performing driving and sub-tasks simultaneously, the activation of the precentral gyrus, the frontal and parietal lobes, and cingulate gyrus areas related to attention, stimulus processing, motor responses, and decision-making is increased [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. When performing driving and sub-tasks simultaneously, motor areas have decreased activation while the activation of areas related to sub-tasks, such as motor control and attention areas, is increased [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nHowever, the above studies were not realistic because the subjects performed the driving task using a joystick, computer mouses, or trackball with one hand in the simulated driving conditions (e.g., video game and driving simulator). In fact, driving is performed using a wheel (handle) and pedals. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the regions of the brain that are activated during the various cognitive activities required in actual driving using the systems used in previous studies. For this reason, some previous studies have attempted to simulate driving in a real driving environment by using a wheel and pedals. When using a computer mouse or a trackball to simulate driving and the sub-tasks simultaneously, fine control is actually worse than when a wheel and pedal is used in actual driving. For example, one can more accurately maintain a lane when controlling a wheel with both hands than when using a computer mouse or a trackball. In addition, one can more accurately control speed using the brake and one can more accurately control acceleration using the right foot than when using a computer mouse and a trackball. We, therefore, performed simulated driving in our study using a wheel and pedals to more accurately simulate driving control and the brain activation patterns present in an actual driving environment. \n\nIn order to overcome the limitations of previous studies, we used an MR-compatible driving simulator with a driving wheel and pedals in order to observe the effects of sub-tasks on driving. Our objective was to observe differences in activated brain regions using neurophysiological assessments during driving alone and when sub-tasks were performed during driving. Our working hypotheses were as follows. First, it is expected that the activation of the parietal area, which is the spatial perception-related area, will decrease and that the activation of areas related to sub-task performance will increase when performing driving and the sub-task simultaneously compared to driving only. Second, when performing driving and the sub-tasks simultaneously, the sub-tasks will affect driving. Therefore, the activation of areas related to behavior and motions used to control driving are expected to increase. Third, as previous studies simulated driving by using one hand (computer mouse, trackball, etc.), while this study used a wheel controlled with both hands and pedals controlled with the right foot, an additional area related to these actions is expected to be activated. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nUsing the MR-compatible driving simulator for cases in which the driver only drives at 80\u00a0km/h (driving only), those in which the driver only performs the sub-task (task only), and those in which the driver performs the sub-task while driving at 80\u00a0km/h (driving with task), the research team designed a method to observe the brain using fMRI. In order to do this, we used subtraction and double subtraction methods. \n\n### Subjects \n  \nFifteen men with a driving experience of 2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\u00a0years and without any psychiatric illness or nerve/brain-related conditions were selected. Their average age was 26.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u00a0years. All subjects were right-handed as evaluated using the revised Edinburgh test [ ]. Any subjects who might have had claustrophobia, pacemakers, or metal embedded in their bodies, which would have affected MR imaging, were excluded from the selection process. Prior to the experiment, all participants were prohibited from smoking, drinking alcohol/coffee, or any external activity that could impair their driving. The experiment was then explained to them. The subjects were required to practice in the simulation environment with the simulator until they could drive normally without crashing. The protocol for the research project was approved by the Institutional Review Committee of Konkuk University, where the work was undertaken. Our research protocol also conforms to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki (KU-IRB-11-46-A-1). \n\n\n### MR-compatible driving simulator \n  \nThe research team developed an MR-compatible driving simulator with a driving wheel and pedals, as seen in Fig.\u00a0 . The simple driving environment was produced using software provided by Lightrock Entertainment, and was made up of mostly straight roadways with very few elements that could distract the driver (Fig.\u00a0 ). The subjects used both hands to operate the wheel and their right foot to control the accelerator and the brake. They drove at a constant 80\u00a0km/h without changing road lanes. Generally, in Korea, the speed limits on the roads are in accordance with Article 19 of \u201cRoad Traffic Act enforcement regulations\u201d (speed of cars, etc.) and the highest speed limit on general roads with two or more one-way lanes (all roads other than highways and motorways) is less than 80\u00a0km/h. In consideration of safety and accessibility when preparing the test video, this study used general roads of two or more one-way lanes as the video, which was presented at a simulated speed of 80\u00a0km/h, which is the regulated speed limit on general roads. The visual information for driving was displayed on a visual system attached to the subjects\u2019 head coil. Fig.\u00a0  shows the preparation before the beginning of the experiment.   \n a   MR-compatible driving simulator consisting of driving wheel, accelerator, and brake.   b   Driving environment (Lightrock Entertainment Inc., S/W).   c   Preparation before the experiment \n  \n\n\n### Experimental design \n  \nThe experiment was performed using three conditions. Each condition consisted of three same blocks and every block has a control phase (1\u00a0min) and a condition phase (2\u00a0min). The first condition is when only driving is performed. In this condition, one block consists of a control phase (1\u00a0min) and a driving only condition (2\u00a0min) (Fig.\u00a0 ). The second condition is when driving and a sub-task are performed simultaneously. In this condition, one block consists of a control phase (1\u00a0min) and a driving with sub-task condition (2\u00a0min) (Fig.\u00a0 ). The third condition is when only a sub-task is performed. In this condition, one block consists of a control phase (1\u00a0min) and a sub-task only condition (2\u00a0min) (Fig.\u00a0 ). Commonly, during the control phase, the drivers were instructed to simply look at the screen, which showed a parked, non-moving state. During the driving only condition, the subjects were asked to only drive at 80\u00a0km/h. During the driving with sub-task condition, the drivers were asked to drive at 80\u00a0km/h while performing a sub-task. Finally, all subjects were asked to only perform a sub-task under identical conditions during the sub-task only condition. Each subject participated in the above three conditions (driving only, driving with sub-task, and sub-task only conditions). Once the first experiment was concluded, the subjects were all provided with plenty of resting time (approximately 30\u00a0min) and were then sent to the next experiment. The condition order was counterbalanced across participants. The speed of the vehicle was displayed on the lower left-hand corner of each subject\u2019s screen in order to help them maintain a speed of 80\u00a0km/h.   \nThe functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experimental procedure \n  \n\nThe sub-task consisted of performing an addition. The addition task consisted of problems using double-digit numbers with sums of less than 100 and required carry-over calculations. Each block consisted of 10 problems. Thus, there were a total of 30 problems in the addition task. The experimenters used the audio system attached to the MR system to vocally present the task and the subjects confirmed the answers using their voices. The subjects were encouraged to concentrate on both driving and the addition tasks. \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nImages were scanned using a 3T MRI system (Magnetom TrioTim, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard 32-channel head coil. Single-shot echo planar fMRI scans were acquired in 29 continuous slices parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line. The parameters for fMRI were as follows: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20093000/30\u00a0ms, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009200\u00a0mm, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, matrix\u2009=\u2009128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128, slice thickness\u2009=\u20095\u00a0mm, and voxel size\u2009=\u20091.6\u2009\u00d7\u20091.6\u2009\u00d7\u20095.0\u00a0mm. Anatomical images were obtained using a T1-weighted three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence with TR/TE\u2009=\u20091900/2.48\u00a0ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009200\u00a0mm, flip angle\u2009=\u20099\u00b0, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u00a0mm, and voxel size\u2009=\u20090.8\u2009\u00d7\u20090.8\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u00a0mm. \n\n\n### Image analysis \n  \nThe fMRI data were analyzed using SPM 8 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). All functional images were aligned with the anatomic images of the study using affine transformation routines built into the SPM 8 program. The realigned scans were co-registered to the participant\u2019s anatomic images obtained within each session. The anatomical images were then segmented into white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. The mean echo planar image (EPI) of each subject was directly warped into the standard EPI template (Montreal Neurologic Institute) during a normalization step. The size of one divided voxel in normalizing process is 1.6\u2009\u00d7\u20091.6\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u00a0mm. The time-series data were motion-corrected by Sinc interpolation and filtered using a 240-s high-pass filter to remove artifacts because of cardiorespiratory and other cyclical influences. The functional images were then smoothed using a 8-mm full-width-half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel prior to statistical analyses. The statistical analysis was conducted using SPM 8 both individually (first level) and as a group (second level) using the general linear model and the theory of Gaussian random fields. Statistical parametric maps were computed using   t  -statistics. Individual subjects were analyzed at a significance threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, which was corrected using the topological peak-false discovery rate (FDR). \n\nThe active regions of the brain during driving only condition and driving with sub-task condition were extracted and compared to those of the control phase using the subtraction method ([driving only or driving with sub-task condition]\u2014control). The double subtraction method was used to observe any regions exhibiting special activity during either driving condition (driving only\u2014driving with sub-task and driving with sub-task\u2014driving only conditions). \n\nWe also extracted the numbers of activation area voxels during driving only condition and driving with sub-task condition using the subtraction method for each subject. We then performed a paired   t  -test (PASW Statistics 18) to compare the numbers of activation area voxels by condition. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Accuracy rate \n  \nWhen only the addition task was performed (sub-task only condition), the accuracy rate of the subjects was 84.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.9%. The accuracy rate was 78.5\u2009\u00b1\u200911.7% when the addition task was combined with driving (driving with sub-task condition) (Table\u00a0 ). No differences of note were observed using a paired   t  -test (PASW Statistics 18) (  p  \u2009=\u20090.196).   \nMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D. of the accuracy rate [%] results by every subject \n  \n\n\n### Brain activation regions determined using the subtraction method \n  \nDuring driving only condition, the frontal region (inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and precentral gyrus), parietal region (superior parietal lobe (SPL), inferior parietal lobe (IPL), postcentral gyrus, and precuneus), temporal region (superior temporal gyrus (STG) and middle temporal gyrus (MTG)), occipital region (inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), superior occipital gyrus (SOG), middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and lingual gyrus), limbic region (cingulate gyrus), sub-lobar region (insula and lentiform nucleus), and the cerebellum (uvular, declive, and cerebellar tonsil) all exhibit activation (Table\u00a0  and Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nThe MNI coordinates,   t  -scores, and number of voxels in the activated areas by the subtraction \n  \nMethod (driving only condition\u2014control) (corrected   p\u2009<  \u20090.05) \n\n R   right cerebrum,   L   left cerebrum,   RC   right cerebellum,   LC   left cerebellum \n    \nBrain activation areas for   a   driving only condition\u2014control,   b   driving with sub-task condition\u2014control, and   c   sub-task only condition\u2014control (corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05\u00a0s) \n  \n\nDuring driving with sub-task condition, the frontal region (IFG, MFG, SFG, precentral gyrus, and sub-gyral), parietal region (postcentral gyrus), temporal region (STG and fusiform gyrus), occipital region (IOG and lingual gyrus), limbic region (cingulate gyrus), sub-lobar region (lentiform nucleus, insula, claustrum, thalamus, cuneus, and caudate), and the cerebellum (cerebellar tonsil and inferior semi-lunar lobule) were shown to have activation (Table\u00a0  and Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nThe MNI coordinates,   t  -scores, and number of voxels in the activated areas by the subtraction method (driving with sub-task condition\u2014control) (corrected   p\u2009<  \u20090.05) \n  \n R   right cerebrum,   L   left cerebrum,   RC   right cerebellum,   LC   left cerebellum \n  \n\nIn order to compare the numbers of activation area voxels for each condition calculated using the above subtraction method, we performed a paired   t  -test by extracting the areas activated in common. \n\nThe number of activation voxels was significantly reduced in areas such as the MFG (  p  \u2009=\u20090.046) and the precentral gyrus (  p  \u2009=\u20090.033) during driving with sub-task condition when compared to the driving only condition. On the other hand, when driving and performing the sub-tasks simultaneously, the number of activation voxels was significantly increased in the postcentral gyrus (  p  \u2009=\u20090.031) and the insula (  p  \u2009=\u20090.011) when compared to driving only condition. Other commonly activated areas were IFG, SFG, STG, IOG, cingulate gyrus, lentiform nucleus, and the cerebellar tonsil. There were no significant differences between the two conditions in these areas. \n\nDuring sub-task only condition, the frontal region (IFG, MFG, SFG, and precentral gyrus), parietal region (IPL), temporal region (inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), MTG, STG, and caudate), limbic region (cingulate gyrus), sub-lobar region (lentiform nucleus and insula), and the cerebellum (uvula, culmen, and declive) showed signs of activation (Table\u00a0  and Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nThe MNI coordinates,   t  -scores, and number of voxels in the activated areas by the subtraction method (sub-task only condition\u2014control) (corrected   p\u2009<  \u20090.05) \n  \n R   right cerebrum,   L   left cerebrum,   RC   right cerebellum,   LC   left cerebellum \n  \n\n\n### Brain activation regions determined using the double subtraction method \n  \nThe double subtraction method was used to observe the regions of the brain that exhibited special activation when the subject was only driving (driving only condition) or driving while performing a sub-task (driving with sub-task condition). \n\nThe brain regions activated during driving only condition were subtracted from the regions that were activated during driving with sub-task condition. These results are presented in Table\u00a0  and Fig.\u00a0 . The results show that brain activation is increased in the frontal region (MFG, medial frontal gyrus (MeFG), and precentral gyrus), parietal region (SPL, IPL, postcentral gyrus, and precuneus), temporal region (MTG and STG), occipital region (IOG, SOG, MOG, lingual gyrus, and cuneus), limbic region (cingulate gyrus), and the cerebellum (uvula, declive, inferior semi-lunar lobule, and cerebellar tonsil). In particular, we observed a large increase in the superior parietal lobule. Large increases were also seen in the middle frontal gyrus, the middle occipital gyrus, and the uvula of the cerebellum. These regions correspond to those that have reduced or no activation when driving is performed along with secondary activities.   \nThe MNI coordinates,   t  -scores, and number of voxels in the activated areas by the double subtraction method (driving only condition\u2014driving with sub-task condition) (corrected   p\u2009<  \u20090.05) \n  \n R   right cerebrum,   L   left cerebrum,   RC   right cerebellum,   LC   left cerebellum \n    \nBrain activation areas for   a   driving only condition\u2014driving with sub-task condition and   b   driving with sub-task condition\u2014driving only condition (corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05) \n  \n\nTo determine the activated brain regions during driving with sub-task condition, the regional activation during driving with sub-task condition is subtracted from the activation during driving only condition. These results are summarized in Table\u00a0  and Fig.\u00a0 . The results indicate an increased activation in the frontal region (IFG, SFG, and precentral gyrus), temporal region (STG), limbic region (cingulate gyrus), sub-lobar region (lentiform nucleus, caudate, insula, and thalamus), and the cerebellum (culmen and declive). In particular, there are large activation increases in the superior temporal gyrus, the cingulate gyrus, the sub-lobar area, which includes the lentiform nucleus, caudate, insula, and thalamus.   \nThe MNI coordinates,   t  -scores, and number of voxels in the activated areas by the double subtraction method (driving with sub-task condition\u2014driving only condition) (corrected   p\u2009<  \u20090.05) \n  \n R   right cerebrum,   L   left cerebrum,   RC   right cerebellum,   LC   left cerebellum \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere we analyzed the effects of conducting a sub-task (addition task) during driving on brain activation using fMRI. \n\nNotable differences were not observed in the accuracy rates sub-task only condition vs. driving with sub-task condition. It was expected that all of the experiment participants would show a higher task performance ability in the sub-task only condition rather than the driving with sub-task condition. Of the total of 15 participants, however, three showed opposite results. Before the experiment, all of the participants were requested to concentrate on the experiment (driving, task performance, etc.). But the three participants are deemed to have low concentration during their task performance in the sub-task only condition to show such a low accuracy. Additional study will be necessary in this regard. \n\nBrain activation during driving situations has consistently been the subject of ongoing research [ \u2013 ]. Just et al. [ ] used a computer mouse and trackball to simulate driving and reported that the parietal cortex, occipital cortex, motor cortex, and the cerebellum exhibit activation during this task. Uchiyama et al. [ ] used a joystick to control the vehicles and observed the IFG, MFG, SFG, IPL, SPL, MTG, basal ganglia, primary sensorimotor cortex (S1), and SMA. Hsieh et al. [ ] noted that while a driving scene is simply being observed, the MFG, IFG, STG, orbitofrontal cortex, occipital lobe, fusiform gyrus, cingulate gyrus, SMA, and the basal ganglia show activation. The results that we obtained during driving only condition show similar areas of activation (motor cortex, IPL, SPL, fusiform gyrus, and cerebellum; Table\u00a0 ) to those observed in previous research. Previous studies [ ,  ,  ] simulated driving using a computer mouse or trackballs. In these studies, one hand was used in the simulator environment. However, in this study, the subjects controlled a driving wheel using both hands in a real driving environment and controlled pedals using the ankle of the right lower limb. Because of the movement of both the hands and the right foot, the left precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex, M1) appeared to have the voxels with the highest activation. We also observed activation of the motor control-related right premotor cortex, which is used in adjusting precise movements [ ,  ]. Since tactile sensory feedback is also generated through the wheel and the pedals, the right postcentral gyrus (S1) was activated [ ,  ]. The activation of the somatosensory association cortex in the left IPL (BA 40) at the supramarginal gyrus [ ] was especially great. In addition, we observed activations of the right precuneus area, which is related to visuomotor coordination [ ,  ], and the right fusiform gyrus (BA 37), which is related to high-level visual cognition [ ]. We also observed a larger number of activation voxels in the uvula of cerebellum, which is an area related to motor control and action planning [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nWhen driving and a secondary task (auditory language comprehension task) were performed simultaneously, similar areas (motor cortex and the parietal and occipital lobes) were activated. This is similar to what is observed when only driving is performed. However, the numbers of activation voxels and activity intensity was decreased in these areas while the temporal and inferior frontal regions related to the sub-task had increases in activation [ ]. Uchiyama et al. [ ] observed the activation of similar areas (motor cortex and parietal and occipital lobes) when driving was performed along with an auditory task. However, they also reported activation of the STG and the primary auditory cortex. We observed that similar regions (motor cortex, SPG, IPG, and MOG) were activated to those activated when the subjects only drove (Table\u00a0 ). However, the numbers of activation voxels of these regions were decreased and the IFG and STG, which are related to the addition task showed activation. The IFG was noted as an area significantly associated with the performance of additional tasks in previous research [ ,  ]. Here, the same areas were activated during driving with sub-task condition and sub-task only condition (Tables\u00a0  and  ). The additional activation of the STG is thought to occur because the experiment used in the study required the subjects to listen to and then respond to the additional task (Tables\u00a0  and  ). Unlike in previous studies [ ,  ], we observed that the number of activation voxels in the postcentral gyrus (S1) and the insular cortex appeared high in driving with sub-task condition. Unlike previous studies, where a joystick, computer mouse, or trackball was used with one hand, our study required the subjects to adjust a driving wheel with both hands and pedals with the right foot. The grip force of both hands required to hold the driving wheel to concentrate (lane keeping) on driving increased when driving with sub-task condition compared to driving only condition. In addition, the right foot touched the pedal more frequently to keep the speed at 80\u00a0km/h. Thus, the left postcentral gyrus area, which is the somatosensory area [ ,  ], is expected to be activated significantly. In addition, when driving is performed simultaneously with a sub-task, hand movements were used to finely control the wheel in order to maintain the lane. These movements and those of the right ankle use for controlling the pedal to keep the speed at 80\u00a0km/h were more frequent. Thus, activation of the insula, which is related to perception, motor control, self-awareness, and cognitive function [ ], was shown to be significantly increased in both hemispheres. \n\nJust et al. [ ] used the double subtraction method to analyze differences in brain activation while driving and driving while performing a secondary task (an auditory language comprehension task). When drivers were focused only on driving, compared to when they drove while performing an auditory distraction task of language comprehension, the supramarginal gyrus, SPL, IPL, and SOG showed increased activation. In particular, activation voxels of the SPL had the largest increase. Based on our results, when drivers were focused only on driving compared to when they drove while performing a task, the SPL and IPL areas, which are related to spatial perception [ ], showed increased activation, similar to observations in previous studies. The visuomotor coordination-related left SPL [ ,  ] showed the largest increase. \n\nWhen drivers were focused only on driving compared to when they drove while performing a task, activation is thought to have increased in the above areas because the subjects were focused only on driving while controlling the wheel with both hands and controlling the pedals with their right foot. The parietal area is in charge of not only spatial processing but also visual spatial attention [ ]. Thus, it has been determined that secondary activities negatively affect functions related to driving. Unlike previous studies [ ], our study indicates that when drivers are focused driving only condition compared to driving with sub-task condition, the right MFG, which is the premotor cortex area related to spatial attention, movement planning, and execution [ ,  ], the visual-related right and left MOG [ ], and the action planning and motor control-related uvula of the cerebellum [ ,  ,  ] show remarkably increased activation (Table\u00a0 ). The negative effects on these areas are thought to occur because performing sub-tasks interferes with information processing during driving. \n\nCompared to cases where only driving was performed, driving while performing additional tasks was shown to decrease brain activation in some regions, whereas other regions related to activity completion were additionally activated [ ,  ,  ]. We observed that driving with sub-task condition was performed compared to driving only condition, the SPL, MFG, MOG, and cerebellar regions related to driving had less activation (Table\u00a0 ). In contrast, there was increased activation in the IFG and the STG, which affect secondary task completion (Tables\u00a0 ,  , and  ). The cingulate gyrus region and the sub-lobar region (lentiform nucleus, caudate, insula, and thalamus) in particular showed evidence of increased activation (Table\u00a0 ). These results can be attributed to the fact that when driving is paired with a secondary task, driving performance is affected. Moreover, the increase in desire to control increases the activation of the cingulate gyrus and sub-lobar regions, as they control error monitoring and unnecessary movement control, respectively [ ,  ,  ,  ]. In addition, during driving with sub-task condition, we observed activation of the right temporal gyrus (BA 38) region, which is related to highly processed perceptual inputs to visceral responses, for complex cognitive processing [ ,  ]. \n\n### Limitation \n  \nAlthough not performed in this study, it is necessary to analyze the relationship between actual driving performance and brain activity by additionally extracting the activation patterns for a variety of driving performance conditions (maintaining driving speed, responding to uncertainties during driving, lane keeping, etc.) when driving and the sub-task are performed simultaneously. We would then carry out a study on how the sub-task affects actual driving performance. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, when driving and a sub-task were performed together (driving with sub-task condition\u2014driving only condition), the regions associated with driving show less activation, as observed in previous studies. In particular, the spatial perception regions have the largest decreases among all the regions assessed. Unlike in previous research [ ,  ,  ], our double subtraction results (driving with sub-task condition\u2014driving only condition) indicate a clear increase in activation in the cingulate gyrus and the sub-lobar region. Unlike the simple driving simulators used in previous research, which used joysticks, computer mouses, or trackballs for simulation, the addition of a driving wheel and pedals (accelerator and brake) to the driving simulator used in this study closely represents real driving. Thus, the number of processed movements increases, leading to an increased number of unnecessary movements that need to be controlled. This in turn increases the activation of the corresponding brain regions. \n\nThere are numerous research studies investigating brain activation changes using simple driving simulators equipped with joysticks, computer mouses, or trackballs. However, research studies similar to ours, which employs a simulator that closely reflects reality, have been sparse in comparison. Further research on the effects of sub-tasks on brain activation of drivers of varied driving skills is required. This paper is expected to contribute basic data toward studying the effects of sub-tasks during driving. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nSubject\tDriving with sub-task

A novel functional MRI task paradigm involving wrist movement was developed to gain insight into the effects of multimodal sensory feedback on brain functional networks in stroke participants. This paradigm consisted of an intermittent position search task using the wrist during fMRI signal acquisition with visual and auditory feedback of proximity to a target position. We enrolled 12 young adults, 10 participants with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis, and nine age-matched controls. Activation maps were obtained, and functional connectivity networks were calculated using an independent component analysis (ICA) approach. Task-based networks were identified using activation maps, and nodes were obtained from the ICA components. These nodes were subsequently used for connectivity analyses. Stroke participants demonstrated significantly greater contralesional activation than controls during the visual feedback condition and less ipsilesional activity than controls during the auditory feedback condition. The sensorimotor component obtained from the ICA differed between rest and task for control and stroke participants: task-related lateralization to the contralateral cortex was observed in controls, but not in stroke participants. Connectivity analyses between the lesioned sensorimotor cortex and the contralesional cerebellum demonstrated decreased functional connectivity in stroke participants (  p   < 0.005), which was positively correlated the Box and Blocks arm function test (  r   = 0.59). These results suggest that task-based functional connectivity provides detail on changes in brain networks in stroke survivors. The data also highlight the importance of cerebellar connections for recovery of arm function after stroke. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIn this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a novel task paradigm to investigate the effects of multimodal sensory feedback on detection of brain functional networks after stroke. In prior studies, the primary motor cortical regions and their pathways have been a major focus in investigating the functional effects of stroke lesions on the brain ( \u2013 ). However, brain lesions might have an even stronger impact on integrative networks that process multisensory inputs and plan movements in a functional context. Lesions affecting sensorimotor integrative networks of the brain are likely to play a critical role in recovery, and damage to these networks could lead to chronic impairment, as they are important to motor learning and recovery ( ,  \u2013 ). Although current measures of functional connectivity characterize communication between brain motor regions, the changes in connectivity of the sensorimotor association areas have been largely unexplored in stroke survivors. In order to characterize the function of sensorimotor networks in stroke survivors, we measured brain connectivity and activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during rest and during tasks that invoked key features of sensorimotor and multisensory integration. \n\nfMRI has been used to characterize differences in brain activation patterns in stroke survivors and to document cortical plasticity with natural recovery or following targeted therapeutic interventions. In general, increased intensity and spread of brain activation after stroke have been associated with decreased functional outcomes. During finger movement, stroke survivors have increased cortical activation with a broader spatial extent in the ipsilesional hemisphere as well as contralesional activity that is absent in controls ( ). Increases in cortical activity distant from primary motor areas impacted by a stroke lesion are considered evidence for cortical reorganization ( ). These plastic changes might be compensatory or conversely, they could be maladaptive for functional recovery. During recovery, the intensity, and spread of brain activation associated with hand grip decreases in lower functioning stroke survivors ( ), suggesting that simple task-related brain activation volumes are inversely correlated with functional recovery. In contrast, decreased activity in cortical areas have been documented in stroke survivors using the relatively more complex task of bilateral pedaling during fMRI ( ), possibly due to a greater reliance on integrative sensorimotor regions that might become dysfunctional after stroke. The recent emergence of brain functional connectivity analyses ( ,  ) offers the opportunity to interpret changes in task-related brain activity in the context of brain networks, potentially offering insight into the mechanisms underlying changes in brain function after stroke. \n\nFunctional connectivity analyses also provide evidence of changes in brain function after stroke. Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) ( ,  ) infers coactivation of one or more cortical areas by their correlated fMRI signal over time. This analysis can be used to identify functional networks using fMRI signals obtained at rest ( ) or during a task ( ). For this analysis, nodes can be defined using predetermined anatomical regions of interest or identified by measuring regional homogeneity of voxel-wise intrinsic functional connectivity ( ). Alternatively, functional connectivity can be decomposed into a set of spatiotemporal networks using an independent component analysis ( ,  ); an independent component consists of a 3D volume that provides each voxel's contribution to a network and a BOLD time-course that is shared by all voxels within that network. In resting-state fMRI, one of the most consistent findings in stroke participants is decreased functional connectivity between the ipsilesional and contralesional sensorimotor cortices ( \u2013 ). While resting state functional connectivity and task-based connectivity share correspondence, they also have many notable differences ( \u2013 ). In healthy individuals, the spatial extent of nodes determined by an independent component analysis is similar across task and resting state paradigms ( ). In contrast, task-based connectivity exhibits \u201clocal specialization\u201d with increased connectivity of long-distance connections compared to resting state analyses ( ,  ). This means that areas engaged in a given task have increased local connectivity in the task-specific area (i.e., local specialization) and increased global connectivity (long distance connections) between the different areas engaged with that task. For a multimodal sensorimotor task, we expect increased local specialization within the primary sensorimotor region and increased long-distance communication between the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortices and contralesional cerebellum, similar to activation results reported during complex motor tasks ( ). \n\nFunctional connectivity analyses are particularly effective in quantifying functionally relevant changes in brain networks after stroke and during recovery ( ). It has been suggested that network integrity and reorganization is critical for functional recovery after stroke ( ). Each cortical region can actively participate in multiple functional networks, allowing the brain to reorganize after damage to a particular node. Network plasticity has been documented in the motor network of people with stroke ( ) and the integrity of contralesional parietofrontal and sensorimotor cortical networks has been associated with lower motor impairment after stroke ( ). These findings suggest that resting state and task-based connectivity of sensorimotor integration areas predict motor function, and plasticity of these networks provide mechanisms for restoring motor function. \n\nIn order to identify changes in sensorimotor networks in chronic stroke survivors, we calculated the functional connectivity of the brain using resting state and task-based MRI, with a unique sensorimotor task that employs sensorimotor and multisensory integration. The task was specifically designed to engage integrative sensorimotor networks during controlled wrist movement. We then compared the changes in these networks to a clinical measure of upper limb function. We hypothesized that only during the task, functional connectivity between brain networks associated with sensorimotor integration would be reduced in stroke survivors, and that the reduction would be correlated to arm function. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data Collection \n  \n#### Participant Recruitment and Clinical Testing \n  \nTwelve young adults (four female, 25.2 \u00b1 2.4 years), 10 individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis (four female, age 66.7 \u00b1 7.94 years, at least 1.1 years since stroke), and nine age-matched control participants (five female, age 64.2 \u00b1 7.73 years) participated in this study. The young adults were included as additional data to validate the new task paradigm in its ability to show areas of the brain involved in performing the task. Each participant provided informed written consent to the experimental protocol, which was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Marquette University and the Medical College of Wisconsin. Inclusion criteria included a history of an ischemic cortical or subcortical stroke that occurred no <6 months prior to recruitment. Participants with no ability to perform supination, pronation, ulnar deviation, or radial deviation of the wrist were excluded. Controls without history of stroke or other neurological impairments were age-matched (within 3 years) and gendered-matched to the stroke participants. Each stroke participant completed the upper extremity (UE) portion of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( ) for a maximum possible score of 126. Participants also completed the Box and Blocks Test of Manual Dexterity ( ), the Wolf Motor Function Test ( ) for upper extremity motor ability (maximum score of 75), and the Modified Ashworth Scale ( ). These clinical measurements were correlated with measured brain activity during the task and the functional connectivity during resting state and during the task. The stroke participant clinical scores and lesion locations are shown in  , and   shows the lesion distribution; although there is little lesion overlap, the lesion distribution shows damage in the sensorimotor pathways. \n  \nStroke participant clinical scores and lesion location. \n  \n Participant information including affected and dominant limb, lesion location, and clinical scores including Box and Blocks, Wolf Motor, and Fugl-Meyer upper extremity (CST, corticospinal tract; PLIC, posterior limb of the internal capsule; PrCG, pre-central gyrus; PoCG, post-central gyrus; CP, cerebral peduncle)  . \n  \n\n#### Experimental Paradigm \n  \nOur sensorimotor integration experiment was designed with cues and feedback that contrasted the effects of auditory and visual sensation. We introduced a task paradigm for studying the role of sensory integration in complex movement. Chronic stroke participants have more difficulty coordinating sensorimotor behavior, especially in tasks with higher complexity ( ). Our task required the participant to produce movement while integrating multiple sensory modalities. \n\n##### Motion recording and audiovisual feedback \n  \nEvery participant completed two sessions on separate days no more than 2 weeks apart. Participants were trained to perform a wrist-movement task during the first session. The second session used the same wrist movement task and consisted of a second training period 1 h before the task-based fMRI session. The experimental apparatus is shown in   (left). The forearm of the impaired limb was fixed on a small ramp to allow for radial and ulnar deviation of the wrist. Both the elbow and the forearm were secured on the ramp to ensure that the task was controlled by wrist movement only. The hand gripped the end of a ShapeTape device (Measurand Inc., Canada), an array of 16 optical fiber sensor pairs that provide 3D Euclidean coordinates along the sensor region. Each sensor pair also provided a 3D rotation matrix expressed in quaternion form. Visual feedback was presented on a computer monitor, and speakers provided auditory feedback. Motion data were recorded every 24 ms, or 41.67 Hz. \n  \nTask paradigm for wrist movement and sensorimotor integration.   (Left)   Illustration of the ShapeTape apparatus. The forearm position was fixed.   (Right)   Experimental design of the multisensory search task. During each trial, the participant maximized sensory feedback using wrist joint angles to minimize error to a target angle. The participant was instructed to move the wrist to maximize the circle diameter and/or a sound volume. Auditory, visual, or audiovisual feedback were presented at the start and during each trial. After reaching the target, the participant fixated on a yellow square during a 2\u20134 s intertrial period. The average trial duration was 5 s. \n  \nShown in   (left), two sensor pairs at the end of the ShapeTape were used to calculate a 3D ray with angle   \u03b8=  {\u03b8 , \u03b8 } relative to the horizontal (x-z) plane, which was used to define the orientation of the wrist. Effectively, pronation/supination was mapped to an angle within the x-y plane \u03b8 , and radial and ulnar deviation was mapped to an angle in the z-y plane. Letting   p   and   p   be the 3D coordinates of the last two sensors, an orientation vector    v    was calculated as: \n\nThe wrist orientation was estimated as \u03b8  = (  v  /  v  ), and \u03b8  = (  v  /  v  ). For each search task, a target angle,   \u03c6  , was created. The error to   \u03c6   during the search task was calculated as  .   E   was then used to provide feedback to the participant related to wrist proximity to the target. The feedback intensity,   w  , was calculated as   w   = exp(\u2212  E  /\u03c3), with the sensitivity parameter \u03c3 fixed at 0.1 radians for all trials. Intensity   w   was used to modulate visual and auditory feedback stimuli. Auditory feedback was a 440 Hz tone and its volume was modulated linearly by   w  . Visual feedback was presented as a solid red circle at the center of a black screen. The circle diameter was modulated linearly by   w   from 15 to 160 pixels or 0.38\u20134.06 cm. The screen was placed ~2 feet away from the eyes. The resulting aperture angle was effectively varied 0.179\u20131.91 degrees. \n\n\n##### Experimental design \n  \nAs shown in   (right), a search-based wrist movement task was designed to invoke brain networks involved in sensorimotor and multisensory integration. The first session began with up to five familiarization trials, in which the participant used the wrist to move a white cursor to a yellow square target at the center of the screen. These trials were also used to verify the participant's range of motion. Once comfortable reaching the square, the participant was then informed that the square and cursor would not be visible. At the start of each trial, one of three types of sensory feedback was presented. For both the training session and the fMRI session, a series of two search-task runs (\u201csearch\u201d) (6 min each) and one sensory-motor (\u201cSM\u201d) only run (6 min) were conducted. \n\nThe \u201csearch\u201d task run consisted of a series of trials, each trial including visual, auditory, or combined audiovisual feedback. In the visual-only feedback condition, a solid red circle appeared and grew larger as error decreased. Once the participant reached the target, the solid red circle was changed into an outline and then disappeared. During auditory-only trials, the participant searched for the target with feedback provided by the tone volume. Upon reaching the target, the tone was altered to a fixed pitch of 880 Hz, giving a \u201cbeep\u201d sound, and turned off. In audiovisual feedback trials, the red circle and auditory tone were mapped independently to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate errors. The goal was to maximize both feedback intensities. After the target was reached, the participant fixated at a yellow square at the center of the screen for an inter-trial period with a normal random duration of 2.5 \u00b1 0.5 s. Participants were notified that the trial would end automatically after an unspecified time if they failed to reach the target. A maximum trial duration of 15 s was used for all experiments. \n\nA control task (\u201cSM\u201d) involving isolated sensory and motor tasks was conducted after the two search-based task runs. In the motor task, the words \u201cKeep Moving\u201d appeared on the screen, and the participant was told to move the wrist randomly in a similar pattern as during the search task. The participant was instructed to stop moving once the words disappeared. The message \u201cRelax\u201d was displayed on the screen for 2 s prior to the sensory only trials. For this condition, the participant was warned that there would be times during which the red circle and sound would appear and change outside of the participant's control. The participant was trained to not move and just watch and listen. The last instruction to the participant was \u201cIf you see the words \u201cKeep moving\u201d then move. If you do not see the words \u201cKeep moving,\u201d then stay still no matter what happens.\u201d Throughout this final run, the experiment would alternate between motor-only and sensory-only conditions every 12 \u00b1 2.0 s. \n\n\n\n#### MRI Scans \n  \nEvery participant was screened for MRI safety before entering the magnetic environment. An axial T1-weighted anatomical image was acquired using a fast spoiled gradient recalled (SPGR) pulse sequence, with TE: 3.2 ms, TR: 8.16 ms, flip angle: 12 deg, prep time: 450, bandwidth: 22.73, FOV: 240 mm, 156 1 mm slices, matrix size: 256 \u00d7240. For functional MRI, a sagittal view gradient-echo echo-planar sequence was acquired with TE: 25 ms, TR: 2,000 ms, flip angle: 77 deg, FOV: 240 \u00d7240 mm, 41 slices with 3.5 mm thickness. Four 6 min fMRI scans were performed, one for resting state, two for the search task, and one for the sensory motor only task. \n\n\n#### MRI Experimental Setup \n  \nAs the participant lay supine, the forearm was elevated with foam and fixed in place with sandbags. The ShapeTape was placed into the participant's impaired hand, or right hand in healthy adults. Visual feedback was projected to a visor attached to the head coil, and earbuds were placed into the ears to provide auditory feedback. The MRI scan session consisted of one resting-state run followed by three task-based runs. During the 6 min resting-state run, each participant was asked to close their eyes and stay alert. After the resting-state scan, the ShapeTape was placed into the participant's hand. If the participant had difficulty gripping the device, then a surgical wrap was used to keep the hand closed. The participant completed three 6-min runs of the same experiment conducted for the first session, including two search-based and one sensory-motor only. \n\n\n\n### Image Registration and Lesion Side Normalization \n  \nIntersubject and intermodality image registration was completed in both healthy adults and stroke participants using fully automated techniques. Each participant's anatomical T1-weighted MRI volume was registered to a 152-brain MNI space using a 12-parameter affine registration, and then non-linear image registration was performed using Maxwell's demons algorithm ( ). Local histogram matching was performed prior to deformable image registration in order to mitigate errors caused by lesion contrasts ( ). In brief, each voxel in the subject's T1-weighted image was assigned a value from 0 to 1 based on its percentile for a 5 \u00d75 \u00d75 voxel neighborhood centered at that voxel. The resulting deformed T1-weighted image was histogram-matched to the MNI template, where the local percentile of the subject's T1-weighted image was matched to the same percentile of the MNI template. Finally, 5 iterations of the demons algorithm were performed at the full 1 mm resolution to align the edges of the images. \n\nThe images of all stroke participants that completed the experiment with the left arm were flipped over the sagittal plane so that all lesions were on the left side of MNI space. One of these participants had a lesion within the left cerebellum, which was flipped to the right side. The flipping placed all strokes outside the cerebellum on the left side of MNI space. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Processing \n  \n#### General Linear Model for the Search Task \n  \nTask-based functional MRI analysis was performed with AFNI (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages, RRID:SCR_005927, afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni). Data were temporally resampled in order to correct for non-uniform slice acquisition timing within each volume. BOLD signal changes related to head translation and rotation were corrected by affine coregistration between volumes using AFNI's 3dvolreg function. The data were high-pass filtered above 0.01 Hz. The motion parameters included roll, yaw, pitch, and x, y, z translations, and were treated as coregressors for all subsequent analyses. \n\n\n#### General Linear Model and Cortical Activation Maps \n  \nWe were interested in stroke-related differences in cortical activity involved in sensorimotor integration during movement. In addition, we are interested in the young and age-matched control differences during this task. As previously shown in  , at the start of the trial the sensory feedback was at its lowest value. On the contrary, the level of wrist motion (not displayed in the figure) was greatest at the start of the search. As the participant closed in on the target, sensory feedback increased. In this latter phase of the task, finer wrist movements were required. Thus, wrist movement was greatest at the start of each trial, and sensory feedback was greatest at the end. In order to identify the brain activity associated with movement, wrist motion was estimated as the absolute change in   \u03b8   with time. However, as mentioned above, the wrist motion parameters throughout time were used as co-regressors to help control for the variation in movement during the earlier and later stages of the task. \n\nThe sensory feedback and wrist movement signals, both produced with our in-house software from the ShapeTape data, were median filtered with a window of 2 s. Using the \u201cwaver\u201d function in AFNI, the signals were then convolved with a double-gamma variate hemodynamic response function to produce modeled BOLD responses and resampled to the fMRI temporal resolution of 0.5 Hz. This method was repeated for the auditory, visual, and audiovisual feedback conditions to produce three movement regressors (A , V , AV ) and three sensory feedback regressors (A , V , AV ). Using the 3dDeconvolve program in AFNI, a multilinear regression was performed for each voxel, with the six task-related regressors and six head motion parameters (three rotation, three translation) contributing to the BOLD signal. The marginal   t  -value for the beta coefficient of each task-related regressor was resampled into 1 mm MNI space. These six cortical activation maps were calculated for every stroke participant and age-matched control. \n\n\n#### Within Network Functional Connectivity \n  \nWe were interested in the within network and between network functional connectivity. For the within network functional connectivity, functional connectivity MRI analysis was performed with Multivariate Exploratory Linear Decomposition into Independent Components (MELODIC) Version 3.14 available with the FMRIB's Software Library (FSL, RRID:SCR_002823,  ). All runs and the stroke and aged matched control participants were time concatenated for a single 75-run (19 participants and 4 runs) group ICA. The sensory-motor only task run of stroke participant S04 was not included in the analysis since data collection was not complete. The data were high-pass filtered with a cutoff frequency of 0.01 Hz ( ). The first five TRs were discarded to exclude signal drifts due to system ramp-up. This left each run with 175 volumes over 350 s. The functional image volumes were motion corrected using the MCFLIRT implementation ( ). Slice-time correction was applied using linear interpolation. Skull-stripping was automatically performed with the brain extraction tool (BET) ( ), and the data were spatially smoothed with a 5 mm full-width half-max Gaussian kernel. The skull stripped images were visually inspected to ensure the quality of the skull stripping. The resulting brain mask was used to exclude non-brain voxels from the remaining analysis. All participants were spatially normalized to an anatomical MNI standard template using a 12-parameter affine registration implemented in FLIRT ( ). The voxel BOLD times series were demeaned, variance normalized, and whitened. \n\nThe number of independent components were estimated using a Bayesian approach described by Minka et al. ( ). Once the independent components for the combined stroke and age matched control data were calculated, a dual regression ( ) was used to estimate individual spatial maps and time courses for each participant and session. Components with vertical stripes in the axial view were associated with motion and excluded from further analysis. Voxel-based general linear modeling was performed between stroke and age-matched controls, and between rest and task conditions for each independent component. The resulting maps of t values were used as representations of the contributions of each condition to the component of interest. The term \u201cwithin network functional connectivity\u201d was used to refer to this relationship between the group/task and the network component. \n\n\n#### Task-Based Network Identification \n  \nOverall relationships between resting-state networks and the task conditions were estimated with temporal correlation. The BOLD response to each task condition was modeled by convolving the stimulus presentation time signal with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function. The modeled time courses were concatenated across all 19 participants and four runs using the same arrangement used for the time-concatenated group ICA. The relationship between an independent component and the experimental variable was estimated by correlating the spatial component's data time course to the modeled BOLD response of the experimental variable. Since the movement-only and sensory-only conditions were presented in regular 15 s intervals, their modeled time courses were used to identify the functional brain network associated with the task. Shown in  , one particular task-related independent component (SM ) had a high correlation (  r   > 0.9) with the movement-only condition. This component, shown in   below, will be referred to as the active sensorimotor network. \n\n\n#### Between-Network Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nIn order to assess the between-network functional connectivity, group ICA network maps were thresholded at a z-score of 30, and local maxima of clusters >2 cm  were treated as nodes for a subsequent seed-based functional connectivity analysis. The z-score threshold and cluster size threshold were chosen heuristically such that only one or two clusters remained for each network. The voxel with the maximum z-score was used from each cluster for seed-based analysis. Shown in  , a total of 27 local maxima were extracted from the left and right sensorimotor networks, the left and right parietofrontal control networks, the default-mode network, the bilateral cerebellar network, the bilateral extrastriate visual network, the primary visual network, the left and right auditory networks, and the bilateral thalamic network. Since the task-fMRI data were also included in the ICA, the left sensorimotor network map contained three clusters. These included the left precentral gyrus, and two clusters within the right cerebellum. The inclusion of task-positive BOLD data also caused the right sensorimotor network's local maximum to occur within the postcentral gyrus. Since the contralesional sensorimotor network has been shown to be involved in motor plasticity after stroke, the nodes from left and right sensorimotor networks were reflected over the mid-sagittal plane to produce 4 additional nodes. Independent components related to motion or cardiac artifact were regressed out of the raw BOLD data. The six motion regressors that were calculated by the MCFLIRT function prior to the group ICA were also used to clean the original BOLD data. The temporal correlation coefficient was calculated from the cleaned BOLD time courses of each pair of seed points. \n  \nLocations used for between network seed-based FC analysis. \n  \n Table of point locations used for seed-based functional connectivity analysis.

Group differences in functional connectivity maps were calculated in a 4 mm resolution MNI space as output by MELODIC. In our AFNI pipeline, we upsampled the BOLD activation maps into 1 mm MNI space before group comparison. Three BOLD activation maps from AFNI and four spatial network maps from the FSL dual regression analysis were compared between groups and conditions by using voxel-based Student's   t  -tests. Since we were focused on sensorimotor function in this study, only the spatial maps of networks included in   were analyzed. Voxel-level Student's   t  -tests were performed to test contrasts between stroke and control groups. In the functional network maps, additional paired   t  -tests were performed to determine within-group contrasts between resting-state and search. Spatial clusters of significantly different voxels (  p   < 0.01) were identified. In order to account for multiple comparisons, a corrected alpha value of 0.05 was used to remove clusters less than a threshold size determined by 3dClustSim tool in AFNI. 3dClustSim, which corrects for multiple comparisons using FDR correction, was applied to both 4 mm and 1 mm MNI space templates to estimate cluster size thresholds for FDR correction. The cluster size threshold was 359 voxels for the 1 mm BOLD contrasts from AFNI and 8 voxels for the 4 mm functional connectivity maps from MELODIC. Multiple comparisons correction was further applied for the number of contrasts performed (3 activation maps and 20 functional networks). For between-network connectivity, a Student's   t  -test with was performed between stroke participants and age-matched controls for the edge strength between each pair of seed points. Multiple comparisons FWE correction was applied for the number of pairwise   t  -tests, which was (n (n-1)/2) = (27 26/2) = 702. \n\n\n#### Correlational Analysis With Clinical Functional Scores \n  \nWe hypothesized that stroke-related differences in task-related BOLD activation and functional network spatial maps would be correlated with the clinical evaluations of sensorimotor impairment/function. A linear regression analysis was performed with each BOLD activation contrast and functional network maps as a predictor of the Box and Blocks Score for the impaired arm. No linear regressions were performed with our activation and connectivity measures and the Fugl-Meyer or the Wolf Motor scores because there was a ceiling effect in our stroke participants with the Fugl-Meyer upper extremity ( ), and the Wolf Motor correlated with the Fugl-Meyer (R = 0.87). The independent components that were compared between groups included the left and right sensorimotor networks. The   p  -values were multiplied by the number of analyzed networks to correct for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### The Search Task Produced Cortical Activation Patterns Within Motor and Multisensory Integration Areas \n  \n demonstrates that in young healthy individuals and in the age-matched control group, our search task successfully produced unique cortical activation patterns for different sensory feedback conditions. Activity is reported where the group mean is significantly positive (  t   > 2.79,   p   < 0.01, corrected). Search task-related activation common to all conditions was detected in contralateral sensorimotor cortex, bilateral premotor cortex, bilateral somatosensory association cortex, and bilateral anterior cerebellum. Purely visual or auditory activity was found in the primary visual and auditory cortices. An inferior-to-superior spatial gradient in overlapping activation maps were seen along the bilateral occipital surface. The superior occipital gyrus activity was exclusive to the unimodal auditory feedback condition. The middle occipital gyrus responded to the auditory and audiovisual conditions. \n  \nSearch-task BOLD activation maps in healthy individuals. These activations were produced from the novel search task paradigm.

Note the BOLD contrasts are shown for the movement regressors. \n  \nIn young adults, there was unique activation during the audiovisual feedback condition within the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral posterior parietal cortex, corresponding to the anterior and posterior multimodal association areas. BOLD activation in the control group that was age-matched to the stroke survivors was similar with the young healthy adults. However, this group did not have unique activation within the prefrontal and posterior parietal areas.   illiterates stroke activity and the difference between stroke and control. \n\n\n### During Sensory-Guided Movement, BOLD Activation in Stroke Survivors Depends on Sensory Feedback Modality \n  \nAs demonstrated in   and  , the BOLD activation in stroke survivors was dependent on the modality of sensory feedback. First, in the visual search condition, stroke survivors had similar activation to the age-matched controls within the active contralateral sensorimotor cortex. There was an increased activation in the contralesional prefrontal, posterior parietal, and sensorimotor cortices (  p   < 0.01, corrected). Increased activation was also observed within the ipsilesional prefrontal cortex (  p   < 0.01, corrected). Second, overall BOLD activity in stroke participants was lower than controls during the auditory feedback condition. Thirdly, the task-related BOLD activity in stroke survivors during the audiovisual search condition was significantly different from the age-matched controls in the contralesional inferior occipital gyrus and the posterior thalamic radiation. During the visual and the audiovisual search, contralesional regions positively correlated with the Box and Blocks score, with the exception of the superior temporal gyrus ( ). In the visual search task, the contralesional middle occipital gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus correlated with the Box and Blocks score; similarly, the inferior occipital and the posterior thalamic radiation correlated with the Box and Blocks score during the audiovisual task. As mentioned, the audio search task had decreased BOLD activity in the stroke group as compared to the controls, and these bilateral decreases were positively correlated with the Box and Blocks score. \n  \nBOLD activation maps of stroke vs. controls. BOLD activation in visual, auditory, and audiovisual sensory guided movement. Group-averaged activity and significant differences (  p   < 0.01, un-corrected) are shown in stroke survivors (  n   = 10) and controls (  n   = 9) on inflated brain surfaces. The three sensory feedback conditions had similar activation in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, bilateral premotor cortex, and bilateral somatosensory association cortex. Stroke participants had greater contralesional activation than controls during the visual condition and less ipsilesional activity during the auditory condition.

This network included the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, bilateral premotor cortex, and ipsilateral cerebellum, which had the highest temporal correlation with the modeled BOLD response (R = 0.716 across all participants). During both rest and the search task, this movement-related network was similar between stroke participants and age-matched controls. In controls, the participation of sensorimotor cortices became lateralized during the \u201csearch\u201d task. Both hemispheres contributed to this shift in laterality, with greater positivity in contralateral sensorimotor areas and negative coefficients in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex. There was also an increased bilateral contribution from the supplementary motor area. These task-related network changes were not seen in stroke participants. Rather, contralateral somatosensory cortex and ipsilateral SMA and ventromedial premotor cortex increased in network participation. Thus, stroke participants had greater within-network participation in the ipsilateral hemisphere during the search task. This result also held after subtracting the resting-state network values. \n  \nWithin network functional connectivity: stroke vs. control functional network maps.

The resting-state functional connectivity between left and right sensorimotor networks was lower (  p   < 0.05, corrected) in the stroke group. During both the task and resting state, functional connectivity in stroke participants showed an increase in connectivity between the sensorimotor areas and the visual areas in the occipital lobe as shown in  . During the \u201csearch\u201d task the left and right parietofrontal networks demonstrated lower between-network functional connectivity, both between the parietofrontal areas and the rest of the networks. Connections to the cerebellum ( ) were also lower in participants with stroke. \n  \nGroup differences in between network functional connectivity. An inflated pial surface of a template brain is shown with color-coded independent components and functional network graph overlay. The ipsilesional side is depicted on the left, contralesional on the right. Stroke-related increased connections are in red and decreases are in cyan. The overhead view in   (A)   shows the connectivity to the left and right sensorimotor network nodes and in   (B)   presents connectivity to the bilateral parietofrontal networks.   (C)   The posterior views show connectivity differences to four   (C)   sensorimotor network nodes, and   (D)   eight cerebellar nodes. Note that all nodes are within brain tissue, although some of the network edges are difficult to visualize. \n  \n\n### Decreased Task-Based Functional Connectivity With the Cerebellum During Sensorimotor Integration Correlates With Motor Impairment After Stroke \n  \n shows that with the \u201csearch\u201d task, decreases in network functional connectivity of the cerebellum and visual association areas were associated with Box and Blocks score in individuals with stroke. In stroke participants, the contralesional cerebellum had decreased functional connectivity with the active sensorimotor cortex as previously mentioned ( ;   p   < 0.005, corrected). As shown in  , this cortico-cerebellar connectivity was significantly and positively correlated with Box and Blocks score (  r   = 0.64). Also, the connectivity of right and left extrastriate cortical regions (V5) measured during the search task were significantly and positively correlated with Box and Blocks score (  r   = 0.82). There were no significant correlations between resting state functional connectivity and the Box and Blocks score. \n  \nFunctional trends in seed-based functional connectivity. Differences in functional connectivity in individual stroke survivors during the search task vary with Box and Blocks Score (colored number indicated on top of each brain). Note that the   z  -score is calculated as the difference in connectivity strength between the age-matched controls and the individual stroke participant. The ipsilesional side is depicted on the left, contralesional on the right. Note that all nodes are within brain tissue, although some areas in the cerebellum are difficult to visualize with this slice. \n    \nScatterplots of seed-based connectivity during \u201csearch\u201d task vs. motor function. Stroke participants are shown with black dots and controls are shown with blue triangles. The dependent variable in each plot is the partial correlation between two specified seed points. Linear regressions were performed within stroke participants and repeated across all participants (assuming that controls scored a 76). The first   r   and P  are the coefficient of variation and slope's   p  -value for the regression analysis across all participants. The second   r   and P  are associated with the analysis that included only stroke survivors. Group differences are reported by   t  -value and corresponding   P  -value. The figure shows the Box and blocks correlation with   (A)   Left M1 & Right M1 connectivity,   (B)   Left M1 & Right Crus-V1 connectivity,   (C)   Left IFS & Right IFS connectivity, and   (D)   Left V5 & Right V5 connectivity. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study provides several novel findings that advance our understanding of network function of the brain after stroke. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the search task activated different parts of the brain dependent on visual, auditory, or audiovisual cues. For instance, in order to complete the visual search task control participants used greater contralateral activation, while stroke participants used greater ipsilateral activation. The connectivity analysis of the search task revealed more stroke-related deficits as compared to resting state. Of particular interest, we found a stroke-related increase in functional connectivity between the sensorimotor and visual areas only during the search task (not resting state), suggesting stroke survivors might rely more on visual feedback for motor control. The dependence of hand function on cerebellar and sensorimotor connectivity was only detected during the search task, indicative of the importance of performing task-based functional connectivity. \n\n### Multisensory Control in Wrist Movement Evokes Activation in Bilateral Motor and Association Areas \n  \nThe activation patterns seen in the neurologically intact control group revealed that wrist movement during single and multisensory search tasks elicits activation patterns mainly in the contralateral sensorimotor, and the bilateral premotor and somatosensory association cortices ( ). As expected, the visual feedback task produced additional activation in the occipital lobe ( \u2013 ), while the auditory feedback produced activation in the temporal and superior occipital gyrus ( \u2013 ). Interestingly, the combined audiovisual condition in young adults also recruited areas in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral posterior parietal cortex. Similarly, the within-network and between-network functional connectivity also suggests that the complex search task used in the current study connects motor and association areas bilaterally, which contrasts to the lateralized contralateral activation seen in finger tapping fMRI protocols ( ,  ). This is notable in  , where the independent component network with the highest temporal correlation with the recorded movement during the search tasks included the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, the bilateral premotor cortex, and the ipsilateral cerebellum (not visible in figure). Our study shows that a search task paradigm reveals the effects of multimodal sensory feedback on brain functional networks in neurologically intact participants, providing evidence that single-joint movement during multisensory control recruits areas of the brain beyond contralateral motor regions. \n\nBrain activation was sensitive to the search task fMRI paradigm in stroke participants. As seen in  , stroke participants' task-related activation was dependent on the type of sensory feedback. Stroke participants had increased activation in the bilateral prefrontal cortex, and contralesional posterior parietal and sensorimotor cortices during the visual search condition. During auditory feedback, stroke participants had reduced ipsilesional activity. In the combined audiovisual search task, activation of the inferior occipital and the posterior temporal gyri was significantly reduced in stroke, and activation of these regions positively correlated with the Box and Blocks score ( ). These results suggest that task-related activation is sensory-dependent, and that multisensory integration is impacted by stroke ( ). \n\nFunctional connectivity was also dependent on the search task in the current study. The within-network functional connectivity results suggest that stroke participants engage bilateral motor regions to a higher extent to complete the search task.   shows that the functional connectivity within the ipsilateral sensorimotor network was greater during the search task as compared to rest in stroke participants. Whereas, the sensorimotor cortices in the neurologically intact group became more lateralized toward the contralateral hemisphere, the stroke group had greater within network participation in the ipsilateral hemisphere during the search task, suggesting that stroke participants engage bilateral motor networks during a search task and wrist movement. This observation is consistent with prior reports on brain activation ( ,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Task-Based Functional Connectivity Provides Unique Information About Sensorimotor Integration and Motor Control After Stroke \n  \nConsistent with our hypothesis, the search task revealed \u201clocal specialization\u201d as evidenced by increased within-network functional connectivity, and greater between-network connectivity after stroke. The control group saw an increase in within-network connectivity in the contralateral sensorimotor areas and bilateral SMA ( ). As shown in  , cortical areas within the ipsilateral sensorimotor network were lower during the search task in control participants, further suggesting task-related inhibition of the ipsilateral cortex in healthy individuals and lateralization toward the contralateral hemisphere ( ). The increase in bilateral SMA contributions to the sensorimotor network with the task might be due to the strong reciprocal connections between the left and right SM ( ). In contrast, the stroke group saw increased within network connectivity in the ipsilateral SMA and ventromedial premotor areas during the search task ( ). Due to lesion location in the contralateral hemisphere, stroke participants were unlikely to be able to increase contralateral cortical participation in the SM network with the task. Thus, the stroke group appeared to produce local reorganization in the ipsilateral side. \n\nThe task-based fMRI revealed stroke-related network connectivity changes that positively correlated with motor impairment ( ). The resting-state functional connectivity between left and right sensorimotor networks was lower (  p   < 0.05) in the stroke group, which is consistent with other reports of decreased interhemispheric connectivity after stroke ( ); however, these changes were not correlated with the box and blocks scores ( ). During the \u201csearch\u201d task, reduced functional connectivity between the left and right V5 was strongly correlated with the box and blocks score in stroke individuals ( ). Additionally, the functional connectivity between the middle temporal gyrus and parietofrontal nodes showed stroke-related increases ( ). The middle temporal gyrus has been shown to play a role in processing motion-related visual information ( ). \n\n\n### Clinical Correlations During the Search Task Reveal Sensorimotor Integration Deficits in Stroke \n  \nA unique finding in this study is a stroke-related increase in functional connectivity between the sensorimotor and visual areas during a search task, suggesting that stroke survivors may rely on visual feedback for motor control. During the auditory feedback conditions, stroke participant's auditory cortex was less active ( ;  ). In contrast, ipsilesional cortical activity was more widespread in stroke participants than controls during the visuomotor task. While auditory feedback has been shown to improve weight bearing and gait characteristics in stroke survivors ( ), individuals with stroke have been shown to rely on visual feedback for posturing ( ). Additionally, visual feedback during grip-force control increases activation in the visual cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor areas, and the ipsilateral cerebellum in stroke participants ( ), and limb apraxia has been associated with a deficit in visuo-motor integration due to lesions in the fronto-parietal motor network ( ). The findings suggest that visual information during a complex motor task is an important source of feedback in stroke survivors and highlights the importance of measuring brain activation and calculating between-network connectivity during task-state fMRI. \n\nAlthough the results showed an effect during visual feedback that was not present during the auditory condition, it would be overreaching to conclude that stroke survivors are more sensitive to visual over auditory feedback during fine-motor control. We do not know the visual vs. auditory sensitivity in each subject, which is information that would require a psychophysical exam. Although we did not record the dB gain of the maximum auditory feedback, a reasonable volume was used during the experiment. The volume was set such that the subject reported that the auditory feedback could be heard. \n\nIn addition to identifying stroke participant's dependence on visual feedback for motor control, this work emphasized the importance of cerebellar functional connectivity after stroke, specifically during sensorimotor integration. As indicated in  , the bilateral cerebellum exhibited stroke-related decreases in functional connectivity during both at rest and during the search task. Additionally, the connectivity between the ipsilateral cerebellar crus VI and the contralateral M1 was positively correlated with the box and blocks score when tested using the search task ( ). Involvement of the cerebellum in different networks involving movement and multisensory integration give it a critical role in brain plasticity after stroke ( ). The motor cortex and cerebellum together have been shown to be involved in plasticity during motor training and in sensorimotor integration ( ). Past imaging studies have shown that the connectivity between the cerebellum and parietofrontal areas are related to post-stroke motor function ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Study Limitations \n  \nThis study is limited by its small sample size for each group, especially for the age matched control and stroke participants. Head motion is a potential confounding factor in any study using functional activity or connectivity MRI, especially those involving task-based paradigms and patient populations. Indeed, head motion has been found in past studies to be greater in patients than in controls, and also increases with age ( ). Van Dijk et al. found that although most variability in functional connectivity is not associated with head movement, there is significantly reduced functional coupling between the parietofrontal and default-mode network nodes in young adults. Furthermore, greater mean head motion leads to increased local functional coupling and interhemispheric connectivity between sensorimotor areas. Stroke participants in this study had significantly greater mean head motion than controls (  p   < 0.05) at rest and during the search task. Thus, our findings that stroke survivors had decreased between-network connectivity to the bilateral parietofrontal networks and increased within-network connectivity contralesionally could be in part due to increased head motion. However, we observed decreased interhemispheric connectivity, opposite to what was observed by Van Dijk et al. Since head motion was regressed out of the original data before our seed-based analysis, we do not believe that it was the prime contributor to our findings. \n\nChanges in vasculature after stroke can lead to differences in neurovascular coupling near the lesion, which may influence correlations of these voxels with distant areas. Differences in brain structure can have an impact on functional connectivity metrics due to changes in the partial volume of gray matter ( ). Using simulations, Dukart and Bertolino showed that between-group differences in brain structure leads to significant differences in functional connectivity between the groups. Due to the large variability in lesion location in this study, partial volume was not expected to have a significant impact on functional connectivity results. \n\nNon-stroke related lateralization of cortical activation and functional connectivity is a potential confounding factor in this study. Studies of healthy adults have shown significant lateralization of resting-state functional connectivity ( ). Nielson et al. showed that there are 20 \u201clateralization hubs\u201d that have the most lateralized functional connectivity. Some of these hubs included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, Broca's area, insula, and junctions between the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes. Many of these regions are unimodal and multimodal sensory association areas. Handedness of our participants and the procedures of flipping the brain over the mid-sagittal plane to place all lesions on the same side of the brain could have had an impact on the results. \n\nSpatial group differences in BOLD contrasts and functional connectivity could have been affected by group differences in the level of head motion during the task. The fsl_motion_outliers program in the FMRIB Software Library was used to estimate mean frame-wise displacement (FD) and mean square of successive differences (DVARS) ( ) from the BOLD data during the search task runs of each subject. Shown in  , both metrics of head motion were significantly different (  p   < 0.01) between groups, but neither DVARS (r2 = 0.02) nor FD (r2 = 0.08) were correlated with Box and Blocks score. Although head motion regressors were included in all fMRI analyses in this study, greater motion in stroke subjects may have reduced the peak values of the functional connectivity maps. \n\nDifferences between study groups in range of wrist movement, and task performance could also impact the interpretation of our imaging findings. We report the number of completed search-task trials as a rough estimate of performance in  . On average, stroke subjects completed 49.4 trials, which was significantly (  p   < 0.01) >61.1 trials completed in age-matched controls. However, the number of completed trials did not correlate (r2 = 0.04) with the Box and Blocks score. Shown in  , the number of search trials ( ) and the average error accumulated ( ) was not correlated with the box and blocks scores. Shown in  , the range of wrist motion was not significantly different between groups nor correlated with Box and Blocks score in stroke subjects. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, our novel functional MRI task paradigm involving wrist movement and multisensory feedback revealed changes in BOLD activation and functional connectivity after stroke, suggesting that task-based fMRI can highlight alterations in brain functional networks after stroke. We documented widespread bilateral activation in neurologically intact participants during an audiovisual search task, indicating that multisensory wrist control recruits primary motor and association areas. In contrast, stroke participant's activation patterns were task dependent; visual feedback produced increased contralesional activation compared to controls, while auditory feedback resulted in decreased activation ipsilesionally. Additionally, our within-network functional connectivity analysis detected a task-related lateralization to contralateral sensorimotor regions in control participants that was not found in stroke. Lastly, between-network functional connectivity during the search task revealed decreased connectivity between the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex and the contralesional cerebellum, and between interhemispheric V5 regions, which both correlated with box and blocks scores of hand function. These results suggest that task-based functional connectivity provides detail on changes in brain networks in stroke survivors. The data also highlight the importance of cerebellar connections for recovery of arm function after stroke. Future work will investigate the role of structural connectivity in these mechanistic changes between sensorimotor and sensory integration networks. \n\n\n## Data Availability \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this manuscript will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Institutional Review Boards of the Medical College of Wisconsin and Marquette University with written informed consent from all subjects.

{"text": "Harris, Sam and Kaplan, Jonas T. and Curiel, Ashley and Bookheimer, Susan Y. and Iacoboni, Marco and Cohen, Mark S.\nPLoS One, 2009\n\n# Title\n\nThe Neural Correlates of Religious and Nonreligious Belief\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nWhile religious faith remains one of the most significant features of human life, little is known about its relationship to ordinary belief at the level of the brain. Nor is it known whether religious believers and nonbelievers differ in how they evaluate statements of fact. Our lab previously has used functional neuroimaging to study belief as a general mode of cognition  , and others have looked specifically at religious belief  . However, no research has compared these two states of mind directly. \n\n\n## Methodology/Principal Findings \n  \nWe used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure signal changes in the brains of thirty subjects\u2014fifteen committed Christians and fifteen nonbelievers\u2014as they evaluated the truth and falsity of religious and nonreligious propositions. For both groups, and in both categories of stimuli, belief (judgments of \u201ctrue\u201d vs judgments of \u201cfalse\u201d) was associated with greater signal in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, an area important for self-representation  ,  ,  ,  , emotional associations  , reward  ,  ,  , and goal-driven behavior  . This region showed greater signal whether subjects believed statements about God, the Virgin Birth, etc. or statements about ordinary facts. A comparison of both stimulus categories suggests that religious thinking is more associated with brain regions that govern emotion, self-representation, and cognitive conflict, while thinking about ordinary facts is more reliant upon memory retrieval networks. \n\n\n## Conclusions/Significance \n  \nWhile religious and nonreligious thinking differentially engage broad regions of the frontal, parietal, and medial temporal lobes, the difference between belief and disbelief appears to be content-independent. Our study compares religious thinking with ordinary cognition and, as such, constitutes a step toward developing a neuropsychology of religion. However, these findings may also further our understanding of how the brain accepts statements of all kinds to be valid descriptions of the world. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSince the 19  century, it has been widely assumed that the spread of industrialized society would spell the end of religion. Marx  , Freud  ,  , and Weber  \u2014along with innumerable anthropologists, sociologists, historians, and psychologists influenced by their work\u2014expected religious belief to wither in the light of modernity. It has not come to pass. Religion remains one of the most prominent features of human life in the 21  century. While most developed societies have grown predominantly secular  , with the curious exception of the United States, orthodox religion is in full bloom throughout the developing world. Indeed, humanity seems to becoming proportionally more religious, as the combination of material advancement and secularism is strongly correlated with decreased fertility  . When one considers the rise of Islamism throughout the Muslim world, the spread of Pentecostalism throughout Africa, and the anomalous piety of the United States, it becomes clear that religion will have geopolitical consequences well into the 21st century. \n\nGiven the importance of religion in human life, surprisingly little is known about its basis in the brain. The relevance of the brain's ventromedial dopaminergic systems to religious experience, belief and behavior is suggested by several lines of evidence, including the fact that a variety of clinical conditions related to dopaminergic dysfunction\u2014mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia, and temporal-lobe epilepsy\u2014are regularly associated with hyperreligiosity  . The serotonergic system has also been implicated, as drugs known to modulate it\u2014like LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (\u201cDMT\u201d), and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (\u201cecstasy\u201d)\u2014seem especially potent drivers of religious/spiritual experience. In addition, 5-HT1A receptor densities have been inversely correlated with high scores on the \u201cspiritual acceptance\u201d subscale of the Temperament and Character Inventory  . \n\nThere have been a number of neuroimaging and EEG studies done on religious practice and experience\u2014primarily focusing on meditation  ,  ,  ,  ,   and prayer  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  . The purpose of these studies has been to evoke spiritual/contemplative experiences in religious subjects and to compare these states of mind to a control condition. However, none of these studies were designed to isolate the variable of belief itself, or to determine whether religious belief differs from ordinary belief at the level of the brain. \n\nAs many have noted, religion cannot be reduced to a mere concatenation of religious beliefs. Every religion consists of rites, rituals, prayers, social institutions, holidays, etc., that serve a wide variety of purposes, explicit or otherwise  ,  . However, religious   belief  \u2014that is, the acceptance of specific religious propositions as being true\u2014is generally what renders these enterprises relevant, or even comprehensible. While there may be many Catholics, for instance, who value the ritual of the Mass without actually believing the doctrine of Transubstantiation, the primacy of the Mass within the Church still hinges on the fact that many Catholics do accept it as a metaphysical truth\u2014a fact that can be directly attributed to specific, doctrinal claims that are still put forward by the Church. There is, of course, a distinction to be made between mere   profession   of such beliefs and actual   belief  \u2014a distinction that, while important, only makes sense in a world in which some people actually believe what they say they believe. There seems little reason to doubt that a significant percentage of human beings, likely a majority, falls into this latter category with respect one or another religious creed. \n\nOur lab published the first neuroimaging study of belief as a general mode of cognition  , and another group has looked specifically at religious conviction  . However, no research has compared these two states of mind directly. Here we show that while religious and nonreligious thinking differentially engage broad regions of the frontal, parietal, and medial temporal lobes\u2014and, hence, appear quite distinct as modes of thought\u2014the difference between belief and disbelief appears to be content-independent. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure signal changes in the brains of thirty subjects\u2014fifteen committed Christians and fifteen nonbelievers\u2014as they evaluated the truth and falsity of religious and nonreligious propositions. For each trial either a religious statement (  e.g.  , \u201cJesus Christ really performed the miracles attributed to him in the Bible\u201d) or a nonreligious statement (  e.g.  , \u201cAlexander the Great was a very famous military leader\u201d) appeared, and participants pressed a button to indicate whether the statement was true or false. Our stimuli were designed to produce roughly equal numbers of believed and disbelieved trials in each category. \n\n### Behavioral data \n  \nResponse time data were submitted to a repeated-measures ANOVA with belief (true, false) and statement content (religious, nonreligious) as within-subject variables, and group (nonbeliever, Christian) as a between-subject variable. Response times were significantly longer for false (3.95 s) compared to true (3.70 s) responses (F (1,28)\u200a=\u200a33.4, p<.001), and also significantly longer for religious (3.99 s) compared with nonreligious (3.66 s) stimuli (F (1,28)\u200a=\u200a18, p<.001). The two-way interaction between belief and content type did not reach significance, but there was a three-way interaction between belief, content type, and group (F (1,28)\u200a=\u200a6.06, p<.05). While both groups were quicker to respond \u201ctrue\u201d than \u201cfalse\u201d on both categories of stimuli, the effect of truth was especially pronounced for nonbelievers when responding to religious statements (see Supplementary Information:   and  ). \n\n\n### Belief compared with disbelief \n  \nFor both groups, and in both categories of stimuli, belief was associated with greater blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC, see  ,  ), an area important for self-representation  ,  ,  ,  , emotional associations  , reward  ,  ,  , and goal-driven behavior  . This region showed greater signal whether subjects believed statements about God, the Virgin Birth, etc. or statements about ordinary facts. We also saw greater signal in the left superior frontal gyrus and in both lateral occipital cortices for this contrast. \n   Belief minus disbelief (Both Categories; Both Groups).  \nGreater signal for belief compared with disbelief appeared in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, lateral occipital cortex, and superior frontal gyrus. The bottom panel shows percent signal change from baseline in each of the clusters (vmpc\u200a=\u200aventromedial prefrontal cortex; log\u200a=\u200alateral occipital gyrus; sfg\u200a=\u200asuperior frontal gyrus). Error bars represent standard error of the mean. \n     Belief minus disbelief.      \nThe differences in VMPFC signal were due to a greater relative decrease in activation from baseline for the disbelief condition. Our finding of greater signal in VMPFC for belief compared to disbelief was significant in both Christians and nonbelievers for both religious and nonreligious stimuli, supporting a role for this brain region in the acceptance of truth-claims across content domains. A direct comparison of   belief minus disbelief   in Christians and nonbelievers did not show any significant group differences for nonreligious stimuli. For religious stimuli, there were additional regions of the brain that did differ by group, however these results seem best explained by a common reaction in both groups to statements that violate religious doctrines (discussed further below). \n\nThe opposite contrast,   disbelief minus belief  , yielded increased signal in the superior frontal sulcus and the precentral gyrus. The engagement of these areas is not readily explained on the basis of prior work (see  ). \n   Disbelief minus belief.      \n\n### Religious compared with Nonreligious statements \n  \nWhile the contrast of   belief minus disbelief   yielded similar activation patterns for both stimulus categories, a comparison of all religious trials to all nonreligious trials produced a wide range of signal differences throughout the brain. The contrast of   religious stimuli minus nonreligious stimuli   (see  ,  .) revealed greater signal in many regions, including the anterior insula and the ventral striatum. The anterior insula has been regularly linked to pain perception   and even to the perception of pain in others  . This region is also widely believed to mediate negatively valenced feelings like disgust  ,  . The ventral striatum is also regularly associated with emotional processing, especially with reward   and appears to play a role in cognitive planning  . We also found greater signal for religious stimuli in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC is often taken to be a reporter of response conflict  , and activity in this region has been negatively correlated with religious conviction  . \n   Religious versus nonreligious statements.  \n(A) The MRI signal was greater when subjects evaluated religious statements compared with nonreligious statements in areas throughout the brain, including the precuneus, anterior cingulate, insula, and ventral striatum. (B) Increased signal was found for nonreligious statements compared with religious statements in several left hemisphere regions including the parahippocampal gyrus, retrosplenial cortex, temporal pole, middle temporal gyrus and hippocampus. \n     Religious minus nonreligious statements.      \nAnother key region that appears to be preferentially engaged by religious thinking is the posterior medial cortex. This area is part of the previously described resting state network that shows greater activity during both rest and self-referential tasks  . \n\nThe opposite contrast,   nonreligious minus religious statements  , produced greater signal in left hemisphere networks, including the hippocampus, the parahippocampal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole, and retrosplenial cortex (see  ,  ). It is well known that the hippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus are involved in memory retrieval  . The anterior temporal lobe is also engaged by semantic memory tasks  , and the retrosplenial cortex displays especially strong, reciprocal connectivity with structures in the medial temporal lobe  . \n   Nonreligious minus Religious statements.      \nFinally, among our religious stimuli, the subset of statements that ran counter to Christian doctrine yielded greater signal for both groups in several brain regions, including the ventral striatum, paracingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus, the frontal poles, and inferior parietal cortex (see  ,  ). These regions showed greater signal both when Christians rejected stimuli contrary to their doctrine (e.g. \u201cThe Biblical god is a myth\u201d) and when nonbelievers affirmed the truth of those same statements. In other words, these brain areas responded preferentially to \u201cblasphemous\u201d statements in both subject groups. This contrast is the result of a double subtraction on religious trials: (Nonbeliever True\u2212Nonbeliever False)\u2212(Christian True\u2212Christian False)\u200a=\u200aNT\u2212NF\u2212CT+CF\u200a=\u200aNT+CF\u2212NF\u2212CT\u200a=\u200a(NT+CF)\u2212(NF + CT). The opposite contrast: (NF\u2212NT)\u2212(CF\u2212CT) produced a null result. \n   Reponses to blasphemy in both groups.  \nThere were significant differences between blasphemous and non-blasphemous statements in both groups. These are regions that show greater signal both when Christians reject stimuli contrary to their doctrine (e.g. \u201cThe Biblical god is a myth\u201d) and when nonbelievers affirm their belief in those same statements (pc\u200a=\u200aparacingulate gyrus; mf\u200a=\u200amiddle frontal gyrus; vs\u200a=\u200aventral striatum; ip\u200a=\u200ainferior parietal lobe; fp\u200a=\u200afrontal pole). Error bars represent standard error of the mean. \n     Double subtraction (\u201cblasphemy\u201d contrast).      \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nNearly a century of opinion polling attests that 70\u201385 percent of Americans profess not merely a belief in a generic God, but a belief in highly specific, religious propositions: that the Bible is the word of God (whether literal or \u201cinspired\u201d), that Jesus Christ will physically return to earth at some point in the future, that Satan exists and leads people to sin, that prayers actually get answered, etc. The failure to subject such beliefs to rational criticism may be one reason for their survival. But, as Boyer  ,   points out, the failure of reality testing cannot explain the specific character of religious beliefs. According to Boyer, religious beliefs and concepts must arise from mental categories and cognitive propensities that predate religion\u2014and these underlying structures might determine the stereotypical form that religious beliefs and practices take. These categories relate to things like intentional agents, animacy, social exchange, moral intuitions, natural hazards, and ways of understanding human misfortune. On Boyer's account, people do not accept implausible religious doctrines because they have relaxed their standards of rationality; they relax their standards of rationality because certain doctrines fit their \u201cinference machinery\u201d in such a way as to seem credible. And what most religious propositions may lack in plausibility they make up for in the degree to which they are memorable, emotionally salient, and socially consequential; all of these properties are a product of our underlying cognitive architecture, and most of this architecture is not consciously accessible. Boyer argues, therefore, that explicit theologies and consciously held beliefs are not a reliable indicator of the contents or causes of a person's religious outlook. \n\nBoyer may be correct in saying that we have cognitive templates for religious ideas that run deeper than culture (in the same way that we appear to have deep, abstract concepts like \u201canimal\u201d and \u201ctool\u201d). We may, in fact, be what Bloom   has called \u201ccommon sense dualists\u201d\u2014that is, we may be constitutionally inclined to see mind as distinct from body and, therefore, will tend to intuit the existence of disembodied minds at work in the world. This could lead us to presume ongoing relationships with dead friends and relatives, to anticipate our own survival of death, and to generally conceive of people as having immaterial souls. \n\nA variety of experiments suggest that children are predisposed to assume both design and intention behind natural events\u2014leaving many psychologists and anthropologists to believe that children, left entirely to their own devices, would invent some conception of God  . The psychologist Margaret Evans has found that children between the ages of eight and ten, whatever their upbringing, are consistently more inclined to give a Creationist account of the natural world than their parents are  . \n\nBecause our minds have evolved to detect patterns in the world, we may tend to detect patterns that aren't actually there\u2014ranging from faces in the clouds to a divine hand in the workings of Nature. Hood   posits an additional cognitive schema that he calls \u201csupersense\u201d\u2014a tendency to infer hidden forces in the world, working for good or for ill. On his account, supersense generates beliefs in the supernatural (religious and otherwise) all on its own, and such beliefs are thereafter modulated, rather than instilled, by culture. Hood likens our susceptibility to religious ideas to our propensity to develop phobias for evolutionarily relevant threats (like snakes and spiders) rather than for things that are far more likely to kill us (like automobiles and electrical sockets). Barrett   makes the same case, likening religion to language acquisition: we come into this world cognitively prepared for language; our culture and upbringing merely dictate which languages we will be exposed to. \n\nAnd yet, however predisposed the human mind may be to harboring religious beliefs, it remains a fact that each new generation receives a religious worldview, at least in part, in the form of linguistic propositions\u2014far more so in some societies than in others. Whatever the evolutionary underpinnings of religion, it seems unlikely that there is a genetic explanation for the why the French, Swedes, and Japanese tend not to believe in the God of Abraham while Americans, Saudis, and Somalis do. The importance of religious doctrines that purport to be true, and their subsequent acceptance as true by great numbers of human beings, seems indisputable. \n\nRecent attempts to study the neural correlates of religious belief have either suffered from a lack of a nonreligious control condition   or were not designed to isolate the variable of belief at all  . To investigate the neural correlates of belief for both religious and nonreligious modes of thought, we asked Christians and nonbelievers to evaluate statements of both types while in the MRI scanner. \n\nThe data reported above present statistical tests of the reliability of signal changes occurring throughout the brain as a function of the stimuli and their associated behavioral responses. However, these data are of greater value when interpreted against related results in the neuroscientific literature. Such a discussion necessarily entails \u201creverse inference\u201d of a sort often considered problematic in the field of neuroimaging  . One cannot reliably infer the presence of a mental state on the basis of brain data alone, unless the brain regions in question are known to be truly selective for a single state of mind. As the brain is an evolved organ, with higher order states emerging from lower order mechanisms, very few of its regions are so selective as to fully justify inferences of this kind. Nevertheless, our results appear to make at least provisional sense of the emotional tone of belief. And whatever larger role our regions of interest play in human cognition and behavior, they appear to respond similarly to putative statements of fact, irrespective of content, in the brains of both religious believers and nonbelievers. \n\nThe contrast,   belief minus disbelief  , revealed greater BOLD signal in the VMPFC (see  ,  ). The medial prefrontal cortex is known to have a high level of resting state activity and to show reduced activity compared to baseline for a wide variety of cognitive tasks  . BOLD signal in this region has often been associated with self-representation, particularly for verbal stimuli  : for instance, one sees smaller decreases in activity from baseline when subjects make judgments about themselves than when they make judgments about others  . This region has also been implicated in reward-related processing  . The smaller decrease in activity for belief compared to disbelief could reflect the greater self-relevance and/or reward value of true statements. \n\nOur study was designed to produce high concordance on nonreligious stimuli (  e.g.  , \u201cEagles really exist\u201d) and high discordance on religious stimuli (  e.g.  , \u201cAngels really exist\u201d). The fact that we found essentially the same signal maps for   belief minus disbelief   in both groups, on both categories of content, argues strongly for the content-independence of belief and disbelief as cognitive processes. Despite the fact that religious believers and nonbelievers accepted and rejected diametrically opposite statements in half of our experimental trials, the same neural systems were engaged in both groups throughout. This would seem to rule out the possibility that these results could be explained by any property of the stimuli apart from their being deemed \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d by the subjects in our study. The involvement of the VMPFC for belief is consistent with our earlier findings  . \n\nIn our earlier study of belief, we found anterior insula signal to be associated with the contrast   disbelief minus belief  . Kapogiannis et al.   also found signal in the insula to be correlated with the rejection of religious statements deemed false. The significance of the anterior insula for negative affect/appraisal has been discussed above. Because Kapogiannis et al. did not include a nonreligious control condition in their experiment, they interpreted the insula's recruitment as a sign that violations of religious doctrine might provoke \u201caversion, guilt, or fear of loss\u201d in people of faith. Reducing the statistical thresholding in our present study did nominate the insula as a region of interest for disbelief, in both groups and on both categories of stimuli. However, these areas of signal did not survive our cluster thresholding. \n\nOur previous study of belief, in which we explicitly modeled uncertainty, revealed greater signal in the ACC and adjacent regions of the superior frontal gyrus in the uncertainty condition. Given that our signal maps in the contrast   religious minus nonreligious   elicited this same pattern, we speculate that both groups experienced greater cognitive conflict and uncertainty while evaluating religious statements. In support of this conjecture, we also note that our religious stimuli, while semantically and grammatically well matched to our nonreligious stimuli, incurred longer response times for both groups. This contrast also showed bilateral signal in the striatum and the anterior insulae. It is perhaps not surprising that the evaluation of religious statements would more fully engage regions of the brain responsive to emotional salience, both positive and negative. \n\nThe contrast   religious minus nonreligious   also showed increased signal in the medial parietal regions regularly associated with self-referential tasks. We note that a possible difference between responding to our religious and nonreligious stimuli is that, for both groups, a person's answers could serve to affirm his or her identity: i.e. for every religious trial, Christians were explicitly affirming their religious worldview, while nonbelievers were explicitly denying the truth-claims of religion. \n\nThe opposite contrast,   nonreligious minus religious  , showed increased signal in left hemisphere memory networks. Thus, judgments about the nonreligious stimuli presented in our study seemed more dependent upon those brain systems involved in accessing stored knowledge. \n\nFinally, there were several regions that showed greater signal in both groups in response to \u201cblasphemous\u201d statements (i.e. those that ran counter to Christian doctrine). The ventral striatum signal in this contrast suggests that decisions about these stimuli may have been more rewarding for both groups: Nonbelievers may take special pleasure in making assertions that explicitly negate religious doctrine, while Christians may enjoy rejecting such statements as false. \n\nThere is, of course, no reason to expect that any regions of the human brain are dedicated solely to belief and disbelief. Nevertheless, our work suggests that these opposing states of cognition can be discriminated by functional neuroimaging and are intimately tied to networks involved in self-representation and reward. Despite vast differences in the underlying processing responsible for religious and nonreligious modes of thought, the distinction between believing and disbelieving a proposition appears to transcend content. These results may have many areas of application\u2014ranging from the neuropsychology of religion, to the use of \u201cbelief-detection\u201d as a surrogate for \u201clie-detection,\u201d to understanding how the practice of science itself, and truth-claims generally, emerge from the biology of the human brain. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Experimental Subjects \n  \nWe enrolled 54 subjects who were (1) between the ages of 18\u201330, (2) not taking anti-depressants, (3) neurologically healthy, (4) free of obvious psychiatric illness or suicidal ideation, and (5) native speakers of English as their first language. These inclusion/exclusion criteria sought to remove confounding effects of (1&2) age- or drug-related hypometabolism in the brain, (3) structural and functional anomalies due to illness or injury, (4) differences in psychological health, and (5) differences in linguistic processing. Subjects with implanted metal are routinely excluded from experiments using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for reasons of safety. All subjects gave written, informed consent according to the guidelines of the UCLA Human Subjects Protection Committee. \n\nIn order to implement these inclusion/exclusion criteria, subjects were screened by means of a telephone questionnaire. This questionnaire allowed us to isolate the variable of religious belief, in an effort to admit only dedicated Christians and nonbelievers into the protocol. \n\nOnce we had two groups of subjects (Christians and Nonbelievers), we attempted to balance these groups with respect to 1) general reasoning ability, 2) age, and 3) years of education. We also sought to exclude all subjects who exhibited signs of psychopathology. To this end we assessed subjects' general intelligence using the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) and screened for psychopathology using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Subjects were not given the results of these tests. \n\nThirteen subjects were excluded on the basis of these psychological assessments. This left us with 41 subjects (19 female, 22 male; 20 Christians; 21 Nonbelievers). Forty of these participated in the fMRI portion of our study, but ten were later dropped, and their data excluded from subsequent analysis, due to technical difficulties with their scans (2 subjects), or to achieve a gender balance between the two groups (1 subject), or because their responses to our experimental stimuli indicated that they did not actually meet the criteria for inclusion in our study as either nonbelievers or committed Christians (7 subjects). \n\nWhile gradations of belief are certainly worth investigating, our experiment sought to characterize belief and disbelief in their purest form. It was, therefore, essential that we exclude subjects who could not consistently respond \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d with conviction. Our decision to exclude data from subjects whose answers were not consistent with our pre-screening criteria was part of our original design and was not made based on any evaluation of the scanning data (the fMRI data from these subjects were never analyzed). While we adopted the criteria of excluding anyone who responded to one category of statements with less than 90% predictability, the 7 subjects who were excluded on this basis had responses that ranged from 22% to 43% discord with the expected responses. (For instance, one subject who passed our initial screening as a nonbeliever actually agreed with 43% of the religious Christian statements once inside the scanner.) Because our telephone questionnaire needed to screen for all relevant variables (age, native language, MRI safety issues, etc.), it contained only a very abbreviated assessment of belief. Thus, the high exclusion rate at this later stage of the experiment represents the failure of our brief screening procedure to accurately assess a person's religious beliefs, rather than a bias in our approach to data analysis. These exclusions ensured that our final group of subjects did, in fact, strongly believe/disbelieve our religious stimuli. We note, however, that the subjects retained in this experiment do not represent the full range of religious commitment found in the general population. \n\nOur final study consisted of data acquired from 30 subjects (15 Christians; 15 Nonbelievers; 7 men and 8 women in each group). The mean full-scale WASI scores, years of education, and ages for the groups appear in  . \n   Subject Data: The mean full-scale WASI scores, years of education, and ages for all subjects retained in this experiment.      \n\n### Experimental design \n  \nOnce inside the scanner, subjects were presented with a series of short statements through a video-goggle display (Resonance Technology, Inc). After reading each statement, they were asked to evaluate its truth content with the press of a button, indicating \u201ctrue\u201d (belief), \u201cfalse\u201d (disbelief), and \u201cundecidable\u201d (uncertainty). The presentation of stimuli was self-paced. Stimuli were drawn from two categories, religious and nonreligious. All statements were designed to be judged easily as \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d (the response of \u201cundecidable,\u201d while available to subjects, was not expected). \n\nWithin each category, we attempted to balance the stimuli with respect to semantic structure and content. Strict balancing across categories was not possible, however, as the two categories differ with respect to content, in principle. For the purposes of stimulus design (not presentation) we generated our statements in groups of four (true and false; religious and nonreligious): \n\n The Biblical God really exists.  \u2003(Christian true/nonbeliever false) \n\n The Biblical God is a myth.  \u2003(Christian false/nonbeliever true) \n\n Santa Claus is a myth.  \u2003(Both groups true) \n\n Santa Claus really exists.  \u2003(Both groups false) \n\nChristians and Nonbelievers were expected to respond identically to nonreligious stimuli and to be discordant for all religious trials. The nature of the questions, along with a telephone screening protocol that selected for nonbelievers and committed Christians, more or less ensured that subjects' responses would segregate in this way (see Supplementary Information:  ). \n\nPrior to scanning, all stimuli were tested to ensure that they would function appropriately in our experiment. For this purpose, we created several sets of candidate stimuli and solicited responses from the nonbelievers and Christians on the Internet. For each statement the number of respondents averaged around 5000, 80\u201390% of whom were nonbelievers. The numbers of committed Christians responding to each statement ranged from 254\u2013787. Participants were asked to judge the veracity of each statement using a Likert scale (ranging from 1-\u201cstrongly disbelieve\u201d to 5-\u201cstrongly believe\u201d). In selecting stimuli for this study, we retained only those statements that reliably elicited ratings of 1 or 5 in these surveys. We kept only those religious statements that segregated along the lines of stated belief (Christian v. nonbeliever), and only those nonreligious statements that showed no such interaction. \n\nEach functional scan was balanced with respect to category content (religious/nonreligous) and response valence (true/false). After scanning, subjects were asked to review their recorded responses to all statements to ensure that they reflected their actual beliefs at the time of scanning. Erroneous responses, responses of \u201cundecided,\u201d or those statements which, upon debriefing, could not be clearly judged by subjects to be \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d were excluded from subsequent data analysis. \n\nThe stimuli were presented in an order optimized to produce maximal signal differentiation and to ensure temporal jitter between trials using a genetic optimization algorithm  . Jitter was achieved by interspersing the task trials with fixation trials in an order determined by the genetic algorithm. The presentation of each of three stimulus sets was randomized for each subject. For the purposes of data analysis, an experimental trial began the moment a statement appeared and ended with each subject's response. \n\n\n### Functional MRI Data Acquisition \n  \nAll scanning was performed on a Siemens Trio 3T scanner. Each subject received three functional scans of approximately 6 to 10 minutes in length. Functional images were acquired in the AC-PC orientation using T2*-weighted echo-planar scans (TR\u200a=\u200a2000 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a35 ms, flip angle\u200a=\u200a80 degrees, FOV\u200a=\u200a192\u00d7192 mm, slice thickness\u200a=\u200a3 mm, number of slices\u200a=\u200a29, inter-slice gap\u200a=\u200a1 mm, bandwidth\u200a=\u200a3256 Hz/pixel). FMRI data processing was carried out using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) Version 5.98, part of FSL (FMRIB's Software Library,  ). Registration to high resolution structural and to standard space images was carried out using FLIRT  ,  ,  . We used FLIRT to register the functional data to the atlas space in three stages. First, functional images were aligned with the high-resolution co-planar T2-weighted image (TR\u200a=\u200a5000 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a31 ms, flip angle\u200a=\u200a90 degrees, FOV\u200a=\u200a200\u00d7200 mm, slice thickness\u200a=\u200a3 mm, slices\u200a=\u200a29, inter-slice gap\u200a=\u200a1 mm, bandwidth\u200a=\u200a1628) using 6 degrees of freedom rigid-body warping procedure. Next, the co-planar volume was registered to the T1-weighted MP-RAGE (TR\u200a=\u200a1900 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a3.43 ms, TI\u200a=\u200a900 ms, flip angle\u200a=\u200a9 degrees, FOV\u200a=\u200a256\u00d7256 mm, slice thickness\u200a=\u200a1 mm, number of slices\u200a=\u200a160, inter-slice gap\u200a=\u200a.5 mm, bandwidth\u200a=\u200a180 Hz/pixel) using a six degrees of freedom rigid-body warp. Finally, the MP-RAGE was registered to the standard MNI atlas with a twelve degrees of freedom affine transformation. Registration from high resolution structural to standard space was then further refined using FNIRT nonlinear registration  ,  . \n\n\n### Functional MRI Data Analysis \n  \nAll functional data were analyzed using FSL. We performed standard preprocessing\u2014slice timing correction, motion correction, brain extraction, spatial smoothing (using a 5 mm kernel), high-pass filtering, and pre-whitening\u2014prior to contrast modeling. Individual responses were analyzed in an event-related manner. We modeled four types of trials with separate regressors: nonreligious true, nonreligious false, religious true, and religious false. Since response time varied among conditions, we also included in our model an additional regressor to account for the effects of response time. This regressor had a height equal to the response time for each trial, and was orthogonalized with respect to the other four regressors. The six motion correction parameters were also included as additional regressors. Our maps of blood oxygen level dependant (BOLD) signal changes were the result of pairwise contrasts between each of the task conditions. Statistical images were thresholded using clusters determined by Z >2.3 and a corrected cluster size significance threshold of p\u200a=\u200a0.05. \n\n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0007272-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nBrain region\themi\tx\ty\tz\tPeak Z score\nVentromedial prefrontal\tL\t\u22124\t50\t\u221212\t4.42\nSuperior frontal gyrus\tL\t\u221222\t32\t50\t4.06\nLateral occipital cortex\tL\t\u221230\t\u221282\t16\t3.19\n\tR\t44\t\u221288\t12\t3.61\n### Caption\nBelief minus disbelief.\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: pone-0007272-t002\n### Label: Table 2\nBrain region\themi\tx\ty\tz\tPeak Z score\nPostcentral gyrus\tL\t\u221244\t\u221224\t54\t4.41\nSuperior frontal sulcus\tR\t24\t14\t48\t3.36\n### Caption\nDisbelief minus belief.\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: pone-0007272-t003\n### Label: Table 3\nBrain region\themi\tx\ty\tz\tPeak Z score\nPosterior cingulate\t\t\u22122\t\u221222\t30\t6.27\nPrecuneus\tL\t\u221210\t\u221272\t36\t6.38\nAnterior cingulate\t\t0\t30\t26\t5.09\nFrontal pole\tL\t\u221232\t56\t8\t5.3\n\tR\t30\t60\t10\t4.78\nAnterior insula\tL\t\u221236\t10\t\u22124\t4.09\n\tR\t34\t12\t\u22128\t3.59\nMiddle frontal gyrus\tR\t42\t40\t26\t4.14\nLateral occipital gyrus\tL\t\u221232\t\u221262\t48\t5.03\n\tR\t32\t\u221254\t38\t3.93\nIntraparietal sulcus\tL\t\u221232\t\u221256\t40\t5.09\n\tR\t32\t\u221254\t38\t3.93\nVentral striatum\tL\t\u221216\t20\t0\t3.3\n\tL\t\u221214\t12\t\u22126\t3.53\nInferior frontal gyrus\tL\t\u221250\t10\t2\t3.9\nSuperior frontal gyrus\tR\t12\t16\t64\t4.38\nThalamus\t\t2\t\u221224\t6\t3.42\nCerebellum\t\t2\t\u221272\t\u221212\t3.23\n### Caption\nReligious minus nonreligious statements.\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: pone-0007272-t004\n### Label: Table 4\nBrain region\themi\tx\ty\tz\tPeak Z score\nVentromedial prefrontal cortex\tL\t\u22124\t22\t\u221218\t4.1\nSuperior frontal gyrus\tL\t\u221220\t34\t52\t3.54\nMiddle temporal gyrus\tL\t\u221256\t\u22126\t\u221216\t4.52\nParahippocampal gyrus\tL\t\u221226\t\u221240\t\u221214\t5.16\nRetrosplenial cortex\tL\t\u221214\t\u221252\t4\t4.62\nOrbital frontal\tL\t\u221240\t38\t\u221216\t4.35\nTemporal pole\tL\t\u221248\t16\t\u221234\t3.59\nHippocampus\tL\t\u221222\t\u221210\t\u221222\t3.39\n### Caption\nNonreligious minus Religious statements.\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: pone-0007272-t005\n### Label: Table 5\nBrain region\themi\tx\ty\tz\tPeak Z score\nParacingulate gyrus\tR\t2\t40\t34\t3.5\nVentral striatum\tR\t14\t16\t0\t3.52\n\tR\t16\t14\t\u22128\t3.61\nMiddle frontal gyrus\tR\t46\t30\t34\t4.32\n\tL\t\u221248\t36\t22\t3.07\nFrontal pole\tL\t\u221236\t64\t2\t3.77\n\tR\t32\t64\t4\t4.5\nInferior parietal lobe\tL\t\u221242\t\u221248\t46\t3.58\n\tR\t48\t\u221248\t46\t3.39\n### Caption\nDouble subtraction (\u201cblasphemy\u201d contrast).\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: pone-0007272-t006\n### Label: Table 6\nGROUP\tWASI\tEDUCATION\tAGE\nChristians (all):\t125.6\t15.1\t22.0\nNonbelievers (all):\t124.7\t15.1\t21.6\nChristians (male):\t127.6\t15.3\t22.7\nChristian (female):\t123.9\t14.9\t21.4\nNonbelievers (male):\t123.7\t14.6\t21.3\nNonbelievers (female):\t125.5\t15.6\t21.9\n### Caption\nSubject Data: The mean full-scale WASI scores, years of education, and ages for all subjects retained in this experiment.\n### Footer\nNone\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 2748718, "text_md5": "ae603fc2d653bb97a6f68095bc565d81", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 115], "journal": [116, 124], "publication_year": [126, 130], "title": [141, 199], "keywords": [213, 213], "abstract": [226, 2288], "body": [2297, 36545], "tables": [36558, 39006]}, "batch": 3, "pmid": 19794914, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0007272", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748718", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=2748718"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748718\">2748718</a>", "list_title": "PMC2748718  The Neural Correlates of Religious and Nonreligious Belief"}

Disruptions in cortico-cortical connectivity have been suggested as a primary mechanism of unconsciousness. By using a novel combination of positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we studied anesthesia-induced unconsciousness and recovery using the \u03b1 -agonist dexmedetomidine. During unconsciousness, cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and cerebral blood flow were preferentially decreased in the thalamus, the Default Mode Network (DMN), and the bilateral Frontoparietal Networks (FPNs). Cortico-cortical functional connectivity within the DMN and FPNs was preserved. However, DMN thalamo-cortical functional connectivity was disrupted. Recovery from this state was associated with sustained reduction in cerebral blood flow and restored DMN thalamo-cortical functional connectivity. We report that loss of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is sufficient to produce unconsciousness. \n\n DOI:  \n   eLife digest  \nAlthough we are all familiar with the experience of being conscious, explaining precisely what consciousness is and how it arises from activity in the brain remains extremely challenging. Indeed, explaining consciousness is so challenging that it is sometimes referred to as \u2018the hard question\u2019 of neuroscience. \n\nOne way to obtain insights into the neural basis of consciousness is to compare patterns of activity in the brains of conscious subjects with patterns of brain activity in the same subjects under anesthesia. The results of some experiments of this kind suggest that loss of consciousness occurs when the communication between specific regions within the outer layer of the brain, the cortex, is disrupted. However, other studies seem to contradict these findings by showing that this communication can sometimes remain intact in unconscious subjects. \n\nAkeju, Loggia et al. have now resolved this issue by using brain imaging to examine the changes that occur as healthy volunteers enter and emerge from a light form of anesthesia roughly equivalent to non-REM sleep. An imaging technique called PET revealed that the loss of consciousness in the subjects was accompanied by reduced activity in a structure deep within the brain called the thalamus. Reduced activity was also seen in areas of cortex at the front and back of the brain. \n\nA technique called fMRI showed in turn that communication between the cortex and the thalamus was disrupted as subjects drifted into unconsciousness, whereas communication between cortical regions was spared. As subjects awakened from the anesthesia, communication between the thalamus and the cortex was restored. \n\nThese results suggest that changes within distinct brain regions give rise to different depths of unconsciousness. Loss of communication between the thalamus and the cortex generates the unconsciousness of sleep or light anesthesia, while the additional loss of communication between cortical regions generates the unconsciousness of general anesthesia or coma. In addition to explaining the mixed results seen in previous experiments, this distinction could lead to advances in the diagnosis of patients with disorders of consciousness, and even to the development of therapies that target the thalamus and its connections with cortex. \n\n DOI:  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nUnderstanding the neural mechanisms of consciousness is a fundamental challenge of current neuroscience research. We note that precise definitions of the words \u2018consciousness\u2019 and \u2018unconsciousness\u2019 remain ambiguous. However, loss of voluntary response in a task is an effective and clinically relevant definition of unconsciousness. Over the past decade, important insights have been gained by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize the brain during sleep, and disorders of consciousness (DOC) such as coma, vegetative states, and minimally conscious states ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In addition to being critical for patients to safely and humanely undergo traumatic surgical or diagnostic procedures, anesthesia has long been recognized as a tool for studying the neural mechanisms of loss and recovery of consciousness ( ). \n\nDisruption of cortico-cortical connectivity has been proposed as a central mechanism to explain unconsciousness associated with general anesthesia, sleep, and DOC ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, recent evidence suggests that cortico-cortical functional connectivity may be maintained during unconsciousness ( ;  ;  ). To develop more precise neuroanatomic and neurophysiological characterizations of this and other putative mechanisms, studies of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness could benefit from the use of multimodal imaging approaches, combined with neurophysiological understanding of the brain state induced by the anesthetic drug being studied. \n\nA challenge in using anesthetics to study unconsciousness is stating precise, possible mechanisms of anesthetic-induced brain states, and using an anesthetic which acts at single rather than multiple brain targets to test those mechanism ( ;  ;  ). Among the several anesthetics in current use today, dexmedetomidine is an appealing choice for testing a specific mechanism of how an anesthetic alters the level of consciousness. Dexmedetomidine selectively targets pre-synaptic \u03b1 -adrenergic receptors on neurons projecting from the locus ceruleus to the pre-optic area ( ;  ;  ). This leads to activation of inhibitory outputs to the major arousal centers in the midbrain, pons, and hypothalamus producing a neurophysiological and behavioral state that closely resembles NREM II sleep ( ) ( ;  ;  ). Dexmedetomidine also acts at the locus ceruleus projections to the intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus, the basal forebrain and the cortex ( ).    Schematic of dexmedetomidine signaling illustrating similarities to the mechanism proposed for the generation of non-rapid eye movement II sleep.  \nDexmedetomidine binds to \u03b12 receptors on neurons emanating from the locus ceruleus to inhibit NE release in the POA. The disinhibited POA reduces arousal by means of GABA- and galanin-mediated inhibition of the midbrain, hypothalamic, and pontine arousal nuclei. Dexmedetomidine also acts at the locus ceruleus projections to the intralaminar nucleus of the hypothalamus, the basal forebrain and the cortex and on post-synaptic \u03b12 receptors. 5HT, serotonin; Ach, acetylcholine; BF, basal forebrain; DA, dopamine; Dex; dexmedetomidine; DR, dorsal raphe; GABA, gamma aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A; Gal, galanin; His, histamine; LC, locus ceruleus; LDT, laterodorsal tegmental area; NE, norepinephrine; PAG, periaqueductal gray; POA, preoptic area; PPT, pedunculopontine tegmental area; TMN, tuberomamillary nucleus. \n\n DOI:  \n  \n\nTherefore, the aim of this study was to use a novel integrated positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MR) approach to characterize brain resting-state network activity and metabolism during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. This strategy offers several appealing features. First, PET scanning using fludeoxyglucose ( F-FDG) provides a sensitive estimate of the brain's metabolic state in terms of the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMR ). Second, comparison of CMR  results with regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) estimates obtained from pulsed Arterial Spin Labeling (pASL) fMRI signals allows a direct assessment of whether, as previously reported, flow-metabolism coupling is maintained during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness ( ). Third, we use the CMR  results to inform the brain functional connectivity analysis derived from the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Decreased CMRglc in the Default Mode Network (DMN), Fronto Parietal Networks (FPNs), and thalamus during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness \n  \nIn 10 healthy volunteers, we used EEG recordings, and an auditory task to confirm that dexmedetomidine induced a loss of voluntary responsiveness, and exhibited a neurophysiological profile that was similar to non rapid eye movement (NREM) II sleep ( ). We then studied  F-FDG uptake during baseline and dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness in these 10 healthy volunteers in a separate experiment where we defined loss of consciousness as the onset of sustained eye closure and lack of response to a verbal request to open the eyes ( ). During both the baseline and dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness  F-FDG study visits (two per subject), fMRI data were also recorded. Consistent with a global decrease in glucose metabolism, we found that during the unconscious state, there was a broad reduction in  F-FDG standardized uptake values in the brain ( ). To quantify this result, we calculated CMR  during the two  F-FDG visits ( ). We found reduced CMR  in thalamic, frontal, and parietal brain regions during the unconscious state ( ,  ). The difference in CMR  exhibited a spatial distribution consistent with the previously described DMN ( ;  ) and both left and right FPNs ( ) ( ;  ). We found these network-specific CMR  changes interesting because the DMN has been linked to stimulus-independent thought and self-consciousness ( ;  ;  ), while the FPNs have been linked to conscious perception of the external environment and executive control initiation ( ;  ).    CMR  and rCBF are decreased in both the default mode and the frontal\u2013parietal network brain regions during unconsciousness.  \n(  A  ) Study outline of healthy volunteers recruited to undergo both baseline and dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness PET brain imaging in a random order.

Analysis of the rCBF difference maps between the unconscious and baseline states showed decreases in rCBF during unconsciousness that overlapped with the same DMN and FPN regions that demonstrated reductions in CMR  ( ,  ,  ). This is consistent with maintenance of blood flow and metabolism coupling during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness.   \nrCBF, awake vs unconscious \n\n DOI:  \n    \n\n\n### Decreased thalamo-cortical and cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness \n  \nGiven that we observed reduced flow and metabolism in regions known to correspond to the DMN and FPNs ( ;  ;  ), we next asked whether intrinsic functional connectivity within these networks was altered with dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. First, we confirmed that during both wakefulness and unconsciousness, the DMN and bilateral FPNs were consistently identified in our volunteers ( ,  ). Next, we performed a comparison of changes in these networks between the unconscious and awake states. When we compared the DMN between these two states, we found no difference in functional connectivity between the cortical regions of the DMN and FPNs, suggesting that cortico\u2013cortico functional connectivity may be maintained during unconsciousness ( ,  ). However, we observed a reduction in functional connectivity between the thalamus and the DMN in the unconscious state ( ,  ). This loss of thalamic functional connectivity was observed in a region consistent with intralaminar, midline, mediodorsal, and ventral anterior nuclei. However, our ability to precisely resolve the thalamic nuclei implicated in loss of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is limited because our methods are not sensitive to small focal differences. We also found that functional connectivity of the left cerebellar representation of the DMN ( ) was significantly reduced during unconsciousness ( ,  ). When we compared the FPNs in these two states, we found that the left and right FPNs showed opposite changes in functional connectivity with a cerebellar cluster, likely indicating a switch in hemispheric dominance for cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity to this region during unconsciousness ( ,  ,  ). Functional connectivity of the cerebellar representations of the FPNs ( ) was also significantly reduced ( ,  ,  ). Since cortico-cerebellar connections are mediated by the thalamus ( ), the changes we observed in cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity are likely related to impaired thalamic functioning. Taken together, these results show that unconsciousness is associated with decreased thalamic CMR , rCBF, and functional connectivity to the DMN and support the notion that the thalamus plays a critical role in mediating unconsciousness.

This thalamic seed also overlapped with thalamic regions showing reduced rCBF and CMR . Our seed-based analysis allowed us to more thoroughly examine changes in thalamic functional connectivity to all brain regions. We found that the thalamic seed was significantly functionally disconnected from posterior regions of the DMN (posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobules) during unconsciousness ( ,  ). Notably, the cortical regions showing reduced thalamic functional connectivity also overlapped with those demonstrating reduced flow and metabolism ( ).

We identified 10 volunteers who responded to verbal instructions (opened eyes and gave a thumbs-up signal, though they were still mildly sedated) during at least 6 min of the recovery ASL scan. Surprisingly, when we compared the recovery state to the unconscious state in these volunteers, we found that the rCBF did not increase (cluster corrected,  ). In fact, when explored at a more liberal threshold (uncorrected, p < 0.05), further decreases in rCBF were observed ( ). When we compared the recovery state to the awake state, we found that the decrease in rCBF showed a spatial distribution similar to that observed during the unconscious state ( ). Next, we aligned all subjects to unconscious and recovery time points in order to study the dynamics of rCBF changes within the statistically significant clusters. We confirmed that rCBF decreased during loss of consciousness and that this decrease was maintained during recovery from this state in all regions analyzed ( ). These results suggest that cortical rCBF increase was not sufficient for the early stages of recovery from unconsciousness induced by dexmedetomidine.    Cortical increase in rCBF is not evident during the recovery of consciousness.  \n(  A  ) Cluster corrected (n = 10) rCBF comparison of the recovery state vs the unconsciousness state displayed on the MNI152 standard volume highlighting no change in rCBF at recovery.

We also found that the opposing left and right FPN changes in the cerebellar cluster ( ) were also reversed ( ,  ). When we analyzed the functional connectivity of our thalamic seed of interest, we found that thalamic functional connectivity to the posterior cingulate cortex and thalamo-thalamic functional connectivity were restored during the recovery state ( ,  ). Taken together, these results provide further evidence that dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness is associated with decreased thalamic functional connectivity to the DMN and supports the notion that the thalamus plays a critical role in mediating unconsciousness and recovery from this state.

By using a very site-specific drug, performing for the first time simultaneous measurements of CMR , rCBF, resting state BOLD low frequency oscillations, and analyzing both dexmedetomidine-induced loss of consciousness and recovery, we have been able to identify a minimal disruption of neural networks that is shared between altered consciousness states. Our results show that during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness, cortico-cortical functional connectivity remains intact but thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is disrupted. This disrupted thalamo-cortical functional connectivity appropriately reverses during recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. \n\n### Thalamo-cortical correlates of altered arousal and unconsciousness \n  \nThe notion that disruption of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity could constitute a neural-network mechanism responsible for unconsciousness that is distinct from disruption of cortico-cortical functional connectivity is supported by a number of findings. During, NREM I and II sleep in humans, DMN cortico-cortical functional connectivity remains preserved ( ;  ) while thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is disrupted ( ). However, during NREM III, there is a functional disconnection between frontal and parietal nodes of the DMN ( ;  ), and disrupted thalamo-cortical functional connectivity ( ). Likewise, in-depth electrode studies in humans show that changes in thalamic activity during sleep precedes changes in cortical activity, suggesting that disrupted thalamo-cortical functional connectivity may underlie changes in consciousness ( ). Also, during propofol anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, decreases in thalamo-cortical functional connectivity, alongside disruptions in cortico-cortical functional connectivity in the DMN and FPNs, have been described in healthy volunteers ( ;  ) Functional reintegration of the thalamus to key regions of the cortex appears to be necessary for the recovery of consciousness from this state ( ). \n\n\n### A putative functional network for recovery from unconsciousness comprising the locus ceruleus, central thalamus, and posterior cingulate cortex \n  \nNorepinephrinergic neurons in the locus ceruleus project to thalamic mediodorsal, midline, intralaminar nuclei, which in turn have neurons that project to the cingulate cortex ( ;  ;  ;  ). Our results show that these connections may comprise a functional circuit that is disrupted during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. Moreover, this functional circuit appears specifically to involve the posterior cingulate cortex, distinct from anterior or mid-cingulate cortex. In our thalamic seed-based functional connectivity analysis, we found that during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness, thalamic regions consistent with intralaminar, midline, mediodorsal, and ventral anterior nuclei were functionally disconnected from posterior DMN structures (precuneus and the posterior cingulate cortex). Perhaps more importantly, recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness was associated with restored thalamo-thalamic and thalamic functional connectivity to the posterior cingulate cortex. Structural connectivity between the thalamus and the posterior cingulate cortex has also recently been correlated with the severity of DOC and used to subcategorize patients in minimally conscious states ( ). The above observations lead us to conclude that a noradrenergic circuit involving the thalamus and posterior cingulate cortex may be important for recovery from both dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness and DOC states. \n\n\n### Reduced cerebral blood flow during recovery of consciousness \n  \nAn FDG-PET study has recently described a linear relationship between metabolism in the precuneus and central thalamus in severely brain-injured patients with DOC ( ). We note that our observed reduction in blood flow in the precuneus and thalamus during dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness parallels this result. However, during recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness, we did not observe an increase in rCBF to any brain regions. Since our current and previously reported ( ) results suggest that dexmedetomidine does not decouple rCBF and CMRglc, we surmise that metabolism does not return to baseline during the earliest phases of recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. Thus, the reduced rCBF we report after recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness could reflect a residual drug effect state in which subjects are responsive to external stimuli but remain in a sedated state. This residual effect may be mediated by the broad and diffuse nor-adrenergic projections from the locus ceruleus to the rest of the brain ( ). \n\nThis result is interesting because it suggests that recovery from unconsciousness may occur in a graded fashion. For example, performance on more complex cognitive tasks likely differs substantially between the awake and recovery states. This suggests that re-establishment of functional connectivity between vital brain regions precedes increases in rCBF and CMRglc. Return of rCBF and CMRglc to baseline levels may be indicative of the final stages of recovery from dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. Future investigations incorporating cognitive and psychomotor vigilance tasks during recovery from experimental models of unconsciousness would lend further insight on whether this is a drug-specific effect. Nevertheless, this finding is interesting because it suggests that recovery from unconsciousness states may proceed prior to significant increases in rCBF. \n\n\n### Different states of unconsciousness may reflect a hierarchy of disruption in functional circuits \n  \nDrawing from previous work on sleep ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and anesthesia ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), our results suggest a hierarchy of brain network disruptions that can result in different states of altered consciousness. In NREM II (non-slow wave) sleep and dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness, patients can be easily aroused to respond to verbal commands by sufficiently strong external stimuli. In these states, cortico-cortical functional connectivity is preserved ( ;  ), but thalamo-cortical functional connectivity is disrupted ( ). In propofol anesthesia-induced unconsciousness and some DOC states, where patients cannot be aroused by external stimuli, both cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity are disrupted ( ). \n\nIn the case of sleep, dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness, and some minimally conscious states, maintained cortico-cortical functional connectivity likely allows for the cortex to be \u2018primed\u2019, ready to recover from the altered consciousness states with restoration of thalamic functional connectivity, which could be triggered by ascending midbrain and brainstem inputs ( ) or direct therapeutic intervention at the thalamic level ( ;  ). In other altered consciousness states, such as during general anesthesia or comatose states, markedly disrupted cortico-cortical functional connectivity could further impair the ability to recover consciousness. We note that while it might be theoretically possible to attain unconsciousness by disrupting only cortico-cortical functional connectivity while preserving thalamo-cortical functional connectivity, it appears, from our study and others, that this does not happen during sleep and anesthesia-induced unconsciousness. \n\nCompared to the findings supporting a role for disrupted cortico-cortical functional connectivity during unconsciousness, our findings suggest that thalamo-cortical connectivity constitutes a more fundamental disruption required to produce unconsciousness. This insight could lead to a more objective characterization, diagnosis, and prognosis of DOC. Also, the state of cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity could be used to better select patients who may benefit from therapeutic interventions. For instance, in the event of maintained cortico-cortical functional connectivity but impaired thalamo-cortical functional connectivity with intact thalamo-cortical structural connections ( ), therapies aimed at restoring thalamo-cortical functional connectivity might be more likely to help patients recover. These therapies could be pharmacological ( ), electrical ( ), or could involve other forms of stimulation. Since dexmedetomidine appears to disrupt functional network activity in a manner similar to NREM II sleep, our results also suggest that alpha-2-receptor agonists could be further developed as effective sleep therapeutic drugs. \n\n\n### Subjective awareness during sleep and anesthesia \n  \nAt present, there is a debate pertaining to whether anesthetized and unresponsive patients (without motor impairments) can remain internally conscious to subjective experiences (internally generated or provoked by external stimuli). This debate has been fueled by clinical studies of anesthetized patients that have reported rare intraoperative episodes of awareness (resulting from light anesthetic depth) under anesthesia ( ) and dreaming under anesthesia ( ;  ;  ;  ). Noreika et al. studied this phenomenon with dexmedetomidine, sevoflurane, propofol, and xenon ( ) and confirmed that subjective experiences of consciousness occur during clinically defined unconsciousness states. However, the experimental paradigm that was used to test for subjective experiences of consciousness involved a gradual increase in drug concentrations. This empiric gradual increase did not directly target anesthetic drug dosing to a neurophysiologically defined brain state nor does it inform us on the amount of time that was spent in lighter levels of anesthesia. Thus, the reported subjective experiences could have occurred when the drug concentration levels were very low. This line of reasoning is supported by evidence confirming that subjective experiences of dreaming under general anesthesia likely occur when patients are emerging from general anesthesia ( ). \n\nSubjective experiences of consciousness also occur during REM sleep ( ). To a limited degree, they are also thought to occur during NREM sleep, especially at sleep onset in NREM I and during NREM II sleep periods encountered later at night ( ). However, the current methods for scoring sleep states remain imprecise and highly subjective, with limited state and temporal resolution, and high intra- and inter-scorer variability, raising the possibility that clinically scored NREM I and II sleep may include periods of arousal. In clinical sleep scoring, trained technicians visually score the sleep time-series data in 30-s epochs according to semantically defined sleep stages. These scoring standards grossly simplify sleep electroencephalographic dynamics. For example, consider the characterization of sleep onset. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine defines sleep onset as the first appearance of any 30-s epoch that contains at least 15 s of sleep ( ). This implies that sleep onset is a binary process. However, recent EEG studies in humans clearly demonstrate that sleep onset, at both a neurophysiological and behavioral level, is a continuous process. As such, methods designed to track moment-to-moment continuous variations in the EEG are significantly better at predicting when subjects lose wakefulness, measured in terms of a behavioral task, than traditional sleep scoring methods ( ). In particular, subjects can continue to perform awake behavior despite being scored as asleep (NREM I) using traditional sleep scoring methods. Thus, it is possible that the subjective experiences of consciousness that have been ascribed to NREM sleep could have occurred during subjectively scored sleep stages that included un-scored periods of arousal or wakefulness. \n\nDespite this rapidly evolving understanding of subjective experiences during altered arousal under sleep and anesthesia, we have tried in this study to focus on a particular state of dexmedetomidine-induced unconsciousness. We achieved this state through rapid administration of dexmedetomidine and confirmed that this dose and form of drug administration produces a NREM II-like state ( ). We then applied a combination of fMRI and FDG-PET imaging that would characterize the overall time-integrated brain activity during this state. Clinical evidence shows that motor-evoked potentials, and thus motor function from cortex down, remain intact in this state, making it unlikely that the loss of responsiveness we observed is only a result of disrupted motor function ( ;  ). Therefore, we feel it is appropriate to refer to the state of altered arousal described in this manuscript as dexmedetomdine-induced unconsciousness. \n\nA long-standing debate in anesthesiology relates to the fundamental systems-level mechanisms for anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, with some investigators proposing a thalamic switch ( ) and others proposing disrupted cortico-cortical connections as the central mechanism ( ;  ;  ). Our results, in combination with previous work, resolve this conflict by showing how both mechanisms could co-exist but at different parts of the continuum of altered arousal or unconsciousness. Moreover, it suggests a mechanistic interpretation for varying levels of anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, where disrupted thalamo-cortical functional connectivity, but intact cortico-cortical functional connectivity reflects lighter states of unconsciousness and disruptions of both cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity reflect deeper states of unconsciousness. These insights could guide development of system-specific anesthetic drugs that possess minimal side effects and improved monitoring of patients in both the operating room and intensive care settings. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subject selection \n  \nThis study was conducted at the Athinoula A Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at the Massachusetts General Hospital. The Human Research Committee and the Radioactive Drug Research Committee at the Massachusetts General Hospital approved the study protocol. After an initial email/phone screen, potential study subjects were invited to participate in a screening visit. At the screening visit, informed consent including the consent to publish was requested after the nature and possible consequences of the study was explained. All subjects provided informed consent and were American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status I with Mallampati Class I airway anatomy. After providing informed consent, a standard pre-anesthesia assessment was administered and a blood toxicology screen was performed to ensure that subjects were not taking drugs that might confound the interpretation of study results. A complete metabolic panel and a urine pregnancy test were also obtained to confirm that all values were within normal ranges and to confirm non-pregnant status, respectively. A total of 20 subjects participated in screening visits and 18 subjects were deemed eligible to participate in the study protocol. Two subjects were deemed ineligible after medical evaluation and one subject was lost to follow-up after providing informed consent. During all study visits, subjects were required to take nothing by mouth for at least 8 hr. A urine toxicology screen was performed to ensure that subjects had not taken drugs that might confound interpretation of the results. A pregnancy test was also administered (serum for PET visits, urine for fMRI only visits) for each female subject to confirm non-pregnant status. \n\n\n### Imaging visit \n  \nWe studied awake, unconscious, and recovery states in humans, using an integrated positron PET/MR approach, in healthy volunteers, 18\u201336 years of age. Brain imaging was performed with the Biograph mMR scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), which allows simultaneous acquisition of whole-body PET and 3 Tesla MRI data. The fully integrated PET detectors use avalanche photoiodide technology and lutetium oxyorthosilicate crystals (8 \u00d7 8 arrays of 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 20 mm  crystals). The PET scanner's transaxial and axial fields of view are 594 mm and 25.8 cm, respectively ( ). Approximately, 5 mCi of FDG was purchased from an outside approved vendor and was administered as a bolus immediately before the initiation of the dexmedetomidine (described below). A PET-compatible 16-channel head and neck array was used to acquire the MR data. \n\nAt the beginning of the imaging visit, we acquired structural MRI (MPRAGE volume, TR/TE = 2100/3.24 ms, flip angle = 7\u00b0, voxel size = 1 mm isotropic) for the purpose of anatomical localization, spatial normalization, and surface visualization of the imaging data. A 6:08 min pASL scan and a 6:15 min BOLD fMRI scans were performed (\u2018awake\u2019 pASL and BOLD scans;  ), in order to assess rCBF and functional connectivity at baseline. The pASL scans were collected using the \u2018PICORE-Q2TIPS\u2019 MRI labeling method ( ) (TR/TE/TI1/TI2 = 3000/13/700/1700 ms, voxel size = 3.5*3.5*5 mm, number of slices = 16). \u2018Tag\u2019 images were acquired by labeling a thick inversion slab (110 mm), proximal to the imaging slices (gap = 21.1 mm). \u2018Control\u2019 images were acquired interleaved with the tag images, by applying an off-resonance inversion pulse without any spatial encoding gradient. At the beginning of each pASL scan, an M  scan (i.e., the longitudinal magnetization of fully relaxed tissue) was acquired for rCBF quantification purposes. The pASL imaging volume common to all subjects scanned covered most of the cerebrum, and extended ventrally to the midbrain and dorsally to the vertex ( ). BOLD fMRI data were collected using a whole brain T2*-weighted gradient echo BOLD echo planar imaging pulse sequence was used (TR/TE = 3000/35 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, voxel size = 2.3 \u00d7 2.3 \u00d7 3.8 mm, number of slices = 35). \n\nAfter the awake scans, dexmedetomidine was administered as a 1 mcg/kg loading bolus over 10 min, followed by a 0.7 mcg/kg/hr infusion to maintain unconsciousness. Another pASL scan was initiated at the onset of the dexmedetomidine infusion, with identical imaging parameters as the awake pASL scan, except for a longer duration (20:08 min). This longer acquisition was performed in order to ensure that perfusion data were collected for a long enough period to capture the transition from the awake to the unconscious state. During the infusion period, the study anesthesiologists monitored cuff blood pressure, capnography, electrocardiogram, and pulse-oximetry. Volunteers were instructed to keep their eyes open during the course of the study; loss of consciousness was defined as the onset of sustained eye closure and lack of response to a verbal request to open the eyes. After the onset of unconsciousness, we then performed a 6:15 min \u2018unconscious\u2019 BOLD fMRI scan (to evaluate unconsciousness-related changes in functional connectivity). After acquisition of all images, the dexmedetomidine infusion was discontinued, and a 20:08 min pASL scan was performed to assess changes in rCBF upon recovery. Spontaneous eye opening and a positive response to give a thumbs-up signal were used to determine recovery of consciousness. All 10 subjects who experienced spontaneous eye opening during the final 6:08 min of the recovery of consciousness pASL successfully executed on the thumbs-up signal request. An additional 6:15 min \u2018recovery\u2019 BOLD fMRI scan was performed, in order to assess variations in functional connectivity upon recovery. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nPET data collected from 10 subjects (two visits each) and stored in list mode format were binned into sinograms. In addition to the static frame corresponding to 40\u201360 min post FDG administration, dynamic frames of progressively longer duration were generated for quantitative analysis. PET images were reconstructed using an ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithm, with 3 iterations and 21 subsets. Corrections were applied to account for variable detector efficiencies and dead time, photon attenuation and scatter and radioactive decay using the software provided by the manufacturer. We employed a method that is similar to the generation of attenuation maps for computed tomography data to generate our head attenuation maps from the MPRAGE data. This head attenuation map was combined with the hardware (i.e., RF coil, patient table, etc) attenuation map provided by the manufacturer. Spatial smoothing was performed post-reconstruction using a 4 mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. \n\nStandardized uptake values (SUV; i.e., mean radioactivity/injected dose/weight) were computed voxelwise from the emission data collected 40\u201360 min post-injection. In order to quantitatively assess metabolic changes, cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) were computed from the dynamic PET frames with the non-invasive method proposed by  , using the whole-brain as our reference region. SUV and CMRglc maps were then coregistered with the high resolution MRI scan using BBREGISTER tool ( ) from the FreeSurfer suite ( ), normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using nonlinear registration (FNIRT, from the FSL suite; FMRIB's Software Library,  ) ( ) and then smoothed with an 8 mm FWHM kernel. A paired, whole-brain, voxel wise, mixed effects analysis was conducted to compare SUV and CMRglc across visits (n = 10). Statistical parametric maps were thresholded using clusters determined by a voxel-wise threshold (Z > 2.3) and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of p = 0.05 ( ). \n\nfMRI data were collected from 17 subjects. However, BOLD data (awake, unconscious, and recovery) were successfully collected in only 15 subjects. This is because BOLD data was collected with a different set of parameters in one subject and another subject exited the scanner immediately prior to the recovery BOLD scan. ASL data preprocessing was performed using a combination of analysis packages including FSL, and Freesurfer. The \u2018tag\u2019, \u2018control\u2019, and M  scans were first motion-corrected using MCFLIRT ( ). Then, tag and control scans were surround subtracted (i.e., given each tag , [(control  + control  )/2 \u2212 tag ]) to achieve perfusion-weighted images. Quantification of rCBF was performed using the ASLtbx toolbox ( ;  ) from the following data: the whole 6 min awake scan, the last 6 min of the 20 min induction of unconsciousness scan (i.e., the portion of the scan during which all subjects were unconscious; \u2018unconscious\u2019 scan) and the last 6 min of the 20-min recovery of consciousness scan (i.e., the portion of the scan during which 10 subjects had recovered; \u2018recovery\u2019 scan). \n\nrCBF maps were coregistered with the high resolution MR scan using Freesurfer's BBREGISTER tool ( ), normalized to MNI space using nonlinear registration (FNIRT) ( ) and then smoothed with a 7 mm FWHM kernel. A paired, voxel wise, mixed effects analyses were conducted to compare rCBF between the awake and unconscious states data (n = 17). This contrast was computed only within voxels imaged in all subjects (see   for coverage common to all subjects), as assessed through the computation of a conjunction mask from all the MNI-registered M  scans. Given that rCBF estimation in the white matter presents methodological challenges (particularly given the poor signal-to-noise ratio and longer arterial transit time) ( ), voxels classified as white matter in (the arbitrary value of) \u2265 70% of subjects by the Harvard\u2013Oxford Subcortical Structural Atlas (Center for Morphometric Analyses,  ) were excluded from the analyses. \n\nSubsequently, another paired analysis was performed to compare rCBF between the unconscious and recovery states. In this analysis, only the 10 subjects who were awake for the full duration of the last 6 min of the 20-min recovery scans were included. This analysis was focused within search areas determined by the statistically significant clusters in the \u2018unconscious vs awake\u2019 contrast. Unless otherwise specified, all rCBF statistical parametric maps were thresholded using clusters determined by a voxel-wise threshold (Z > 2.3) and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of p = 0.05 ( ). \n\nResting-state BOLD fMRI data were used to perform functional connectivity analyses. Datasets were slice-timing corrected (SLICETIMER), motion-corrected (MCFLIRT), brain-extracted (BET), registered to MPRAGE (BBREGISTER) and then to the MNI152 atlas (FNIRT), smoothed with a 5 mm FMWH kernel and high-pass filtered (cutoff = 0.008 Hz). As ASL and PET analyses revealed that unconsciousness was associated with a reduction in glucose metabolism and rCBF in regions belonging to distinct resting-state networks (Default Mode and both Frontoparietal Control networks; DMN, FCN), we assessed how intrinsic functional connectivity of these specific networks was affected by unconsciousness, using the dual regression approach ( ;  ). All the preprocessed datasets were concatenated to create a single 4D dataset. A probabilistic Independent Component Analysis (pICA) ( ) was performed using Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components (MELODIC) on this concatenated 4D dataset, limiting the number of independent components (ICs) to 25, as in previous publications using the dual regression approach ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ). From the pool of the 25 ICs, the DMN, right and left FCNs were clearly identified. Group-level spatial maps for each of these RSNs were used as a set of spatial regressors in a General Linear Model (GLM), in order to identify the individual subjects' time course associated with each group-level map. These time courses were then variance normalized and used as a set of temporal regressors in a GLM, to find subject-specific maps associated with the different group-level independent components. In this GLM, explanatory variables also included six motion parameters and the time courses from ventricles and white matter as covariates of no interest. Subject-specific maps were compared across states (awake, unconscious, recovery) using paired t-tests. As our dual regression ICA approach identified altered DMN functional connectivity to the thalamus, we used this thalamic region as a seed for seed-based functional connectivity analysis. This follow-up analysis was done with the purpose of (1) determining whether specific portions of the DMN (e.g., more posterior regions within the network) may be responsible for driving the effect and (2) assessing changes in functional connectivity between the thalamus and other, non-DMN regions. The extracted fMRI time series, variance normalized, was used as a regressor in a GLM for the awake, unconscious, and recovery data. The same nuisance regressors adopted in the dual regression analyses (see above), with the addition of global signal time course were used in the seed-based analyses. Statistical parametric maps were thresholded using clusters determined by a voxel-wise threshold (Z > 2.3) and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of p = 0.05 ( ). From representative clusters identified in the various analyses, data were extracted and displayed for illustrative purposes. Human brain atlases were used for anatomical reference of the cerebrum ( ) and the cerebellum ( ). \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: tbl1\n### Label: Table 1.\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tUnnamed: 1_level_0\tMNI coordinate (mm)\tMNI coordinate (mm)\tMNI coordinate (mm)\tUnnamed: 5_level_0\tUnnamed: 6_level_0\nLabel\tZ-stat\tx\ty\tz\tcluster size (# voxels)\tcluster p-value\nawake > dex-induced unconsciousness\tawake > dex-induced unconsciousness\tawake > dex-induced unconsciousness\tawake > dex-induced unconsciousness\tawake > dex-induced unconsciousness\tawake > dex-induced unconsciousness\tawake > dex-induced unconsciousness\nR middle/inferior frontal gyrus\t4.35\t52\t42\t4\t17919\t2.95E-12\nR medial orbital gyrus\t4.22\t24\t38\t\u221216\t17919\t2.95E-12\nL inferior frontal gyrus\t4.02\t\u221252\t36\t10\t17919\t2.95E-12\nL superior frontal gyrus, medial part\t4\t\u22126\t20\t40\t17919\t2.95E-12\nL middle frontal gyrus\t3.94\t\u221242\t18\t38\t17919\t2.95E-12\nL middle frontal gyrus\t3.86\t\u221234\t8\t66\t17919\t2.95E-12\nR middle frontopolar gyrus\t3.79\t\u221230\t58\t2\t17919\t2.95E-12\nL lateral orbital gyrus\t3.58\t\u221246\t28\t\u221212\t17919\t2.95E-12\nL medial orbital gyrus\t3.56\t\u221226\t32\t\u221222\t17919\t2.95E-12\nR middle frontal gyrus\t3.55\t48\t20\t44\t17919\t2.95E-12\nR superior frontal gyrus\t3.48\t26\t2\t56\t17919\t2.95E-12\nR inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis\t3.37\t54\t16\t4\t17919\t2.95E-12\nL inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis\t3.36\t\u221246\t20\t0\t17919\t2.95E-12\nL superior frontal gyrus, medial part (2)\t3.33\t\u22124\t42\t22\t17919\t2.95E-12\ninferior rostral gyrus\t3.15\t0\t48\t\u221210\t17919\t2.95E-12\nR anterior insula\t2.82\t40\t22\t0\t17919\t2.95E-12\nL Posterior Cingulate Gyrus\t5.56\t\u22124\t\u221224\t38\t5443\t2.85E-05\nL precuneus\t4.27\t\u221212\t\u221264\t22\t5443\t2.85E-05\nR precuneus\t3.86\t12\t\u221260\t28\t5443\t2.85E-05\nL supramarginal gyrus\t4.58\t\u221240\t\u221246\t42\t2861\t0.0029\nL angular gyrus\t3.76\t\u221248\t\u221268\t34\t2861\t0.0029\nR supramarginal gyrus\t4.59\t44\t\u221246\t48\t2214\t0.0112\nR angular gyrus\t4\t34\t\u221262\t44\t2214\t0.0112\nR thalamus\t4.52\t12\t\u221220\t4\t1610\t0.0444\nL thalamus\t3.89\t\u221214\t\u221226\t4\t1610\t0.0444\n### Caption\nCMRglc, awake vs dex-induced unconsciousnessDOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04499.006\n### Footer\nCMRglc, cerebral metabolic rate of glucose;

One striking example is the ease with which they adapt to novel speech distortions such as listening to someone with a foreign accent. Behavioural studies suggest that significant improvements in comprehension occur rapidly \u2014 often within 10\u201320 sentences. In the present experiment, we investigate the neural changes underlying on-line adaptation to distorted speech using time-compressed speech. Listeners performed a sentence verification task on normal-speed and time-compressed sentences while their neural responses were recorded using fMRI. The results showed that rapid learning of the time-compressed speech occurred during presentation of the first block of 16 sentences and was associated with increased activation in left and right auditory association cortices and in left ventral premotor cortex. These findings suggest that the ability to adapt to a distorted speech signal may, in part, rely on mapping novel acoustic patterns onto existing articulatory motor plans, consistent with the idea that speech perception involves integrating multi-modal information including auditory and motoric cues. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nWhen meeting someone with a heavy foreign or regional accent, listeners may find themselves struggling to understand them at first, but comprehension becomes easier within a few minutes. After interacting even longer, one may not even be aware of the speaker's accent anymore. This situation illustrates a remarkable faculty of the speech comprehension system: the ability to quickly adapt to the acoustic consequences of a wide variation in sources when perceiving speech. Listeners have been found to adapt to foreign-accented speech ( ), noise-vocoded speech ( ), spectrally shifted speech ( ), synthetic speech ( ), and time-compressed speech ( ) to name a few. This ability to adapt to distortions of the speech signal in general, has been studied extensively using time-compressed speech, which is a method for artificially shortening the duration of an audio signal without affecting the fundamental frequency of that signal ( ). Listeners are quickly able to adapt to sentences compressed up to 35% of their original duration, within 10\u201320 sentences ( ). Even though the distortion of the acoustic signal associated with time-compressing speech differs from, for instance, variations caused by speaking with a foreign accent, time-compressed speech has been used to study adaptation processes, as it is easy to create speech samples at a wide variety of compression rates. Furthermore, it allows for using the same speaker in time-compressed and uncompressed conditions, which is often not possible using foreign-accented speech. \n\nBehaviourally, perceptual adaptation to distorted speech has often been described as an attention-weighing process in which listeners shift their attention from task-irrelevant to task-relevant cues ( ). More specifically, it has been argued that learning of time-compressed speech is characterised by the recalibration of the boundaries between speech sounds to accommodate the faster speech rate ( ). In other words, the adaptation is believed to occur primarily at an auditory level using increased attentional resources. \n\nAlthough previous studies have investigated the neural bases associated with comprehending time-compressed speech, none have investigated the adaptation process that occurs when listeners are first confronted with this unusual manipulation of the speech stream. For instance,   reported that processing time-compressed speech strongly recruits bilateral auditory cortices, among other regions. Similarly,   found that activation in left superior temporal sulcus (STS) increased as sentence compression rate increased up to 30% of the original duration. Further compression, however, rendered the speech unintelligible and reduced activation in left STS. In contrast, right STS activation increased linearly, even at the highest levels of compression where speech was no longer intelligible. These results suggest two different processing mechanisms: a left hemisphere linguistic component responding to the content of the sentences and a right hemisphere acoustic component responding primarily to the complexity of the acoustic signal. Neither study, however, investigated the adaptation process \u2014 in fact, Peelle et al. familiarised listeners with the sound of time-compressed speech prior to taking part in the fMRI experiment specifically to avoid this confound. As a result, it is unclear which neural systems are responsible for this rapid perceptual adaptation. \n\nIn the present study, we aimed to address this question by monitoring the on-line adaptation process while participants performed a speeded sentence verification task on time-compressed sentences. The goal of the present study, therefore, was to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying the adaptation process itself, instead of the specific neural activation pattern for processing time-compressed speech, as was the case in previous studies. \n\nIn the field of speech comprehension research, there has been a longstanding debate about which mechanisms are required for speech processing. One theory holds that only auditory processes are required for effective speech perception ( ). A competing theory claims there is an additional role for the motor (i.e. speech production) system and is derived from Liberman's Motor Theory of Speech Perception ( ). In its original form, MTSP claimed: first, that speech tokens such as words, phonemes or phonetic features can only be recognized by mapping acoustic patterns onto articulatory (motor) plans and second, that speech processing involves a tight coupling between auditory and motor processes. The former claim is clearly incorrect ( ). Recent studies, however, have found support for a tight coupling between perception and production systems ( ) by showing the involvement of the speech motor system in speech perception tasks ( ).   provided perhaps the clearest evidence by using transcranial magnetic stimulation to show that stimulation of left ventral premotor cortex (PMv) disrupted speech perception when syllables were embedded in noise without affecting a similar control task of detecting tones in noise. In short, there is renewed interest in the involvement of the motor (i.e. articulatory) system in speech perception, although not in the form of Liberman's original Motor Theory. \n\nCrucially, the two accounts make different predictions about the neural mechanisms involved in the adaptation process. The former predicts that it is done purely acoustically by recognizing distorted signals as instances of abstract auditory prototypes such as phonemes or phonological word forms. Consequently, adaptation-related activation changes would be expected solely in auditory regions associated with speech perception ( ). The latter, however, predicts that the distorted acoustic signal is recognized at least in part by mapping it onto articulatory motor plans \u2014 a form of sensorimotor integration that implicitly simulates the motor patterns used to produce a comparable spoken sentence. In this case, adaptation-related activation would be expected in both auditory regions as well as in ventral premotor regions associated with speech production ( ). \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-two participants (13M, 9F) took part in the study although four (2M, 2F) were subsequently excluded due to: i) excessive head motion (>\u00a010\u00a0mm), ii) an unexpected brain abnormality, iii) chance level performance in the scanner, and iv) an error acquiring the scanning data. The 18 remaining participants were right-handed, native speakers of British English (mean 26.7\u00a0years, median 22.5\u00a0years, range 18\u201360\u00a0years) without any history of neurological or psychiatric disease. The behavioural and neuroimaging data from the older participant (the one 60\u00a0year-old) did not differ qualitatively from the younger participants and therefore was included in all analyses. None had any form of oral or written language impairment or any previous experience with time-compressed speech. None of the participants reported any hearing difficulties, but were not audiometrically screened. In-scanner preliminary testing revealed that all participants could hear the stimuli clearly enough to perform the task (see  , below). All gave written informed consent and were paid for their participation. The study was approved by the NHS Berkshire Research Ethics Committee. \n\n\n### Task \n  \nThe task was a computerized version of the Speech and Capacity of Language Processing Test, or SCOLP ( ). Participants listened to a simple sentence and decided whether it was true or false, indicating their response with a button press. In all cases, the validity of the sentence was obvious (e.g., \u201cBedroom slippers are made in factories\u201d vs. \u201cNuns are made in factories\u201d) with invalid sentences generated by changing participants and predicates from true sentences (see  ) for additional task details). Accuracy and response times were recorded per trial and adaptation to time-compressed speech was operationalized as the increase in the speed of sentence verification times. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nThe auditory stimuli were recordings of 200 SCOLP sentences, 100 true and 100 false, by a male Southern Standard British English speaker. The recordings were made in an anechoic room directly onto digital auditory tape (DAT), while the digital output from the DAT recorder was fed to the digital input of the sound card in the PC. Next, all sentences were saved into separate files with the beginning and ends trimmed at zero crossings as closely as possible to the onset/offset of the initial/final speech sounds and re-sampled at 22050\u00a0Hz. The time-compressed sentences were obtained using PSOLA ( ), as implemented in the Praat software package ( ). Two versions of each recorded sentence were created: sentences resynthesized at 100% of their original duration (normal-speed sentences) and resynthesized sentences shortened to 45% of their original duration (time-compressed sentences). The normal sentences were resynthesized to ensure that any differences between the two types of sentences were due solely to the time compression and not the resynthesis process. The sentences consisted of 6.5 syllables on average (range 3\u201312 syllables, range 477\u20131221\u00a0ms) and the average speech rate of the normal-speed sentences was 4.1 syllables per second, and the average speech rate of the time-compressed sentences was 9.2 syllables per second. Finally, each sentence was peak-normalized at 99% of its maximum amplitude and scaled to 70\u00a0dB SPL using Praat. Stimulus presentation and response time measurement were performed using Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA). \n\n\n### Design and procedure \n  \nThe main experiment used an atypical block design in which all the normal-speed sentences (  n  \u00a0=\u00a064) occurred in the first half of the experiment and all the time-compressed sentences (  n  \u00a0=\u00a064) in the second half. This was necessary because pilot testing in the scanner demonstrated that alternating blocks of normal-speed and time-compressed sentences during scanning prevented behavioural adaptation \u2014 in fact, participants found both types of speech much more difficult. Consequently, the design shown in   was used to allow listeners to get used to the task and to the scanner noise during the presentation of the 64 normal-speed sentences and to allow them to efficiently tune into the time-compressed sentences in the second block. Such a design is similar to pharmacological fMRI studies where the time course of the pharmacological agent often makes it impossible to alternate between drug and non-drug conditions. Like those studies, we specifically looked for interactions between our experimental conditions and time to exclude non-specific effects of time such as scanner drift and physiological noise aliasing ( ). \n\nA single trial began with a tone signal of 100\u00a0ms, followed by a pause of 100\u00a0ms, and then the auditory sentence ( ). The inter-trial interval varied randomly between 4000\u20136000\u00a0ms providing a jittered sampling of the evoked haemodynamic response function ( ). Although the stimuli were presented and analysed in an event-related design, trials occurred in short mini-blocks of four sentences followed by a silent baseline trial (duration randomly varied from 4000\u20136000\u00a0ms) to maximize statistical power. The entire duration of the run was 17\u00a0min. \n\nAfterwards, a second (behavioural) test was run outside the scanner to determine whether adaptation was stable after the scanning session or whether it continued in the quieter environment. Participants were tested individually in a quiet room using headphones (Philips SBC HN110) immediately following the fMRI experiment. 64 new time-compressed sentences were presented. Presentation of all three sets of 64 sentences (normal-speed, time-compressed, and the time-compressed sentences in the post-task) was counter-balanced across subjects. Each set consisted of 32 true and 32 false sentences. The sentences were presented in a semi-randomised order per participant and true and false sentences were counter-balanced across experimental blocks. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nScanning was performed at the Birkbeck-UCL Neuroimaging (BUCNI) Centre on a 1.5\u00a0T MR scanner (Siemens Avanto, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). The experiment began by acquiring a high-resolution structural scan (3D Turbo-FLASH, TR\u00a0=\u00a012\u00a0s, TE\u00a0=\u00a05.6\u00a0ms, 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm resolution) used for anatomical localisation. Next, participants were familiarised with the task during a brief practice run using six normal-speed sentences not included in the rest of the experiment. They were instructed to respond through a button press with their right index finger when the sentence was true and with their right middle finger when the sentence was false. The sentences were presented over electro-static headphones (MRConFon, Magdeburg, Germany) during continuous scanner acquisition (GE-EPI, TR\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0s, TE\u00a0=\u00a050\u00a0ms, 192\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0192 FOV, 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064 matrix, 35 axial slices, yielding a notional 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm resolution) \u2014 in other words, over the noise of the scanner. The main experiment lasted just under 17\u00a0min and on average, 332\u00a0volumes (range: 330\u2013336) were collected per participant. The presentation of the four blocks of normal sentences lasted on average 172\u00a0volumes (43 per block) for the normal-speed sentences, and 151\u00a0volumes (38 per block) for the time-compressed sentences. In other words, slightly less data were collected for the time-compressed sentence conditions because, by definition, the duration of the sentences was shorter. In theory, this may slightly reduce BOLD signal sensitivity for time-compressed relative to normal-speed sentences, but this was unavoidable given the nature of the experiment. \n\nThe choice of continuous, rather than sparse, sampling was based on a trade-off between the ability to reliably detect adaptation-related changes in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal and the length of the experiment. Continuous sampling results in both acoustic masking of the auditory sentences ( ) and contamination of the BOLD signal response in auditory regions ( ). The former, however, was not a problem as a relatively quiet acquisition sequence (\u223c\u00a080\u00a0dB SPL) coupled with sound attenuating headphones (\u223c\u00a030\u00a0dB attenuation) ensured that the sentences were easily heard. Indeed, all participants confirmed their ability to hear and understand the sentences during this practice session. Contamination of the BOLD signal was potentially more problematic because scanner noise elevates BOLD responses in auditory areas ( ), and these effects need not be identical across regions ( ). In the current experiment, however, we were specifically interested in reductions in BOLD signal that index adaptation-related changes. As a result, elevated BOLD responses   per se   were not problematic; only responses driven to saturation levels by the scanner noise would reduce sensitivity and previous studies have clearly shown that typical EPI sequences reduce, but do not eliminate, the dynamic range of the BOLD response ( ). Moreover, although some \u201csilent\u201d imaging protocols exist ( ) they are not yet widely available. fMRI systems without these protocols (such as our own) require silent periods between volume acquisitions lasting between 16 and 32\u00a0s to avoid scanner-noise contamination and ensure an adequate sampling of the evoked haemodynamic response function (HRF) ( ). A sparse design would therefore result in our experiment lasting between 54 and 90\u00a0min, which was deemed likely to seriously reduce participant's performance due to fatigue. As a result, we chose to use a continuous sampling paradigm instead. One consequence of this choice was that the adaptation task was performed over the background noise of the scanner, and it became an empirical question whether embedding its noise would alter the typical behavioural profile of rapid adaptation. \n\n\n### Analyses \n  \nResponse times (RT) were measured from the end of each audio file, following  , and RTs beyond 3000\u00a0ms were trimmed without replacement (0.4%). Each set of sentences was divided into four blocks of 16 so that the time course of adaptation could be examined. A 16 sentence block-size was used because pilot testing revealed that learning was typically stable after 14\u201318 sentences and smaller windows reduce the accuracy of estimating induced BOLD signal responses ( ). The mean RT of correct responses was used in the group analyses. Both accuracy and RTs were evaluated with a repeated-measures 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04 ANOVA with Speech Type (normal-speed, time-compressed) and Block (1\u20134) as independent factors. Obviously, adaptation to the time-compressed sentences was only possible in the second half of the experiment. Consequently, our   a priori   hypothesis was that we would observe adaptation effects only for time-compressed and not normal-speed sentences. \n\nThe functional imaging data were analysed using FSL ( ). After deleting the first three volumes of each run to allow for T1 equilibrium, the functional images were realigned to correct for small head movements ( ). The images were then smoothed with a 6\u00a0mm FWHM Gaussian filter and pre-whitened to remove temporal auto-correlation ( ). The resulting images were entered into a subject-specific general linear model with eight conditions of interest: four blocks of normal-speed and four blocks of time-compressed sentences. Each sentence was convolved with a double gamma \u201ccanonical HRF\u201d ( ) to generate the regressors. The onset of this HRF function was aligned with the onset of every sound file and the duration of every sentence was included in the model. Temporal derivatives were also included to better fit small deviations in the expect time course. Both the data and the model were high-pass filtered at 1/200\u00a0s to remove low frequency signal drifts such as aliased cardiac or respiratory signals without affecting the more rapid, experimentally-induced frequencies such as those between mini-blocks and blocks of stimuli. Finally, each anatomical T1 scan was registered to the MNI-152 template using an affine transformation ( ), which was then applied to the first-level parameter and variance estimates. These were fed into a second-level mixed-effects analysis for inferring across the population ( ). \n\nLinear weighted contrasts were used to identify three effects of interest. First, the main effect of processing auditory sentences relative to scanner noise (when no sentence was presented) was computed to identify task-relevant brain regions using a contrast of [+\u00a01 +\u00a01 +\u00a01 +\u00a01 +\u00a01 +\u00a01 +\u00a01 +\u00a01] where the first four conditions are the four blocks of normal-speed sentences and the last four of the blocks of time-compressed sentences. Significant activations were assessed with a cluster-based correction for multiple comparisons using a height threshold of   Z  \u00a0>\u00a03.5 and a corrected   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05 cluster-extent ( ). This corresponded to a minimum of 123 contiguous 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0mm voxels with   Z  -scores of 3.5 or greater. Next, we identified the regions within this system that were significantly more active for time-compressed relative to normal speech using the same statistical criteria and a contrast of [\u2212\u00a01/4 \u2212\u00a01/4 \u2212\u00a01/4 \u2212\u00a01/4 +\u00a01/4 +\u00a01/4 +\u00a01/4 +\u00a01/4]. Finally, the critical analysis aimed to identify areas within this system involved in adapting to time-compressed speech. To do this, we used a contrast that followed the behavioural profile of adaptation, namely greater activation for the first block of time-compressed sentences than the remaining three blocks [0\u00a00\u00a00\u00a00 +\u00a01 \u2212\u00a0 /  \u2212\u00a0 /  \u2212\u00a0 / ]. It is worth noting, however, that this contrast may be confounded with linear time effects such as scanner drift or physiological noise that are not completely removed by high-pass filtering. Consequently, the contrast was inclusively masked (at   Z  \u00a0>\u00a03.5) by two other contrasts to ensure the effects were due to adaptation rather than scanner drift. The first was the main effect of sentence processing, to limit the results to areas specifically involved in the task [+\u00a01 +\u00a01 +\u00a01 +\u00a01 +\u00a01 +\u00a01 +\u00a01 +\u00a01], while the second was the contrast between the first block of time-compressed sentences and the last block of normal-speed sentences [0 0 0 \u2212\u00a01 +\u00a01 0 0 0]. Here we assumed that time-compressed sentences would significantly increase processing demands relative to normal sentences, consistent with the reaction time cost of switching to time-compressed sentences (see below). Importantly, this difference goes in the opposite direction to the time confound in the main contrast and helps to exclude activation unrelated to adapting to time-compressed speech. Significance was assessed using a small volume correction ( ) based on the smoothness and volume of the intersection of the inclusive masks. Within this reduced volume, a voxel-wise height threshold of   Z  \u00a0>\u00a03.0 corresponded to   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05, one tailed. To illustrate the regional activation profiles, the mean parameter estimates per condition per participant were extracted from the activation cluster. Note that post-hoc t-tests are Bonferroni corrected to adjust for multiple comparisons except where correcting was less conservative (as stated in the text) and significance was assessed at   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behaviour \n  \n shows the results for the error rates and the response times recorded inside and outside the scanner. In order to illustrate the time course of adaptation, data are shown averaged over each mini-block of four trials by a filled-in circle and error bars indicating the standard error of the mean. Data from four consecutive mini-blocks was then averaged and displayed as a bar plot. These bars corresponded to the blocks of 16 sentences used in the analyses. The data from the mini-blocks were included to provide a more fine-grained temporal resolution of the adaptation process than provided by the larger blocks of 16 sentences and are shown for illustration purposes only; all statistical analyses were performed on the averages across the larger blocks of 16 sentences only. What should be clear from the figure is that despite the noisy environment of the scanner, participants were able to perform the task well. Error rates for normal-speed sentences were only 3% while time-compressed sentences were more difficult, with an average error rate of 16%. This main effect of Speech Type was significant (  F  (1,17)\u00a0=\u00a0196.8,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.0001, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.92), but the main effect of Block (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a01.7,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.172, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.09) and the interaction (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a01.1,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.378, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.06) were not. In order to determine whether there were any adaptation effects that may have been hidden by the omnibus ANOVA, the normal-speed and time-compressed sentences were re-analysed separately. Normal-speed sentences showed an effect of Block (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a05.6,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.03, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.25), indicating that participants got better at the task over time. Interestingly, there was no equivalent effect for time-compressed sentences (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a01.1,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.306, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.06), suggesting that by the time these sentences began, the participants were essentially acclimated to the task and environment. This is consistent with the fact that errors in the post-scan behavioural test did not significantly differ across blocks (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a02.1,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.115, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.11). In other words, the error rates suggest that participants successfully acclimated to the task within the noisy environment of the scanner before the time-compressed sentences were introduced. \n\nThe analysis of RTs revealed a main effect of Speech Type (  F  (1,17)\u00a0=\u00a080.8,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.0001, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.83), indicating that responses to time-compressed sentences were significantly slower than normal-speed sentences (790 vs. 386\u00a0ms). There was also a main effect of Block (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a05.0,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.004, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.23) that was largely driven by the slowed responses to the first block of time-compressed sentences. When the two types of speech types were analysed separately, normal-speed sentences showed no effect of Block (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a01.58,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.226, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.09), indicating that listeners did not vary significantly in their response times across the four blocks. On the other hand, the analysis of the time-compressed sentences did reveal a significant effect of Block (  F  (3,17)\u00a0=\u00a05.0,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.004, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.23). A series of planned   t  -tests showed that responses to the first block of time-compressed sentences were significantly longer than those to subsequent blocks (all paired   t  -tests,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05). In other words, within the first 16 trials, participants had adapted to the atypical speech signal as evidenced by the fact that RTs in the subsequent blocks were on average 150\u00a0ms faster than the first block of time-compressed sentences. This was further confirmed when the RTs in the post-scan behavioural test did not show a significant effect of Block (  F  (3,17)\u00a0=\u00a02.34,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.085, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.13), confirming that adaptation asymptoted during the 64 trials that occurred within the scanner. \n\n\n### Neuroimaging \n  \nTo begin, we compared blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal across the eight auditory sentence task conditions to fixation in order to identify the system of regions involved in the task. Like previous studies ( ), we found robust activation in primary auditory and auditory association cortices bilaterally, as well as in the deep frontal operculum bilaterally, left prefrontal and premotor cortices, and pre-SMA extending ventrally into the cingulate sulcus (see   for the complete list). The activation in the operculum bilaterally corresponds with earlier findings reported on processing degraded/noisy speech input ( ). \n\nNext, we identified the regions within this system that were more active for time-compressed relative to normal speech ( A and  ). This revealed separate posterior and anterior temporal lobe foci bilaterally. One was located in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) posterior to Heschl's gyrus while the other was located in the lateral portion of Heschl's gyrus as it joins the anterior superior temporal gyrus (STG). In other words, time-compressed sentences produced greater levels of activation in STS and STG compared to normal-speed sentences, consistent with previous reports that activation in these regions increased with the level of speech compression ( ). In addition, we observed activation in pre-SMA (0, +\u00a012, +\u00a060,   Z  \u00a0=\u00a04.0). \n\nOf primary interest, however, were the neural changes associated with adapting to time-compressed speech ( B). Four regions showed adaptation-related activation profiles, illustrated in  . In the left hemisphere, one cluster was located within a region of the ventral bank of posterior STS. Within this area, there was a significant main effect of Stimulus Type (  F  (1,17)\u00a0=\u00a015.5,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.001, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.48) indicating greater activation for compressed relative to normal speech, a main effect of Block (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a05.0,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.004, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.23) and a significant interaction (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a04.3,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.008, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.20). When the two types of speech were analysed separately, normal-speed sentences showed no effect of Block (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a00.68,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.568, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.04), indicating that activation was greater than baseline and stable over all four blocks, mirroring the response time findings. The time-compressed sentences, however, did show an effect of Block (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a05.1,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.004, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.23) which was driven by a significant increase in the magnitude of the activation during the first block of time-compressed sentences (  t  (17)\u00a0=\u00a04.6,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001). Activation levels in the first block of time-compressed sentences more than tripled, signifying a considerable increase in processing demands. By the third block of time-compressed sentences, however, activation had returned to normal sentence processing levels (  t  (17)\u00a0=\u00a01.0,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.319 uncorrected). A second left hemisphere cluster located on the crest of the pre-central gyrus, a region of ventral premotor cortex (PMv), showed essentially the same pattern. Again there were significant main effects of Stimulus Type (  F  (1,17)\u00a0=\u00a07.4,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.014, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.31) and Block (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a03.9,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.014, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.19), as well as a significant interaction (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a03.7,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.016, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.18). Normal sentences showed no effect of Block (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a00.38,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.762, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.02), whereas time-compressed sentences did (  F  (3,51)\u00a0=\u00a04.5,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.007, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0=\u00a00.21). As in the pSTS region, activation levels increased significantly for the first block of time-compressed sentences (  t  (17)\u00a0=\u00a04.0,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.004) and then returned to normal levels by the third block (  t  (17)\u00a0=\u00a00.4,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.679 uncorrected). In short, the activation profile in both left pSTS and left PMv closely matched the response time data. \n\nAdaptation-related changes in the two right hemisphere clusters, on the other hand, showed a slightly different pattern. The first region was located on the anterior crest of STG and extended into the dorsal bank of STS while the other was located more posterior in the ventral bank of STS. In both regions, activation was significantly greater than baseline for normal sentences but was not stable over the four blocks of normal sentences \u2014 instead it monotonically decreased. This was confirmed by a significant main effect of Block (both   F  (3,51)\u00a0\u2265\u00a035.0,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.0001, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0\u2265\u00a00.67) which was also present when normal sentences were analysed separately (  F  (3,51)\u00a0\u2265\u00a02.8,   p  \u00a0\u2264\u00a00.050, partial   \u03b7  \u00a0\u2265\u00a00.14). In both regions, the first block of time-compressed sentences significantly increased activation levels (anterior:   t  (17)\u00a0=\u00a07.0,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001; posterior:   t  (17)\u00a0=\u00a05.7,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001), but only in the more posterior cluster did these return to normal levels (for blocks 3 and 4:   t  (17)\u00a0=\u00a01.8, 1.0,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.092 and 0.352 uncorrected). In the more anterior region, activation remained significantly greater for all blocks of time-compressed relative to normal sentences (for blocks 2\u20134:   t  (17)\u00a0=\u00a04.6, 3.5, 3.8, all   p  \u00a0\u2264\u00a00.012 corrected). In sum, the activation in the left and right-lateralised regions increased strongly for the time-compressed sentences before showing a sharp decline after the first blocks of time-compressed speech. However, the left and right regions differed in their activation pattern for the normal sentences with activation in the left-lateralised regions remaining constant, while activation in the right-lateralised regions declined. This was confirmed by a significant Hemisphere\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Block interaction (  F  (3,54)\u00a0=\u00a02.9,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.045) for normal-speed sentences that used mean BOLD signal from the two left and two right hemisphere areas showing adaptation effects. It is worth noting that the theoretical question of reduced statistical sensitivity for time-compressed sentences appears not to be a major concern in practice, given the large effect sizes and small error variances seen in  . In other words, the sensitivity was sufficient to detect significant BOLD signal effects for both time-compressed sentences as well as the effects of adaptation. \n\nA final set of analyses investigated whether any of the results were related to the presence of semantic violations (by virtue of including true and false sentences together). This analysis modelled true and false sentences separately to avoid the potential confound associated with semantic violations. Although the effect sizes were smaller due to the lower number of cases, the results showed a pattern identical to the analysis with the true and false sentences combined. In other words, the activations associated with adapting to time-compressed speech cannot be attributed to semantic violations present in the false sentences. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current results confirm and extend previous behavioural studies that demonstrate rapid on-line adaptation to atypical speech signals. After hearing just 16 sentences, participants' comprehension was both accurate and much faster than their initial responses to time-compressed speech, despite the concurrent, on-going noise of the MRI scanner. Moreover, the final behavioural test outside of the scanner demonstrated that the adaptation process completed within the first 64 trials as no additional learning took place after scanning. Instead, there was a trend towards slightly faster RTs which did not reach significance but may point to a re-tuning process that occurs after adaptation had been completed ( ), perhaps due to different acoustic environments (i.e. with or without scanner noise). \n\nAdaptation-related changes in neural activation were observed in four separate areas: two in the right hemisphere and two in the left. In the right, the regions were both auditory association areas located in anterior and posterior portions of the STS, respectively. Both showed significant adaptation to normal sentences, with activation decreasing over the first four blocks. When time-compressed sentences were introduced, activation increased dramatically at first and then decreased after the first block, although it did not return to normal levels. This pattern of responses suggests that adaptation may have occurred at an acoustic, rather than linguistic, level for three reasons. First, the initial BOLD signal adaptation coupled with increasing accuracy rates for normal sentences appears to reflect a gradual acclimation to hearing sentences in a noisy environment. This may reflect adaptation occurring at an acoustic, rather than linguistic, level due to the energetic masking of the scanner noise ( ). Second, the fact that the BOLD response did not return to levels associated with normal-speed sentences suggests that activation in these areas may be driven primarily by the condensed acoustic signal rather than by its content. This interpretation is consistent with the findings of  , who demonstrated a linear increase in activation within right STS with increasing time compression, even when the compression level rendered the auditory sentence unintelligible. Finally, a recent study reported stronger interactions between scanner noise and acoustic processing in right hemisphere auditory areas ( ), suggesting greater sensitivity to acoustic over linguistic processing in right auditory cortex. \n\nIn contrast, adaptation-related changes in the left hemisphere may be more directly related to comprehending speech. In both pSTS and PMv, activation was stable over the first four blocks of normal sentences before increasing by 2\u20133 fold for the first block of time-compressed sentences. Activation then decreased to the levels seen for normal sentences. This pattern more closely matched the behaviour and subjective experience of the participants who reported no difficulty with the normal-speed sentences and no difficulty for the time-compressed sentences \u201conce they got used to them.\u201d Again, this result is consistent with those from   who reported a convex response profile for activation in left STS. As time compression increased from 60% to 30% of the original sentence duration, BOLD signal increased. At 15% of a sentence's original duration it was no longer comprehensible and left STS activation reduced to baseline levels. Together with the current results, both studies suggest that adaptation in the left hemisphere regions appears to be at a linguistic level. Moreover, both studies highlight an apparent difference between right and left STS in responding to time-compressed speech: right STS appears to be driven more by the complexity of the acoustic signal while left STS responds more strongly to its linguistic content. This difference is consistent with the theoretical framework of   in which two distinct anatomical streams are involved in processing speech signals. A ventral stream runs along the STS and is primarily concerned with the content of the speech signal while the dorsal stream links posterior auditory cortex to anterior motor regions involved in articulation. Critically, the latter is strongly left lateralised, includes both pSTS and PMv, and provides an anatomical substrate for mapping acoustic speech signals onto frontal lobe articulatory networks. With respect to sensorimotor interactions, it is proposed that sensorimotor integration is subserved by the dorsal stream. \n\nThe anatomy of regions involved in adaptation to time-compressed sentences helps to shed light on the nature of the adaptation mechanism. Specifically, pSTS is a region of auditory association cortex involved in speech perception ( ), as well as perceiving other complex, non-linguistic sounds ( ). In contrast, the pre-central gyrus is part of the premotor cortex, which is involved in the selection and execution of complex motor sequences ( ). PMv, in particular, is closely linked with articulatory motor patterns due to its strong, reciprocal connectivity to the ventral areas of primary motor cortex, which enervate the face, larynx, and tongue ( ). Speech production tasks robustly activate this region ( ). The fact that both sensory and motor areas demonstrate adaptation-related activation profiles, suggests that adapting to atypical speech involves changing sensitivity not only to auditory, but also to motoric cues. One possibility is that the novel acoustic patterns of compressed speech are mapped onto articulatory motor plans as an implicit form of motor simulation. This may aid in recognizing the speech tokens, particularly in challenging listening situations. Indeed, situations such as when the speech signal is either impoverished ( ), masked ( ) or ambiguous ( ) may preferentially recruit speech production regions to aid speech comprehension. \n\nAdapting to time-compressed speech has often been classified as an attention-weighing process in which listeners learn to shift their attention from task-irrelevant to task-relevant auditory cues ( ). Our results indicate that this specific form of perceptual learning may be supported by sensorimotor integration between auditory and speech production areas. For instance, the process of adjusting to distorted acoustic cues may place greater demands on verbal working memory, which engages this left sensorimotor circuit ( ). This account is certainly consistent with the current findings showing increased PMv activation to the initial time-compressed sentences and raises the possibility that adapting to the compressed speech signal depends at least in partly on implicit articulatory simulation to recognize speech tokens in the atypical auditory input. \n\nFinally, it is worth noting that the current findings are consistent with some, but not all, aspects of Liberman's MTSP ( ). Like previous studies, our data demonstrate a clear role of auditory cortex in speech comprehension. According to the original MTSP, this auditory component would be a highly specialised speech-specific module separate from the rest of the auditory system and dedicated to conveying speech to the motor system where it would be identified as a series of articulatory gestures ( ). In contrast, our data identifies a particular region of posterior STS that has also been shown to be involved in processing complex non-speech sounds (e.g.,  ) and thus runs counter to a core theoretical claim of MTSP. Our finding of significant activation in PMv when adapting to time-compressed speech, on the other hand, tends to support the notion that speech production regions may be preferentially recruited to aid speech comprehension in challenging listening situations such as a distorted, degraded or masked speech signal ( ). For example,   showed that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to left PMv disrupted speech perception when syllables were embedded in noise without affecting a similar control task of detecting tones in noise. Additional studies are, however, required to establish whether these regions are   essential   for the adaptation process. \n\nIn summary, although ideal listening conditions facilitate speech perception, they rarely occur in real life. Normal environments are noisy with poor acoustics that degrade an incoming speech signal. As a result, the human speech recognition system seems to have evolved an opportunistic decoding approach that takes advantage of whatever information is available to assist in comprehension. Primarily this relies on auditory information, but other systems including vision ( ), somatosensation ( ) and the motor system (D' ) may provide important additional cues as well. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: tbl1\n### Label: Table 1\nRegion\tHemisphere\tPeak coordinate\tPeak coordinate.1\tPeak coordinate.2\tZ-score\nTemporal lobe\tTemporal lobe\tTemporal lobe\tTemporal lobe\tTemporal lobe\tTemporal lobe\nSTG/STS\tL\t\u2212\u00a058\t\u2212\u00a016\t\u2212\u00a06\t6.6\nSTG/STS\tR\t+\u00a062\t\u2212\u00a012\t\u2212\u00a08\t7.0\nFrontal\tFrontal\tFrontal\tFrontal\tFrontal\tFrontal\nFrontal operculum\tL\t\u2212\u00a032\t+\u00a022\t\u2212\u00a06\t5.5\nFrontal operculum\tR\t+\u00a040\t+\u00a022\t\u2212\u00a08\t4.7\nPars opercularis\tL\t\u2212\u00a048\t+\u00a012\t+\u00a018\t5.4\nPars orbitalis\tL\t\u2212\u00a052\t+\u00a032\t\u2212\u00a08\t4.6\nPre-SMA\tB\t\u00b1\u00a04\t+\u00a02\t+\u00a048\t5.4\nCingulate sulcus\tB\t0\t+\u00a022\t+\u00a040\t5.9\nParietal\tParietal\tParietal\tParietal\tParietal\tParietal\nAnterior SMG\tL\t\u2212\u00a042\t\u2212\u00a022\t+\u00a050\t4.6\nSubcortical\tSubcortical\tSubcortical\tSubcortical\tSubcortical\tSubcortical\nThalamus\tL\t\u2212\u00a08\t\u2212\u00a016\t0\t4.9\nMedial geniculate body\tB???\t\u2212\u00a010\t\u2212\u00a028\t\u2212\u00a010\t4.2\n### Caption\nActivation for auditory sentences (normal-speed and time-compressed) relative to the fixation baseline.\n### Footer\nCoordinates are in MNI standard space.\n\n\n## ID: tbl2\n### Label: Table 2\nRegion\tHemisphere\tPeak coordinate\tUnnamed: 3\tUnnamed: 4\tZ-score\nA.

The present study examined (1) differences in neural recruitment for escalation and de-escalation decisions of prior investments, and (2) how the activations of these brain networks are affected\u00a0by two factors that can arguably modulate escalation decisions: (i) self-responsibility, and (ii) framing of the success probabilities. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nImaging data were obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) applied to 29 participants. A whole-brain analysis was conducted to compare brain activations between conditions. ROI analysis, then, was used to examine if these significant activations were modulated by two contextual factors. Finally, mediation analysis was applied to explore how the contextual factors affect escalation decisions through brain activations. The findings showed that (1) escalation decisions are faster than de-escalation decisions, (2) the corresponding network of brain regions recruited for escalation (anterior cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus) decisions differs from this recruited for de-escalation decisions (inferior and superior frontal gyri), (3) the switch from escalation to de-escalation is primarily frontal gyri dependent, and (4) activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus were further increased in escalation decisions, when the outcome probabilities of the follow-up investment were positively framed; and activation in the inferior and superior frontal gyri in de-escalation decisions were increased when the outcome probabilities were negatively framed. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nEscalation and de-escalation decisions recruit different brain regions. Framing of possible outcomes as negative leads to escalation decisions through recruitment of the inferior frontal gyrus. Responsibility for decisions affects escalation decisions through recruitment of the superior (inferior) gyrus, when the decision is framed positively (negatively). \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nDecision escalation, also called escalation of commitment, refers to a common sunk cost bias in decision making, whereby the decision maker takes into account irrelevant prior information regarding an investment (time, money and/or effort) and consequent emotions, for making future decisions [ ]. Under such circumstances, the mere fact that an investment was made increases the likelihood of further investment, even though it may not be the optimal decision. For example, people may continue investing in a failed project (or stand in a long line at a store), even though the best path forward may be to quit the project (or move to a different line), just because they have already invested in the project (or already spent time standing in one line) [ ]. This decision escalation effect is prevalent, for example, 54% of consumers in one experiment chose a trip based on sunk cost and not its utility [ ]. \n\nThis phenomenon has two characteristics that reflect decision biases deviating from the economic rationality assumption. The first is the decision bias such that action decisions are more consistent with prior choices, even when other information may suggest alternative optimal paths. The second is the violation of the principle of stochastic dominance. When one choice never pays less and can stochastically pay more than a second option, it is stochastically dominant. Two studies have shown that sunk costs can increase the chance of violating this principle when the expected value is low [ ]. Whyte [ ] proposed a gain\u2013loss paradigm to explain decision bias. When the decision frame is negative (i.e., a troubled project), the decision to commit further resources is framed as a choice between losses: a sure loss or a possibility of a larger loss with a chance to return to the reference point. Prospect theory suggests that the decision maker will show risk-taking behavior to avoid a sure loss (i.e., escalation is preferred). Such risk-taking behavior may rely on intuitive processing, rather than on analytical processing. Therefore, some studies have argued that escalation bias can be overcome by deliberate thinking [ ,  ]. Montealegre and Keil [ ] proposed a four-phase de-escalation process that used a systematic procedure for conscious deliberation to make decisions. Based on such insights, it seems that the analytical processing system, slower and more logical, may mediate de-escalation decisions, while the intuitive, gut-feeling-based processing system, faster and more automated, may mediate escalation decisions. \n\nPrior research in sunk costs has reported that the effect exists across different species (such as rats) and is evolutionary [e.g.,\u00a0 ,  ]. Certain neural mechanisms have been identified to be associated with sunk costs. Specifically, it was found that different networks are sensitive to the sunk cost (already invested) amount, and to the incremental (follow-up) cost needed for saving the initial investment [ ]. The former network includes regions involved in risk-assessment, such as the bilateral medial and superior frontal gyri. The latter includes regions involved in reward processing, including the caudate nucleus, and regions involved in conflict monitoring, such as the cingulate gyrus. Haller and Schwabe [ ] found that reduced activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and associated increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), presumably representing deficient integration of emotions into decision processes [ ], is associated with a larger decision escalation bias. Fujino et al. [ ] found that the insula, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are activated during decision escalation. \n\nTogether, these studies demonstrate that decision escalation can be mediated by activity in regions involved in risk aversion states, reward processing, integration of emotions and reflections, self-perception and conflict monitoring [ ,  ,  ]. They also show that different types of decision escalation (e.g., project-continuum paradigm vs. choosing between two alternative sunk costs, see [ ], amounts of sunk cost and required follow-up investment, see [ ], can produce different activation patterns involving different brain regions from the broader abovementioned network of regions. If cognitive processing is to overcome decision-making bias, the neural mechanisms of escalation and de-escalation would be different and may also be affected by different contextual factors. More specifically, we anticipate that brain regions associated with intuitive thinking (system 1) may be more activated when decisions are escalated, while brain regions associated with deliberate thinking (system 2) may be more activated when decisions are de-escalated. \n\nAlthough extant literature has reported certain neural mechanisms associated with sunk costs, there is a key issue that has not been well-studied. That is, what are the neural mechanisms that result in different escalation or de-escalation decisions, and what contextual factors may affect these neural activities? Without such knowledge, it would be difficult to overcome this decision bias. The knowledge has also clinical significance, because decision escalation bias may be accentuated in people with impulse control disorders [ ] including for instance, in gamblers [ ]. \n\nWe hence seek to expand current knowledge of decision escalation, and specifically regarding the brain regions that are recruited for escalation and de-escalation decision. We also investigate the effects of two contextual variables: responsibility and framing conditions. It is important to consider escalation and de-escalation decisions independently, because different brain mechanisms may be involved and can encode rewarding and punishing outcomes differently [ ,  ]. Responsibility and framing are also two common factors that are used to interpret decision escalation from the perspectives of self-justification theory and approach-avoidance theory, respectively [ ,  \u2013 ]. \n\nSelf-justification theory argues that when the person who made the prior decision may feel that s/he is responsible for the negative outcome and consequently tend to commit more resource to the troubled prior project in order to rectify past losses and attempt to justify his/her earlier decisions [ ]. Thus, one\u2019s responsibility for a project is highly related to his/her escalation decisions. In addition, approach-avoidance theory argues that when a goal has both positive and negative aspects and conflicts, the stronger of the two will win [ ]. Escalation decisions usually occur when the drive to encourage persistence (i.e. the reward for goal attainment) seems to be greater than the restraint to encourage abandonment (i.e. the punishment for lost) [ ]. Therefore, framing of the expected outcome (called goal framing) aims to focus one\u2019s attention on positive or negative consequence of a decision, which will influence one\u2019s escalation decisions or de-escalation decisions [ ]. Goal framing is different from other types of framing such as risky choice framing and attribute framing, and would have different effects on decision making. See Levin et al. [ ] for details. \n\nScenarios for decision escalation typically include failed prior projects that need further resource investment. The decision maker may choose to save the project (escalate) or to stop it (de-escalate). Here, we extend previous research on decision escalation in two directions. First, we demonstrate differences between brain networks that govern escalation vs. de-escalation decisions. Second, we account for the role of two contextual factors in affecting sunk cost bias: (1) the framing of information regarding the potential outcome as success/the reward for goal attainment or failure/the punishment for goal failure of the follow-up investment (50% chance to succeed/promotion vs. 50% chance to fail/demotion), and (2) responsibility of the decision maker (whether the initial failed decision is made by the decision maker or others). \n\nIn summary, the paradigm of decision escalation is \u201cwhen decision makers face a prior failed decision and possible outcomes of continuing the project, would they decide to continue or not?\u201d Five theoretical arguments are employed in this research to explain behaviors at different stages of decision escalation and associated neural mechanisms: (1) When decision makers face a failed prior project, their tendency is to escalate the decision in order to revert the situation. This is in line with the arguments of prospect theory and sunk cost effect; (2) When decision makers are responsible for a troubled project, the likelihood of escalation increases based on the self-justification theory. In other words, self-responsibility moderates the sunk cost effect reported in prospect theory; and (3) The likelihood of escalation is affected by the framing of possible outcomes of escalation. The likelihood of escalation is lower in negative framing than in positive framing. In other words, framing moderates the sunk cost effect reported in the prospect theory. This is supported by the approach-avoidance theory and goal-framing effect. Table   shows a summary of these theoretical interpretations and associated hypotheses to be elaborated later.   \nSummary of hypotheses \n  \n\nA 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 experiment was designed and conducted using the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) instrument to explore different neural mechanisms involved in escalation and de-escalation, and how contextual scenarios affect neural processes. The scenarios include two steps: (1) a failed project and (2) potential future outcomes. In prior neuroimaging research on decision escalation, responsibility and framing were mostly constant. They can, however, vary between decision situations. It is therefore important to study their roles, and how they affect the recruitment of brain regions for the escalation and de-escalation decisions. The manipulation of future outcomes (positively versus negatively framed) allows the expected gain\u2013loss to come into the experiment. The approach-avoidance theory suggests that decision makers would prefer options of gains (rewards) to those of losses (punishment). The goal framing indicate that the framing of potential future outcomes may affect decision escalation. \n\nBecause negative information from a troubled project may conflict with a decision maker\u2019s existing belief, decisions to escalate failed investments may involve consonance restoration (i.e., trying to ensure that one\u2019s prior decisions, perceptions and future actions are consistent with one another), emotion processing and attempts to save one\u2019s self-image [ ,  \u2013 ]. It is reasonable to hypothesize that neural areas associated with consonance restoration and emotional processing such as the ACC, cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus will be higher in escalation decisions (H1). \n\nThe cingulate cortex is involved in conflict monitoring, integration of monetary rewards with motor responses, and connecting emotion and memories [ \u2013 ]; the insula mediates interoceptive awareness processes and serves as a repository for negative emotions and events [ \u2013 ]; and the precuneus mediates self-perception processes [ ]. All of these processes are expected to be activated when a person decides to risk further investment in order to avoid cognitive dissonance and restore his or her self-image. \n\nIn contrast, when a person decides to cut his or her losses, we posit that decisions become more reflection- and inhibition-dependent. They are consequently likely to involve more momentary risk aversion and the mobilization of inhibition efforts to take the avoidance strategy. We therefore expect that in de-escalation decisions, regions associated with system 2 involved in the inhibition of risky suboptimal choices and learning, namely the inferior and superior frontal gyri [ \u2013 ], will be relatively more active (H2). \n\nGiven the central role of responsibility in motivating continued investment in failed projects [ ,  ], we expect that the abovementioned activations in escalation decisions (in the cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus) will be augmented when one\u2019s responsibility is higher compared to when it is lower (H3a). In other words, when one feels more responsible for the failed investment, stronger mental-self considerations are expected [ ] and stronger mobilization of self-image and consonance restoration efforts will be needed. We also expect that when de-escalation decisions are made, low responsibility for past investment should further motivate momentary emphasis on risk aversion. Consequently, inferior and superior frontal gyri are expected to be more activated when the focus that one takes is more on risk aversion than on self- and social-image restoration. We hence anticipate that the expected increased activation in the inferior and superior frontal gyri in de-escalation decisions will be stronger under low responsibility compared to high responsibility conditions (H3b). \n\nLastly, the framing of potential outcomes can lead to more approach (avoidance) decisions when the provided information is positively (negatively) framed as gain (loss) [ ,  ]. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the framing of the success probabilities of the follow-up investment can modulate the effects hypothesized in H1 and H2. We expect that when positive framing is used, a stronger tendency toward escalation decisions (\u201capproach\u201d) will form, and an increase in the associated activity in the regions described in H1 (ACC, insula, cingulate gyrus and precuneus) will be observed (H4a). Similarly, we expect that when negative framing is used, a stronger tendency toward de-escalation decisions (\u201cavoidance\u201d) will form, and an increase in the associated activity in the regions described in H2 (frontal gyri) will be observed (H4b). Table   summarizes all hypotheses. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nFor descriptive purposes, we observe that (1) the overall percentage of escalation decisions and de-escalation decisions were 79.6% and 20.4%, respectively. The percentage of escalation decision was significantly higher than the expected mean value of 0.5 (t\u2009=\u200941.82, p\u2009=\u20090.000); and (2) the time for making escalation decisions (  M  \u2009=\u20091.21,   SD  \u2009=\u20090.23) was significantly shorter (  t  \u2009=\u2009-3.59,   p  \u2009=\u20090.001) than that for de-escalation decisions (  M  \u2009=\u20091.55,   SD  \u2009=\u20090.57). Table   shows the percentage of escalation and the decision time of different scenarios. On average, escalation consumed less decision time than de-escalation. RM-ANOVA revealed that the main effect of framing on escalation decisions was significant (positive framing\u2009>\u2009negative framing;   F  \u2009=\u200911.612,   p  \u2009=\u20090.002), while the main effect of responsibility was not (  F  \u2009=\u20090.319,   p  \u2009=\u20090.577). The main effects indicate that there is no statistically significant difference in escalation behavior between low and high responsibility alone (main effect), but the potential outcomes framed as gains can lead to more escalation decisions than the potential outcomes framed as losses. Moreover, the interaction effect of these two factors was also significant (  F  \u2009=\u200926.165,   p  \u2009=\u20090.000). This means, responsibility alone does not make significant difference, but framing alone and different combinations of framing and responsibility do make differences. In general, the interaction effect needs further analysis when it is significant.   \nThe percentage of escalation decision and decision time for each decision type \n  \n\nFollow-up t-tests on the interaction effect showed that high responsibility conditions increased escalation decisions only when they were positively framed. Unlike expected, high responsibility made it easier for participants to abort the project under negative framing condition. It was marginally significant. Figure\u00a0  shows the escalation percentage and decision time\u00a0under different scenarios. Tables   and   show the result of statistical testing.   \nGraph of interaction effect of responsibility and framing on Escalation decision and decision time \n    \nResults of RM-ANOVA for escalation decisions and decision time \n  \n*  p  \u2009<\u20090.05 \n\n**  p  \u2009<\u20090.01 \n\n***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001 \n    \nResults of paired t-tests for escalation decisions \n  \n p  \u2009<\u20090.10 \n\n*  p  \u2009<\u20090.05 \n\n**  p  \u2009<\u20090.01 \n\n***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001 \n  \n\n\n### FMRI imaging results \n  \nThe objective of the analyses below was to address the following four hypotheses on neural association with decision escalation:  \nH1: activity in the ACC, cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus is higher in escalation decisions. \n\nH2: the inferior and superior frontal gyri are relatively more active in de-escalation decisions. \n\nH3: (a) the abovementioned activations in escalation decisions are augmented in high responsibility conditions, and (b) the abovementioned activations in de-escalation decisions are augmented in low responsibility conditions; and \n\nH4: (a) in positive framing conditions there is stronger activation in the ACC, insula, cingulate gyrus and precuneus; and (b) in negative framing conditions there is stronger activation in the inferior and superior frontal gyri. \n \n\nA whole-brain analysis was conducted to find brain regions associated with escalation decisions and de-escalation decisions. It revealed that the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right cingulate cortex, left insula, right medial frontal gyrus (MFG), and right precuneus were more active in escalation decisions (See Fig.\u00a0 , Panel A and Table  ), while bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left medial frontal gyrus (MFG), and left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) were more active in de-escalation decisions (See Fig.\u00a0 , Panel B and Table  ). Therefore, hypotheses 1 and 2 were supported. Both escalation and de-escalation decisions usually involve using analytical processes or intuitive processes to solve the problems under uncertainty or ambiguous situations. Cingulate cortex and insula activated in escalation decisions involve emotional stimuli, while inferior frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus activated de-escalation involve cognitive stimuli. Obviously, de-escalation decisions are more likely to be related to rational processing than escalation decisions. The test result of response time in Table   also confirmed this. The decision time for de-escalation decision was longer than that for escalation decision, because rational processing usually need more time to elaborate information.   \n Panel A:   Regions showing greater activation in escalation decisions than in de-escalation decisions [  P  \u2009<\u20090.001, corrected (False Discovery Rate), cluster size\u2009>\u2009153, side-bar represents t-statistics].   Panel B:   Regions showing greater activation in de-escalation decisions than in escalation decisions [  P  \u2009<\u20090.001, corrected (False Discovery Rate), cluster size\u2009>\u2009212, side-bar represents t-statistics] \n    \nPeak cluster activation for Escalation\u2009>\u2009De-Escalation and De-Escalation\u2009>\u2009Escalation contrasts \n  \n\nTo test hypotheses on the effect of responsibility (3a-b) and framing (4a-b), ROI masks were created from the WFU PickAtlas Standard Atlases. The contrast analysis, including [High Responsibility\u2009>\u2009Low Responsibility], [Low Responsibility\u2009>\u2009High Responsibility], [Positive Framing\u2009>\u2009Negative Framing], and [Negative Framing\u2009>\u2009Positive Framing], were conducted. Results in Tables   and   showed that no significant activations were found in ACC_R, Cingulate Gryus_R, Insula_L and Precuneus_R for [High Responsibility\u2009>\u2009Low Responsibility] contrast, and in IFG_R, IFG_L, and SFG_L for [Low Responsibility\u2009>\u2009High Responsibility] contrast. Therefore, H3a and H3b were not supported. This result indicates that responsibility alone does not have significant impact on whether the decision is escalated or not. It is consistent with our behavioral finding that the main effect of responsibility was insignificant. Regarding brain areas associated with framing, positive framing strengthened the activations in ACC_R, insula_L, and precuneus_R, and weakened IFG_L activation. Therefore, H4a and H4b were partially supported when the outcome framing was positive.   \nResults of ROI analyses for brain regions hypothesized to be involved in escalation decisions \n  \n p  \u2009<\u20090.10 \n\n*  p  \u2009<\u20090.05 \n\n**  p  \u2009<\u20090.01 \n\n***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001 \n    \nResults of ROI analyses for brain regions hypothesized to be involved in de-escalation decisions \n  \n p  \u2009<\u20090.10 \n\n*  p  \u2009<\u20090.05 \n\n**  p  \u2009<\u20090.01 \n\n***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001 \n  \n\nBecause H3a-b was not supported, we further examined the interaction effect of responsibility and framing. Additional contrast analyses were conducted, including [High Responsibility\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Positive Framing\u2009>\u2009Low Responsibility\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Positive Framing], [High Responsibility\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Negative Framing\u2009>\u2009Low Responsibility\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Negative Framing], [Low Responsibility\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Positive Framing\u2009>\u2009High Responsibility\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Positive Framing], and [Low Responsibility\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Negative Framing\u2009>\u2009High Responsibility\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Negative Framing]. The results in Tables   and   showed that there was no significant activation in brain regions hypothesized to be involved in escalation decisions, but activations of all brain regions hypothesized to be involved in de-escalation decisions (i.e. IFG_L, IFG_R, and SFG_L) were weakened by responsibility when messages were framed positively. Therefore, H3b (the inferior and superior frontal gyri are more activated for de-escalation under the low responsibility scenario) was supported under the positive framing condition.   \nResults of post Hoc analysis for High Self-Responsibility\u2009>\u2009Low Self-Responsibility in brain regions hypothesized to be involved in Escalation decisions \n    \nResults of post Hoc analysis for Low Self-Responsibility\u2009>\u2009High Self-Responsibility in brain regions hypothesized to be involved in De-Escalation decisions \n  \n\nIn order to know whether IFG and SFG mediate the effect on escalation decision, we further performed mediation tests. They showed that the IFG mediated the effect of framing on escalation decisions under the responsibility and negative framing conditions; and that SFG activation mediated the effect of responsibility on escalation decisions under positive framing conditions. \n\n\n### Post-Hoc mediation analysis \n  \nMediation models were conducted post-hoc to explore whether the brain activations associated with escalation and de-escalation mediated the relationship between responsibility/framing and escalation decision. As shown in Table  , there was an interaction effect between responsibility and framing on escalation decision. The mediating role of brain activations, then, was examined for each of three significant conditions in Table  . The mediation model included treatment (i.e. responsibility or framing) as the predictor, escalation decision as the dependent variable, brain activations from each of the four escalation ROIs and the two de-escalation ROIs as the mediator. Analyses were run using SPSS macro PROCESS with significance determined by 95% confidence interval (CI) based on 1000 bootstrapped samples. The results showed that only the brain regions associated with de-escalation (i.e. IFG and SFG) play mediating role between responsibility/framing and escalation decision (as shown in Figs.\u00a0 ,  ,  ). First, the IFG mediated the effect of framing on escalation decision under high responsibility condition. When the responsibility is high, negative messages may increase the activation of IFG, and then inhibited the subjects\u2019 escalation decision (see Fig.\u00a0 ). As shown in Fig.\u00a0 , under negative framing condition, the activation of IFG was higher, while the subjects\u2019 escalation decision was lower. Moreover, as the activation of IFG increased, subjects\u2019 escalation decision decreased. This is   why positive messages are more likely to lead to escalation decision than negative messages under high responsibility condition   (As tested in Table  ). In addition, the IFG also mediated the relationship between responsibility and escalation decision under negative framing condition. Responsibility is positively associated with IFG activation, and leads to prohibit the escalation behavior while receiving negative messages (See Fig.\u00a0 ). As shown in Fig.\u00a0 , under high responsibility condition, the activation of IFG was higher, while the subjects\u2019 escalation decision was lower. Moreover, as the activation of IFG increased, subjects\u2019 escalation decision decreased. This explains the marginally significant result in Table  . That is,   high responsibility would contribute to de-escalation decision under negative framing condition  . Finally, the SFG played a mediation role in the effect of responsibility on escalation decision under positive framing condition. When the subjects received positive messages,   higher responsibility inhibited SFG activation, which resulted in increased escalation decision   (See Fig.\u00a0 ). As shown in Fig.\u00a0 , under high responsibility condition, the activation of SFG was lower, while the subjects\u2019 escalation decision was higher. Moreover, as the activation of SFG decreased, subjects\u2019 escalation decision increased. This finding illustrated the role of SFG in the mechanism of high responsibility on escalation decision under positive framing condition, as shown in Table  .   \nMediation Model under High Responsibility Condition: framing influences escalation decision through IFG under high responsibility condition \n    \nMediation Model under Negative Framing: responsibility influences escalation decision through IFG under negative framing condition \n    \nMediation Model under Positive Framing Condition: responsibility influences escalation decision through SFG under positive framing condition \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study sought to shed light on (1) differences between the neural underpinnings of escalation and de-escalation decisions, and on (2) how these neural processes may be modulated by key contextual/confounding variables. \n\nThe first objective was addressed with H1 and H2. They were supported. The results indicated that escalation decisions engage clusters in the right anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior parts of the cingulate gyrus, precuneus and medial frontal gyrus, as well as a cluster in the left insula. This activation pattern supports the prospect theory perspective that suggests when decision makers face a failed project, they are more likely to avoid losses and choose the risky option (escalation) than maintaining the status quo. That is, escalation decisions require observing the conflict between the choices of accepting the loss and loss recovery (i.e., attempts to overcome past loses, through further or increased investing), and that they are motivated by self-image and interoceptive-awareness [ ,  ] as well as by cognitive consonance restoration [ ]. In contrast, de-escalation decisions engaged clusters in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, and left superior and medial frontal gyri that are more consistent with analytical thinking. This activation pattern supports the postulation that de-escalation requires stronger focus on momentary risk aversion and inhibition [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nAn interesting finding from the study is that the neural mechanisms that lead to escalation or termination of\u00a0a failed project are different. The former involves more intuitive and emotional decision system (system 1), while the latter involves more of the deliberative system (system 2) [ ,  ]. This is also consistent with our behavioral findings that the average time for escalating decisions was shorter than that that for de-escalation. A further question would be whether personality affects individual\u2019s escalation decision. Fujino et al. [ ] reported that individuals who tend to adhere to social rules and regulations are more susceptible to the sunk cost effect. Our findings of high responsibility lead to higher escalation is consistent with their finding of personality, as the tendency to adhere to social rules and regulations is more likely to generate higher perceived responsibility. Another issue worth further investigation is whether the risk attitudes of individuals affects their decision escalation. Theoretically, risk takers are more likely to escalate their decisions. Empirical validation, however, will be necessary. \n\nAdding to this, the behavioral results showed that escalation decisions were made significantly faster compared to de-escalation decisions. This supports the assertion that while de-escalation decisions may be associated with more-reflective-analytical mode, escalation decisions are made in a more intuitive mode that focuses on peripheral (e.g., saving self-image) route (system 1) rather than central route (system 2). This view extends extant neuroimaging works on decision escalation after an initial investment [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nThe second objective of the study was addressed the effect of responsibility and outcome framing with H3a-b and H4a-b, respectively. H3a proposed that activation of the cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus will be further increased in escalation decisions, when responsibility is high. H3b suggested that the increased activation of the inferior and superior frontal gyri in de-escalation decisions will be further increased when responsibility is low. Both parts of the hypothesis were not supported. A post-hoc analysis provided partial support for H3b by showing that it may hold true only under positive rather than negative outcome framing conditions. This illuminates the need to account for confounding variables in decision escalation research. These results can be explained by the idea that positive framing is perceived by the decision maker as a potential to gain benefits and hence create additional motivation to escalate the investment, and de-escalation when responsibility was low required additional neural risk aversion and inhibition efforts (i.e., system 2). These efforts are presumed to manifest in increased activation of the frontal gyri. Together, these findings suggest that responsibility, at least in the examined task, is not always confounded in escalation and de-escalation decisions; it becomes relevant only for de-escalation decisions when the success of the follow-up investment is positively framed. \n\nThe mediation models contribute to the big picture by showing that while, as expected, different networks are activated in escalation and de-escalation decisions, the switch between such decisions is primarily dependent on inferior and superior frontal gyri regions, which mediate the integration of contextual information, such as framing and responsibility, into escalation vs. de-escalation decisions. This is in line with the functional role of frontal gyri regions in learning and decision making [ ,  ]. \n\nPrevious works have indicated that IFG plays an important role in executive control and inhibiting inappropriate response [ \u2013 ]. This is consistent with our mediation analysis results. More specifically, IFG played a mediating role in the relationship between framing and escalation decisions under high responsibility condition (Fig.\u00a0 ) as well as the relationship between responsibility and escalation decisions under negative framing condition (Fig.\u00a0 ). In other words, decision makers may reduce the possibility of choosing the risky escalation behavior through the activation of inhibition control mechanism under high responsibility and negative outcome framing. Positive outcome framing, on the other hand, may induce a decision maker\u2019s belief that the project is more likely to succeed [ ,  ], which leads to higher activation of the intuitive decision mechanism to escalate the decision. \n\nIn summary, the effect of responsibility on escalation reported in previous literature was not supported in our study (the main effect in Table  ). The rationale behind the effect of responsibility is \u201cthe greater responsibility one takes, the stronger motivation for rectifying past losses and justifying their earlier decisions would reveal\u201d [ ]. That is, decision makers tend to make the decision in a way that is consistent with the prior decision in order to appear rational in their decisions. Arkes and Blumer [ ] also reported moderate support that personal involvement increases the sunk cost effect. Our findings do not fully support the argument. Nonetheless, we found that stronger sunk cost effect that leads to escalation decisions when high responsibility and positive outcome expectation are present. The percentage of escalation increases from 74.2% in negative framing to 98.4% in positive framing (see Fig.\u00a0 ). This conditional finding of responsibility adds new insight into this aspect. \n\nThe effect of outcome framing on escalation decision can be explained from the approach-avoidance theory [ ]. That is, positive framing provides information of possible gains that decision makers would pursue while negative framing informs possible loss that decision makers tend to avoid. The positive framing focuses attention on the expected gains that makes it easier to self-justify a commitment of more resources (approach) and hence encourages a decision maker to take risks associated with escalation, while the negative framing leads to the other way around (avoidance). \n\nIn our study, we found that activation of the cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus increased in escalation decisions (H4a), when the success probabilities of the follow-up investment are positively framed; activation of the inferior and superior frontal gyri increased in de-escalation decisions, when the success probabilities of the follow-up investment are negatively framed (H4b). H4a indicates that brain regions typically associated with system 1 (e.g., ACC and insula) and the midline structure associated with \u201cself\u201d (e.g., precuneus and medial FG) are more activated when decisions are escalated. H4b indicates that brain regions associated with system 2 (e.g., IFG and SFG) are more activated while decisions are de-escalated. The findings support the asymmetry effect of gain\u2013loss, but the activated brain areas are different from those reported in Jessup and O\u2019Doherty [ ] whose study reports that brain regions including lateral orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insular cortex, and ACC show an increase in activities to both rewarding and punishing events, while medial frontal cortex and part of ventral striatum responded selectively to the rewarding but not punishing outcomes. This may be due to different experimental settings and also implies that more research is needed. To summarize,   our findings on outcome framing are an important contextual extension of prior research on decision escalation   [ ,  ,  ]. We show here that not only framing influences escalation and de-escalation decisions when facing sunk costs, but also expands the separation between the neural activations of brain networks involved in escalation versus de-escalation decisions. \n\nDecision biases occur when objectively equivalent probability is presented as either positive framing or negative framing. As shown in Table  , negatively framed messages have a lower frequency of escalation biases than positively framed messages under high responsibility condition. In addition, the mediation model showed that negative framing increased IFG activation and further contributed to de-escalation decision. From a practical standpoint, our findings suggest that   decision escalation bias can be alleviated by using more negatively framed success probabilities of follow-up investments, especially under high responsibility condition.   For example, if a person wants to avoid exceeding his or her gambling limit, he or she should think about the probabilities of losing rather than winning the next bet. Similarly, managers should focus on project failure probabilities rather than on success probabilities in order to reduce the risk of being biased by sunk costs. The efficacy of such approaches, though, requires further research. The neural findings further shed light on the brain underpinnings of the shift from image saving to risk aversion focus. This suggests that people with deficits in the abovementioned brain networks may be more (or less) susceptible for decision escalation bias. While some evidence for such effects exists (e.g., it has been shown that gamblers differ from non-gamblers in their follow-up responses to wins and losses, see [ ], future research should more closely examine how deficits in any of the brain regions examined here can affect escalation decisions. Future research may also examine the effects of therapies on sunk cost decisions of patients. For example, the ACC tends to be hyper-active in major depressive disorder and in bi-polar disorder subjects; and pharmacological and brain stimulation treatments can reduce ACC activity [ ]. The implications of such treatments for decision making in response to sunk costs are unknown, and should be examined. \n\nAnother way to attenuate escalation behavior is to decrease the responsibility of decision makers, so as to reduce their discomfort and moderate their tendency to affirm the correctness of their original belief [ ,  ]. Low responsibility may help decision makers control and regulate uncomfortable feeling in the pursuit of better results. The result from our mediation analysis (Fig.\u00a0 ) supports the argument as superior frontal gyrus (SFG) played a mediating role. SFC is a brain area generally believe to correlate with cognitive control, negative feeling regulation, and risk aversion [ \u2013 ]. Lower responsibility of a decision maker may lead to avoiding risky behavior by more activation of SFG. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nSeveral limitations of this study are noteworthy. First, the task had fixed success of follow-up investment probabilities, it belonged to the investment-continuum paradigm, and it did not vary the prior investment and follow up costs. Hence, the generalizability of our findings should be extended, by for example, replicating the study while using different decision scenarios, different success probabilities, and different levels of prior and needed investments. Second, the responsibility manipulation did not produce strong neural effects. Different tasks and manipulations may be developed in future research to better elicit such effects. Third, some potential confounding factors such as the forced choice in the experiment and project size (million dollars vs. billion dollars) can be accounted for in future research. Fourth, the decision was targeted at a single decision stage and did not explore the complexity of multi-stage situations; this is a fruitful area for expansion. In addition, we focused on one biasing aspect of sunk cost, and did not delve into nuanced biases, such as the ability of sunk cost to drive violations of the stochastic dominance principle [ ]. This also represents an important area for future research. Moreover, inferring value assessment from brain imaging data is difficult [ ]. Future studies can use additional experiments to more directly relate value judgments to sunk cost situations. Lastly, this study did not consider attributes of the decision makers, such as personality (especially agreeableness and conscientiousness, see Fujino et al. [ ], experience and age of the subjects. Future research may extend our findings by integrating more covariates and predictors into the model. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nEscalation of commitment to a failed project is a common decision bias. The goal of this study was to identify neural correlates associated with the escalation and de-escalation decision and the effect of responsibility and outcome framing. The findings showed that (1) escalation decisions are faster than de-escalation decisions, (2) the corresponding network of brain regions recruited for escalation (anterior cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus) decisions differs from this recruited for de-escalation decisions (inferior and superior frontal gyri), (3) the switch from escalation to de-escalation is primarily frontal gyri dependent, and (4) activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus were further increased in escalation decisions, when the outcome probabilities of the follow-up investment were positively framed; and activation in the inferior and superior frontal gyri in de-escalation decisions were increased when the outcome probabilities were negatively framed. The findings shed new insight and contribute toward a better understanding of the mechanism underneath the decision escalation. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study design and procedures \n  \nA 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (responsibility x outcome framing) within-subject factorial design was employed. Responsibility was manipulated by presenting four software projects (see Table  ) in which participants were asked to make an initial project decision regarding the development approach (High responsibility condition) and four other projects presented as having the development approach decided by others in the organization (Low responsibility condition), see Fig.\u00a0  for a sample. In addition, the success or failure of the project would be related to the participants under high responsibility condition (decision scenarios presented as \u201cIf the project fails, it means you are incapable.\u201d, see Table  ), but not related to the participants under low responsibility (decision scenarios presented as \u201cIf the project fails, it doesn\u2019t mean you are incapable.\u201d). Framing was manipulated by presenting decision scenarios with foci on either probabilities of success (Positive framing: \u201cIncreasing budget will have a half chance of succeeding with the project\") or probabilities of failure (Negative framing: \u201cIncreasing budget will have a half chance of failing with the project\"). The probability of success and failure was 50%.   \nThe Projects used in the experiment \n    \nProcedure of the Experiment. Designated experimental scenarios were presented to subjects for their decision. High responsibility indicated asked the subject to commit to a choice, while the low responsibility indicated that the decision was done by others \n    \nThe decision scenarios used in the experiment \n  \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-nine participants were recruited with the requirement that they need to have taken at least one Information Systems [IS] course in their college education, 13 females; age range 21\u201333,   M  \u2009=\u200923.6). All were healthy, right-handed, experiment na\u00efve, and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. They had no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders or contraindications to MRI. The experiment was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of National Taiwan University. All participants provided written informed consent and were paid about US$20 for their time. \n\nParticipants were asked to take the role of an Information System [IS] manager of a company, in which they are responsible for managing eight software projects that cost a lot of money and need more money to avoid failure. The original investment was sunk cost. It could not be recovered. For each project, they were given 14 decision scenarios in which the projects were in trouble. They had to decide whether to escalate (invest more to save the project) or de-escalate (stop the project). \n\n\n### MRI procedure \n  \nBefore the MRI scanning, participants were given 10\u00a0min for reading the descriptions of all eight project scenarios. Then, they were screened for physical and psychiatric disorders. No exclusions were made. Scanning commenced with structural acquisition for anatomic normalization (10\u00a0min). Functional scans were acquired from four sessions. In each session, two software projects were randomly assigned (one with high self-responsibility and another with low). Participants were given 20\u00a0s to review the description of each software project scenario. In the high self-responsibility condition they were asked to make an initial decision. Next, they performed 14 trials of project decisions in the different manipulated conditions. In each trial, participants were given a decision message for 6\u00a0s, followed by a decision response (continuing the project or not) for 4\u00a0s. For controlling the clicking movement, the ratio of \u201ccontinue button\u201d on the left side and the right side was counterbalanced. Each participant performed a total of 112 trials. The experimental paradigm is shown in Fig.\u00a0 .   \nExperimental Paradigm. The problem for requesting an increase of financial commitment was presented to the subject and then ask for the subject to decide whether to stop the project \n  \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nSituation\tTheoretical arguments\tHypotheses\nQ1: Whether different brain networks govern escalation and de-escalation decisions?\tQ1: Whether different brain networks govern escalation and de-escalation decisions?\tQ1: Whether different brain networks govern escalation and de-escalation decisions?\nEscalation Decisions\tProspect theory: Risk seeking (committing more resources) for lose aversion when receiving negative feedback/facing a troubled project [???]Sunk costs: Committing more resources to save prior investment\u00a0[???]\tNeural areas associated with conflict monitoring, self-perception processes, and emotional processing such as the ACC, cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus will be higher in escalation decisions when a person decides to risk further investment in order to avoid cognitive dissonance and restore his or her self-image.

This period overlaps with the onset of psychopathology such as internalizing and externalizing symptoms. In the current studies, we examined behavioral and neural patterns of dysregulation to social rewards and threats, and links to internalizing and externalizing symptoms in youths. In study 1, we used a social Go/NoGo cognitive control task using peer faces to test for age-related behavioral differences in inhibitory failures in adolescents (  N   = 53, M  = 13.37 years), and adults (  N   = 51, M  = 43.71 years). In study 2, an independent adolescent sample (  N   = 51, M  = 13.98 years) completed a similar social Go/NoGo cognitive control task during fMRI. Results show that adolescents had greater inhibitory failures \u2013 as measured by false alarm rate \u2013 to both social reward and threat cues than adults, and more so to social reward than threat cues. Greater inhibitory failures to social reward than threat cues were associated with greater internalizing symptoms, but were not significantly related to externalizing symptoms. At the neural level, greater inhibitory failures to social reward than threat cues as well as greater internalizing symptoms were both associated with heightened amygdala-ventral striatum connectivity. Our findings indicate that subcortico-subcortical connectivity, which is deemed to occur chronologically earlier and thus necessary for subcortico-cortical circuits, may serve as an early biomarker for emotion dysregulation and a risk factor for internalizing symptoms. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAdolescence is a period of unique development characterized by a social reorientation in the brain ( ). That is, the adolescent brain undergoes neural plasticity and growth during the onset of puberty such that it becomes more sensitive to socially salient stimuli in the environment ( ;  ;  ). During this neurobiological transformation, the adolescent brain shows greater sensitivity to social rewards as evidenced by heightened recruitment of limbic regions (e.g., amygdala, ventral striatum) in response to socially affective cues ( ;  ). This social reorientation explains, in part, why peers become an increasingly powerful influence in adolescents\u2019 lives, and why adolescents become more driven by socially appetitive cues such as social rewards ( ;  ;  ). This bias toward social rewards may facilitate adolescents\u2019 desire to seek and value peer acceptance and group membership more so than children and adults ( ;  ), guiding adolescents to adjust their motivations to match their social context, and needs ( ). While developmentally normative (e.g.,  ), this heightened orientation to peer acceptance and social rewards may lead to emotion dysregulation ( ;  ), and place adolescents at risk for psychopathology ( ). \n\nDuring the adolescent years, a social reorientation toward peers and gaining social acceptance coincides with a heightened risk for psychopathology including internalizing (e.g., depression and anxiety) and externalizing (e.g., impulsivity, aggression, and conduct problems) symptoms (e.g.,  ;  ). Internalizing and externalizing symptoms involve affective dysregulation and compromised executive functioning ( ;  ) such as poorer cognitive control ( ), as measured by lower inhibitory control ( ;  ), and altered reaction times during inhibitory failures ( ;  ). This ultimately has lasting implications on adolescents\u2019 lives (e.g.,  ;  ). For instance, youths with internalizing and externalizing symptoms are more susceptible to experience internalizing disorders and substance use, respectively, in the future (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). Youths with internalizing symptoms also experience social dysfunction such that those who perceive low acceptance tend to be more depressed ( ) while those with externalizing symptoms have atypical socially rewarding experiences ( ). Given the prevalence and enduring impact of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, it is therefore necessary to better understand neurodevelopmental risk factors in youths. \n\nEmotional dys(regulation) is thought to underlie both internalizing and externalizing symptoms in adolescence and arises due to neural changes in the developing brain (e.g.,  ). While many neurodevelopmental models have been proposed to explain adolescents\u2019 enhanced orientation toward social rewards and their subsequent inabilities to engage in effective regulation [e.g., dual systems model ( ); imbalance model ( )], these models and much of the empirical work focuses on cortico-subcortical (e.g., prefrontal cortex-ventral striatum) connectivity. However, prior to the development of down-regulation via the prefrontal cortex, emotional development is marked by a hierarchical cascade of changes in functional connectivity patterns, whereby development of subcortico-subcortical connectivity (e.g., amygdala-ventral striatum connectivity) occurs before that of cortico-subcortical connectivity, and serves as a necessary precursor to more complex neural interactions ( ). \n\nTo date, there has been a wealth of research on amygdala and ventral striatum activation in tandem, however, only a few have probed connectivity between the two subcortical regions in humans. Amygdala-VS connectivity plays a vital role in relevance detection ( ), affective valuation ( ), and incentive-based learning ( ), which may promote downstream motivated cognition, and behavior ( ;  ). Longitudinal ( ) and cross-sectional ( ) studies highlight developmental decreases in amygdala-VS connectivity from childhood to adulthood, suggesting that strengthened connectivity between these regions is a developmentally immature neural phenotype and may underlie difficulties in emotion regulation in adolescence. Indeed, greater amygdala-VS connectivity is associated with behavioral disinhibition to emotional cues ( ), which may place youth at risk for psychopathology. While there indeed is a large body of literature on the links between alternations in amygdala and ventral striatum activation and internalizing and externalizing symptoms in adolescents, especially in a socially rewarding context (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), little to no research has probed how alterations in amygdala-VS connectivity relate to internalizing and externalizing symptoms (but see  ). This calls for further investigation into how maladaptive processing of social rewards relate to subcortico-subcortical connectivity and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. \n\nIn the current studies, we sought to investigate the behavioral and neural correlates of disinhibition to socially affective cues (social rewards and social threats) and links to internalizing and externalizing symptoms in adolescents. In the current study, participants completed a social Go/NoGo task where \u201cgo\u201d and \u201cno-go\u201d cues were superimposed onto social reward (e.g., happy peer face), social threat (e.g., angry peer face), or neutral (i.e., neutral peer face) images. Past studies have utilized similar Go/NoGo tasks to assess inhibitory failures operationalized by false alarm rates (i.e., pressing a button on no-go trials; e.g.,  ;  ). Positive (e.g., happy) and negative (e.g., angry) facial expressions serve as social reinforcers that induce approach/reward and avoidance/threat responses, which can alter the probability of enacting executive functions such as response latencies (e.g.,  ;  ). Thus, happy and angry faces are frequently used in fMRI research to elicit social reward and social threat processing, respectively (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ). Moreover, social reward (happy faces) and social threat (angry faces) cues recruit amygdala-striatal circuitry ( ;  ). \n\nIn study 1, adolescent and adult participants completed the social Go/NoGo task behaviorally to test for developmental differences. The task was developmentally congruent, such that adolescents viewed adolescent faces and adults viewed adult faces. The goal of study 1 was to ensure ecological validity of the task that utilizes peer faces by replicating prior behavioral findings that have shown that adolescents relative to children and adults make more false alarms in the presence of social reward cues ( ;  ). Thus, we hypothesized that adolescents relative to adults would show greater behavioral disinhibition to social reward cues relative to social threat and neutral cues ( ;  ). \n\nIn study 2, an independent sample of adolescents completed the social Go/NoGo task during an fMRI session. Prior developmental neuroimaging work has shown that adolescents show greater amygdala-VS connectivity relative to adults, and heightened connectivity is associated with greater behavioral disinhibition to emotional cues on a social Go/NoGo task ( ). Thus, we hypothesized that greater disinhibition to social reward cues would be associated with greater amygdala-VS connectivity since heightened subcortical coupling is seen as developmentally immature ( ). \n\nFinally, we examined behavioral and neural links with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. At the behavioral level, we hypothesized that greater disinhibition to social reward cues relative to social threat cues would be associated with higher internalizing and externalizing symptoms. At the neural level, we hypothesized that stronger amygdala-VS connectivity to social rewards would be associated with greater internalizing and externalizing symptoms. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants consisted of a community sample recruited via flyers, listservs, and outreach at local events. We obtained informed consent/assent from all participants. The University\u2019s Institutional Review Board approved all procedures and materials. \n\n#### Study 1 (Behavioral) \n  \nParticipants included 51 adults (M  = 43.71 years,   SD   = 6.76 years, range = 27.49\u201355.91 years; 41 female; 31 White, 13 African American/Black, 2 Asian/Pacific Islander, 2 Latino/Hispanic, and 3 multiethnic) and 55 adolescents. Two adolescent participants were excluded from study 1 due to an inability to follow the task instructions, leaving a total of 53 adolescent participants (M  = 13.37 years,   SD   = 0.61 years, range = 12.18\u201314.82 years; 27 female; 25 White, 14 African American/Black, 4 Asian/Pacific Islander, 2 Latino/Hispanic, and 8 multiethnic; Maternal education: 1 some high school, 3 high school degree, 12 some college, 21 college degree, 1 some medical, law, or graduate school, 14 medical, law, or graduate school degree, 1 missing). \n\n\n#### Study 2 (fMRI) \n  \nParticipants included an independent sample of 59 adolescents. 7 participants were excluded from analyses because they could not complete the task properly (e.g., technical problems, misunderstanding of task) and 1 participant was excluded because of excessive motion during the scan. In total, 51 participants were included in the present analyses (M  = 13.98 years,   SD   = 1.24 years, range = 12.03\u201315.94 years; 25 female; 32 White, 9 African American/Black, 1 Asian/Pacific Islander, 1 Latino/Hispanic, and 8 multiethnic; Maternal education: 4 some high school, 4 high school degree, 2 trade or vocational schools, 8 some college, 19 college degree, 3 some medical, law, or graduate school, 11 medical, law, or graduate school degree). \n\n\n\n### Social Go-Nogo Task \n  \n#### Study 1 (Behavioral) \n  \nParticipants completed a behavioral inhibition task, during which they were instructed to inhibit a motor response in the presence of happy, angry, and neutral faces ( ). Participants viewed a sequence of arrows (\u201c<\u201d or \u201c>\u201d) superimposed on top of pictures of faces enclosed within a white rectangular frame. Participants were instructed to press a button with their right or left pointer finger depending on the direction of the arrow. No instructions were given regarding the faces (e.g., participants were not told to attend to the faces in any way). In some trials, the white frame would turn red and participants were instructed to withhold their response if the frame turned red. The faces in the photos were age-matched such that the adolescents viewed photos of adolescents [drawn from the NIMH Child Emotional Faces Picture Set (NIMH-ChEFS);  ] and adult participants viewed adult faces (drawn from the NimStim;  ). Faces were of diverse races and ethnicities. Each photo displayed one of three emotional facial expressions: happy, angry, or neutral. The same faces (with different facial expressions) were displayed in all 3 conditions. \n  \nExample trials of the social stop signal task. Go trials when frame enclosing peer\u2019s photo remains white and No-go trials when frame enclosing peer\u2019s photo turns red. Pictures were taken from a publicly available dataset ( ). Parent permission and actor assent were obtained by a contractual arrangement so that pictures are publicly available for researchers and can be reproduced in scientific dissemination. \n  \nThe task consisted of 207 trials in total, which were divided by emotional facial expression into 3 blocks of 69 trials each. Within each block, two thirds of the trials (46) were \u201cgo\u201d trials, where the correct response was to press a button. One third of the trials (23) were \u201cno-go\u201d trials, where the correct response was to withhold a button press. The direction of the arrow (\u201c<\u201d or \u201c>\u201d) was assigned randomly to each trial. During a go trial, the photo was first presented for 200 ms within the white frame, then an arrow appeared superimposed on top of the photo for 750 ms. Next, the photo and arrow disappeared, leaving only the white frame for a jittered intertrial period. During a no-go trial, the photo was presented for 200 ms within the white frame, then the arrow appeared superimposed on top of the photo for 150 ms, while still enclosed within the white frame. Next, the frame surrounding the photo and arrow turned red for 600 ms. Then the photo and arrow disappeared, and the frame returned to its original white color for the jittered intertrial period. \n\n\n#### Study 2 (fMRI) \n  \nThe task used in study 2 was extremely similar to that described above for study 1 with minor updates to optimize the task for fMRI use. The number of trials was increased to a total of 333 trials with 111 trials per emotion block. The ratio of go to no-go trials was kept at two thirds go (74) trials and one third no-go (37) trials within each block. Additionally, the task was updated so that the task difficulty would adapt to the individual\u2019s performance, ensuring the task is similarly, difficult across participants. Specifically, the amount of time before the frame turned red (referred to here as the \u201cStop Signal Duration\u201d or SSD) on no-go trials adapted to the participants\u2019 performance. The SSD was variable and was determined by the participant\u2019s performance on the task. If a participant successfully withheld a button press on a no-go trial, then the SSD for the next no-go trial would increase by 50 ms, making the task more difficult. Conversely, if a participant failed to withhold their button press on a no-go trial, the SSD for their next no-go trial would decrease by 50 ms. The initial SSD was set to 150 ms, and bounded at 50 ms (minimum) and 350 ms (maximum). A go trial in the task followed the same pattern and timing as described in study 1. A no-go trial in study 2 followed this sequence: the photo was presented within the white frame for 200 ms. The arrow then appeared superimposed on the top of the photo for a variable SSD, after which the frame turned red. The frame remained red for the period of time necessary for the total amount of time the arrow was displayed to equal 750 ms. For example, if the SSD was 250 ms, the red frame was displayed for 500 ms. Finally, the arrow and photo disappeared for a jittered intertrial period. \n\n\n\n### Self-Report Measures \n  \nTo measure internalizing and externalizing symptoms, adolescents in study 2 completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ;  ). Internalizing symptoms were measured using the Emotional and Peer Problems subscales and externalizing symptoms were measured using the Behavioral and Hyperactivity subscales. For each measure, the combination of the two subscales created a second-order factor that measures broad internalizing or externalizing symptoms, especially for low-risk, non-clinical youth samples ( ). Adolescents reported the extent to which the 10 items of internalizing symptoms (e.g., \u201cI am often unhappy, down-hearted or tearful\u201d) and 10 items of externalizing symptoms (e.g., \u201cI am often restless, overactive, cannot stay still for long\u201d) were true of them. Participants use a 3-point Likert scale (0 =   Not True   to 2 =   Certainly True  ). Scores were calculated as the sum of the 10 items for each measure (\u03b1 = 0.64 for internalizing, \u03b1 = 0.75 for externalizing). Mean scores in the current sample were 5.86 (SE = 0.47; median = 5; range = 1\u201314) for internalizing symptoms and 6.04 (SE = 0.54; median = 6; range = 0\u201314) for externalizing symptoms. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Acquisition \n  \nImaging data were collected using a 3 Tesla Siemens Magnetom Trio MRI scanner. The task consisted of T2 -weighted echoplanar images (EPI; 300 volumes; slice thickness = 3 mm; 38 slices; TR = 2 s; TE = 25 ms; matrix = 92 \u00d7 92; FOV = 230 mm; voxel size = 2.5 mm  \u00d7 2.5 mm  \u00d7 3 mm ). Structural scans, including a T1  magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE; 192 slices; TR = 1.9 s; TE = 2.32 ms; FOV = 230 mm; matrix = 256 \u00d7 256; sagittal acquisition plane; slice thickness = 0.9 mm) and a T2 -weighted, matched-bandwidth (MBW), high resolution anatomical scan (38 slices; TR = 4 s; TE = 64 ms; FOV = 230 mm; matrix = 192 \u00d7 192; slice thickness = 3 mm) were also acquired. To maximize brain coverage and reduce drop-out in orbital and temporal regions, MBW and EPI images were acquired at an oblique axial orientation. \n\n#### fMRI Data Preprocessing and Analysis \n  \nPreprocessing steps, utilizing FSL FMRIBs Software Library (FSL v6.0 ), included the following: skull stripping of all images using BET; slice-to-slice motion correction of EPI images using MCFLIRT; sequential co-registration of EPI images to standard stereotactic space defined by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and the International Consortium for Brain Mapping through the MBW and MPRAGE images using FLIRT; application of a 128 s high-pass temporal filter to remove low frequency drift within the time-series; and spatial smoothing with a 6 mm Gaussian kernel, full-width-at-half maximum. Individual-level independent component analysis (ICA) using MELODIC was applied and combined with an automated component classifier ( ; Neyman-Pearson threshold = 0.3) in order to remove artifact signal (e.g., physiological noise, motion) from the functional data. Quality check during preprocessing and analyses ensured adequate signal coverage in our sample. \n\nThe task was modeled using an event-related design within the Statistical Parametric Mapping software package (SPM8; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom). Each event was modeled using the onset of the stimulus and a duration equal to the participants\u2019 response time (or 750 ms on trials where participants did not respond). Individual fixed-effects models were created for each participant using the general linear model in SPM with regressors for conditions of interest: trials during each emotion block (e.g., neutral, happy, and angry). Consistent with prior work ( ;  ), all trials were modeled within a single regressor for a given block of the task, regardless of outcome, in order to capture the neural correlates involved in processing social rewards and social threats. Volumes containing motion in excess of 2 mm slice-to-slice were modeled in a separate junk regressor. However, if the number of volumes that exceeded the threshold was greater than 10% of the total number of trials, then the participant was excluded from the analyses. Jittered inter-trial periods (e.g., fixation) were not explicitly modeled and therefore serve as the implicit baseline for task conditions. \n\nWe conducted psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses using a generalized form of context-dependent PPI from the automated generalized PPI (gPPI) toolbox in SPM ( ). In order to examine amygdala-striatum functional connectivity, we used the bilateral ventral striatum as our seed region, which was defined structurally from WFU pickatlas ( ) using the AAL atlas ( ) with the following restrictions: \u221212 <   x   < 12, 4 <   y   < 8, \u221212 <   z   < 0. Time series were extracted from the VS seed region and served as the physiological variable. Each block of trials was then convolved with the canonical HRF to create the psychological regressor. In the final step, the physiological and psychological variables were multiplied in order to create the PPI term. This interaction term was then used to identify regions that covary with the ventral striatum seed region in a task-dependent manner. As such, each participant\u2019s individual gPPI model included a deconvolved BOLD signal alongside the psychological and interaction term for each event type. \n\nRandom effects, group-level analyses were run using GLMFlex . GLMFlex offers several advantages, including removing outliers and sudden activation changes in brain, corrects for variance-covariance inequality, partitions error terms, and analyzes all voxels containing data. Group-level analyses were performed by entering the number of false alarms committed by participants and self-reported internalizing/externalizing symptoms as continuous covariates in a series of whole-brain regressions, first testing for associations with neural activation followed by our key analysis on analyses on amygdala-VS functional connectivity. \n\nMonte Carlo simulations were used to compute a cluster corrected threshold using the updated (April, 2016) 3dFWHMx and 3dClustSim programs from the AFNI software package ( ) and the group-level brain mask for the analyses of interest. Simulations resulted in a voxel-wise threshold of   p   < 0.005 and a minimum cluster size ranging between 117 and 380 voxels for the whole-brain, corresponding to   p   < 0.05, family-wise error (FWE) corrected. For our   a priori   analyses focused on amygdala-VS connectivity, we utilized a small-volume correction, computing a cluster corrected threshold within a structurally defined amygdala mask from the AAL atlas. Simulations resulted in a voxel-wise threshold of   p   < 0.005 and a minimum cluster size of 3 voxels within the amygdala, corresponding to   p   < 0.05 small volume corrected. All reported results are available on NeuroVault  ( ). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \n#### False Alarm Rates to Social Rewards and Threats, Study 1 \n  \nTo test for age differences in false alarm rates across happy, angry, and neutral blocks, we conducted a repeated measures analysis of variance with one within subject variable (condition: happy, angry, and neutral) and one between subject variable (age group: adolescents, adults). Results revealed a significant main effect of condition,   F  (2,204) = 6.43,   p   = 0.002, \u03b7  = 0.059 and group,   F  (1,102) = 13.47,   p   < 0.0001, \u03b7  = 0.117 which was qualified by an age x condition interaction,   F  (2,204) = 6.60,   p   = 0.002, \u03b7  = 0.061. To probe this interaction, we conducted paired samples   t  -tests within each age group. As shown in  , adolescents showed more false alarms to happy [  t  (52) = 4.37,   p   < 0.0001,   d   = 0.54] and angry faces [  t  (52) = 2.63,   p   = 0.01,   d   = 0.32] than neutral faces, and more false alarms to happy than angry faces [  t  (52) = 2.39,   p   = 0.02,   d   = 0.27]. Adults did not show any significant differences across conditions. Next, we conducted independent samples   t  -tests across the 2 age groups. Adolescents showed more false alarms than adults to happy [  t  (102) = 4.31,   p   < 0.0001] and angry faces [  t  (102) = 2.78,   p   = 0.007] but did not differ significantly to neutral faces [  t  (102) = 1.8,   p   = 0.074]. \n  \nBehavioral effects on the social stop signal task. Adolescents had greater inhibitory failures to social reward and threat cues than to neutral cues, and more so to social reward than threat cues. \n  \n\n#### False Alarm Rates to Social Rewards and Threats, Study 2 \n  \nWe conducted a repeated measures analysis of variance with one within subject variable (condition: happy, angry, and neutral) to examine differences in false alarm rates across conditions in the adolescent sample. We found a significant effect of condition,   F  (2,116) = 3.4,   p   = 0.036, \u03b7  = 0.056.   Post hoc  , paired samples   t  -tests corroborated the findings from study 1 and our prior work ( ), such that adolescents made significantly more false alarms to happy (  M   = 19.29%, SE = 0.91%) compared to angry faces (  M   = 17.46%, SE = 0.91%; [  t  (58) = 2.71,   p   = 0.009,   d   = 0.26)]. However, false alarm rates to happy and angry faces did not differ from neutral faces. The fMRI version of the task includes the SSD, which adapts to participants\u2019 behavior ensuring participants perform at a more fixed rate across the task, and so false alarm differences are harder to identify. It is thus not surprising that our behavioral effects are weaker, but it is nonetheless impressive that they still emerged in the expected direction. \n\n\n#### False Alarm Rates to Social Rewards and Threats and Links to Internalizing and Externalizing Symptoms \n  \nTo understand links between disinhibition to social rewards and psychopathology, we examined the relationship between disinhibition to social rewards relative to social threats and internalizing symptoms in adolescents. We calculated a difference score for false alarm rates by subtracting false alarms rates to angry faces from happy faces, where higher scores indicate adolescents make more false alarms to social rewards. Adolescents who had greater false alarm rates to happy relative to angry faces reported greater internalizing symptoms [  r  (50) = 0.33,   p < 0  .05]. There was no significant correlation between false alarm rate to happy relative to angry faces and externalizing symptoms [  r  (50) = 0.12,   p =   0.39]. \n\n\n\n### fMRI Results \n  \n#### Main Effects of Social Rewards > Social Threats \n  \nGiven the heightened false alarm rates to happy relative to angry faces, we focused our analyses on this specific contrast. We first conducted a whole-brain   t  -test that compared happy and angry faces. Next, we investigated functional connectivity for this contrast. Results are shown in  . \n  \nBrain activation patterns for neural activation and functional connectivity. \n    \n\n#### Neural Correlates of False Alarm Rate to Social Rewards and Threats \n  \nNext, we examined how behavioral disinhibition relates to neural activation and amygdala-VS connectivity. Using the same behavioral metric as described above, we regressed the difference in false alarm rates (happy-angry) onto neural activation and neural connectivity for the contrast happy-angry. For neural activation, we found a bilateral amygdala cluster, such that adolescents with greater false alarms to social reward relatives to threat show less activation in bilateral amygdala to social rewards (see  ). \n\nFor neural connectivity, with the ventral striatum as the seed region, PPI analyses yielded coupling with the left amygdala that correlated with greater false alarm rates to happy faces (see   and  ). For descriptive purposes, we extracted parameter estimates of functional connectivity. As shown in  , adolescents who made more false alarms to happy relative to angry faces exhibited greater amygdala-VS connectivity to happy relative to angry faces. To further probe this effect, we examined how differences in false alarm rates are associated with neural connectivity to happy and angry faces separately (happy-neutral and angry-neutral). Using the ventral striatum as the seed region, PPI analyses demonstrated greater coupling with the left amygdala for happy relative to neutral cues that correlated with greater false alarm rates to happy faces. No significant correlation was found for angry relative to neutral cues (see  ). These findings suggest that failed inhibition to social rewards relative to threats may be facilitated amygdala-VS connectivity specifically to social reward cues. \n  \nPPI analysis with ventral striatum seed.   (A)   Adolescents with greater false alarm rate to social reward-social threat trials showed greater functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and amygdala (highlighted; MNI coordinates: x, y, z = \u201324, \u20134, \u201314) for social reward > social threat.   (B)   Parameter estimates of connectivity strength were extracted for descriptive purposes and plotted with false alarm rate. \n  \n\n#### Links to Internalizing and Externalizing Symptoms \n  \nWe examined how amygdala-VS connectivity is associated with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. First, we regressed internalizing symptoms onto neural activation and neural connectivity for the contrast happy-angry. For neural activation, no significant clusters were observed. For neural connectivity, using the ventral striatum as the seed region, the PPI analyses yielded coupling with the left amygdala that correlated with internalizing symptoms (see   and  ). This region is nearly identical to that found above for the connectivity analyses regressed with false alarm rate. For descriptive purposes, we extracted parameter estimates of functional connectivity. As shown in  , adolescents who showed greater connectivity to happy relative to angry faces reported greater internalizing symptoms. To further probe this effect, we examined how neural connectivity to happy and angry faces separately (happy-neutral and angry-neutral) relate to internalizing symptoms. Using the ventral striatum as the seed region, PPI analyses showed connectivity with the left amygdala for happy relative to neutral cues that correlated with internalizing symptoms. No significant correlation was found for angry relative to neutral cues. \n  \nPPI analysis with ventral striatum as seed.   (A)   Adolescents with higher internalizing symptoms showed greater functional connectivity between ventral striatum and amygdala (highlighted; MNI coordinates: x, y, z = \u201324, \u20136, \u201312) for social reward > social threat.   (B)   Parameter estimates of connectivity strength were extracted for descriptive purposes and plotted with internalizing symptom scores. \n  \nNext, we regressed externalizing symptoms onto neural activation and neural connectivity for the contrast happy-angry. Results for neural activation are shown in  . Furthermore, results for neural connectivity using the ventral striatum as the seed region did not yield coupling with the amygdala that correlated with externalizing symptoms (see  ). We therefore did not continue to analyze whether happy and angry faces separately (happy-neutral and angry-neutral) relate to externalizing symptoms. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAdolescents demonstrate a rise in sensitivity to socially affective cues such as social rewards ( ), which overlaps with a heightened risk for psychopathology such as internalizing and externalizing symptoms (e.g.,  ). The aim of the current study was to examine neural and behavioral dysregulation to social rewards and links to internalizing and externalizing symptoms in youths. Our results suggest that greater behavioral disinhibition to social reward cues (i.e., happy peer faces) than to social threat cues (i.e., angry peer faces) is associated with heightened amygdala-VS connectivity in adolescents. Moreover, greater internalizing, but not externalizing, symptoms were associated with greater behavioral disinhibition to social rewards as well as amygdala-VS connectivity. Together, these findings indicate that greater disinhibition to social rewards may render adolescents at greater risk for internalizing symptoms due to their shared amygdala-VS connectivity to social rewards relative to threats. \n\nBehaviorally, adolescents showed greater inhibitory failures in response to socially affective cues \u2013 both social reward and social threat cues \u2013 than to neutral cues, and even more so to reward than to threat cues. Moreover, there were age-related differences such that adolescents had greater inhibitory failures to socially affective cues than adults who performed relatively uniformly across these various cues. These behavioral findings align with previous research in that adolescents are particularly sensitive to socially appetitive cues such as social rewards ( ;  ), and extend this work by using peers\u2019 faces. Given the intensified reward sensitivity in adolescents ( ), it is plausible that adolescents demonstrate a stronger bias toward positive than negative cues, resulting in behavioral dysregulation in the presence of social rewards. Socially salient stimuli and information are especially relevant to adolescents, and ultimately shape their behavior ( ). Paying closer attention to social information at the cost of inhibitory failures may not necessarily be unfavorable to adolescents. Adolescence is a developmental period of social reformation where there are major changes in one\u2019s social network such as forming new, meaningful social connections. For instance, adolescents start to enter romantic relationships ( ), and non-parental figures or non-family members (e.g., teacher, coach) begin to serve pivotal roles ( ). Therefore, greater cognitive allocation to social information, such as positive social cues, may facilitate stronger social relationships in youths. \n\nHyper-sensitivity to socio-affective cues may come at a cost and ultimately place youth at risk for psychopathology. Indeed, greater inhibitory failures to social reward relative to social threat cues were associated with greater internalizing symptoms. Youths with greater internalizing symptoms, but not externalizing symptoms, tend to have better emotion comprehension such as understanding of others\u2019 emotions ( ). In a social context, adolescents with internalizing symptoms have better identification of happy than angry facial cues ( ) and have faster reaction times to happy than angry and fearful facial cues in Go/NoGo tasks ( ). This may imply that these youths at risk are particularly more sensitive to socially rewarding stimuli, which corroborate our finding of the relationship between behavioral disinhibition and internalizing symptoms. \n\nOur study did not find a significant link between disinhibition and externalizing symptoms. Previous research on disinhibition and externalizing symptoms in adolescents demonstrates conflicting results. That is, while some research has shown that youth with externalizing symptoms make more false alarms on Go/NoGo tasks ( ;  ), others have found that there is no relationship between externalizing symptoms such as impulsivity and false alarms on Go/NoGo tasks ( ;  ). To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the link between externalizing symptoms and behavioral disinhibition using salient peer faces in adolescents. It is possible that adolescents are just as impulsive to socially rewarding cues as they are to socially threatening cues. In other words, adolescents with symptoms of externalizing may be equally impulsive toward emotionally driven cues. However, given inconsistencies in results, further research is needed to better understand disinhibition in youths with symptoms of externalizing within a social context. \n\nAt the neural level, we found that adolescents who showed greater disinhibition to social reward cues demonstrated heightened connectivity between the amygdala and ventral striatum. Developmentally, connectivity between the two regions decreases from late childhood to early adolescence ( ), and continues to decrease in connectivity strength into early adulthood ( ). Importantly, our findings corroborate a prior study such that adolescents who showed greater behavioral disinhibition to socio-emotional cues demonstrated heightened amygdala-VS connectivity ( ). Greater connectivity between the amygdala and VS is thought to be a developmentally immature neural phenotype that emerges prior to the development of more mature top-down cortico-subcortical connectivity ( ). This hierarchical cascade of changes in connectivity patterns (i.e., from subcortico-subcortical connectivity in early adolescence to cortico-subcortical connectivity in late adolescence to cortico-cortical connectivity in adulthood) is proposed to be necessary for emotional brain development ( ). Together, our findings suggest that amygdala-VS connectivity, particularly in the context of social rewards, may represent a neural marker of emotion regulation difficulties. \n\nMoreover, greater amygdala-VS connectivity was associated with greater internalizing but not externalizing symptoms. This coupling may underline an \u201cunchecked\u201d subcortical system that is characteristic of behavioral dysregulation to social rewards and compromised psychological well-being. While prior studies have examined the relationship between behavioral dysregulation and internalizing symptoms, which underscores connectivity between the cognitive control and affective hubs (e.g.,  ;  ), our findings indicate that subcortico-subcortical connectivity, which is deemed to occur chronologically earlier and thus necessary for subcortico-cortical circuits ( ), and may serve as an early biomarker for emotion dysregulation and a risk factor for internalizing symptoms. Putting these studies together, it can be reconciled that social context and neurobiology are key contributors to internalizing symptoms in adolescents. \n\nThere are several limitations to our study. First, we only had fMRI data for adolescents and therefore do not know whether these neural patterns are age-specific. Future studies should consider incorporating children and adult comparison groups or utilize longitudinal methods to see how behavioral differences map onto neural differences across development. Second, we used a community sample of adolescents with self-reported internalizing symptoms. Given that these adolescents were not clinically diagnosed, our findings cannot be extended to the community of youths with clinically relevant mood disorders. Nonetheless, we assessed internalizing symptoms in a community sample, suggesting that our findings may be more applicable to adolescents who are classified as healthy, but are not clinically diagnosed. Last, the Emotional and Peer Problems subscale of SDQ cannot be separated into depression and anxiety symptoms, and thus the two cannot be examined in tandem. However, it may be parsimonious to create a composite of internalizing symptoms given that depressive and anxiety symptoms tend to load on a higher-order internalizing symptoms factor. Future research should utilize longitudinal methods to better unpack the cascade of developmental processes that occur at the level of brain connectivity, behavioral disinhibition, and the onset of psychopathology. \n\nIn conclusion, the current study corroborates and extends previous work to better understand the contextual effects of disinhibition to social rewards on adolescent well-being. Our findings suggest that greater behavioral disinhibition to social rewards are associated with stronger amygdala-VS connectivity, where amygdala and ventral striatum are classified as \u201chot\u201d affective nodes. Greater behavioral disinhibition and stronger amygdala-VS connectivity to social rewards are correlated with heightened internalizing symptoms, but not externalizing symptoms. Therefore, a greater orientation to social rewards may have implications for youth\u2019s mental health such as depression and anxiety. These behavioral effects were also age-specific to adolescents, thereby confirming that socially salient contexts such as social rewards are especially powerful to youths\u2019 motivations, behaviors, and psychological health. \n\n\n## Data Availability \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Institutional Review Board at the University of Illinois with written informed consent/assent from all subjects.

These networks are particularly vulnerable to age-related structural atrophy and an associated loss of executive function, yet existing evidence suggests preserved emotion processing ability in ageing. Using longitudinally acquired data from a battery of cognitive tasks, we defined a metric for the rate of decline of executive function. With this metric, we investigated relationships between changes in executive function and emotion reappraisal ability and brain structure, in 34 older adults, using functional and structural MRI. During task-based fMRI, participants were asked to cognitively reappraise negatively valenced images. We hypothesised one of two associations with decreasing executive function over time: 1) a decreased ability to reappraise reflected in decreased PFC and increased amygdala activation, or 2) a neural compensation mechanism characterised by increased PFC activation but no differential amygdala activation. Structurally, for a decreased reappraisal ability, we predicted a decrease in grey matter in PFC and/or a decrease of white matter integrity in amygdala-PFC pathways. Neither of the two hypotheses relating to brain function were completely supported, with the findings indicating a steeper decline in executive function associated with both increased PFC and increased left amygdala activity when reappraising negative stimuli. In addition, white matter integrity of the uncinate fasciculus, a primary white matter tract connecting the amygdala and ventromedial areas of PFC, was lower in those individuals who demonstrated a greater decrease in executive function. These findings highlight the association of diminishing cognitive ability with brain structure and function linked to emotion regulation. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAgeing is characterised by marked neural changes in the brain, with direct consequences for mental functioning and wellbeing. These changes include a spatially heterogeneous loss of grey matter and a reduction in white matter integrity, where age-related atrophy is more pronounced in areas such as the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex ( ;  ). Such age-related neural changes have been associated with impairments in memory and \u201cexecutive function\u201d (e.g. selective attention, switching, inhibition of irrelevant information;  ;  ;  ). These brain regions susceptible to age-related atrophy overlap with brain networks supporting successful regulation of emotion (for a review, see  ). \n\nThe ability to adaptively respond to negative situations is crucial for maintaining mental and physical health. Impaired regulation of emotion due to brain atrophy could render older adults particularly vulnerable to mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Given the overlap in neural networks involved in executive function and emotion regulation, and patterns of age-related brain atrophy, the notion that executive function and emotion regulation are interlinked and should both decline with age is compelling (e.g.  ). Yet, behavioural studies suggest improved emotion regulatory function with advancing age, possibly due to a reduced need for cognitive effort to achieve a regulatory goal in older age ( ). A number of factors have been suggested to contribute to this apparent paradox, including the use of different regulation strategies with advancing age ( ). Faced with structural brain changes and a decline in executive function, how do older adults maintain emotion regulatory function? \n\n### The emotion regulation network \n  \nAnimal and human research ( ;  ;  ) has demonstrated bidirectional anatomical connections between the amygdala (a subcortical structure that plays a key role in the acquisition and expression of emotion) and medial and orbital areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (which are important for higher order cognition and flexible value assignment respectively). The connection between these regions is considered instrumental in adaptive responding to emotional situations ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Using a paradigm of voluntary emotion regulation, human neuroimaging studies have identified a larger distributed network of prefrontal-amygdala brain regions subserving emotion regulation ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). These regions include the amygdala and ventromedial PFC as mentioned, but also involve lateral and dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) (for a recent meta-analysis see  ). Given the role of lateral PFC in maintaining representations and adjusting implementations, and DMPFC in self-referential processing and performance monitoring, these areas are thought to regulate negative emotion through cognitive reconstrual, or \u201creappraisal\u201d of the emotion-eliciting stimulus (e.g.  ). \n\nMost prior studies have identified increased PFC and decreased amygdala activation when participants reappraise negative stimuli with the goal to reduce negative affect, with a key role for the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in reappraisal success ( ). Furthermore, work from our group has demonstrated that the ventromedial PFC (VMPFC) mediates the inverse association between left VLPFC and amygdala in non-depressed adults ( ) and between DMPFC and amygdala in healthy older adults ( ) when reappraising negative stimuli. \n\n\n### Emotion regulation in the ageing brain \n  \nA few recent studies have examined functioning of this emotion regulatory network in healthy younger and older adults.   report lower left VLPFC and, at trend, DMPFC regulation-related activation (increase & decrease > control condition) in older compared to younger adults, but no differential age effect in amygdala activation. Using a similar voluntary emotion regulation task,   have also demonstrated lower activation for older compared to younger adults in left VLPFC but, again, no age difference in subcortical regions such as the amygdala. However, the same study showed that age-independent higher cognitive function, as measured using a composite score based on tasks designed to assess memory and executive function, is associated with a greater decrease in amygdala activation. In summary, these findings demonstrate that emotion regulation-associated PFC activation changes with age, and cognitive ability is an important indicator of emotion regulation outcome and is reflected in amygdala activity. \n\n\n### Structural and functional changes in the ageing brain \n  \nA common view is that age-related changes in brain function are caused, at least in part, by structural changes in the brain. This view is supported by evidence relating structural brain changes to behavioural outcomes ( ;  ;  ). Yet, only few studies have directly examined relationships between brain structure, function and cognitive decline. While some recent reports suggest a relationship between grey matter atrophy and cognitive decline ( ;  ), the overall body of evidence has been weak ( ). Studies incorporating measures of grey matter density and cognitive brain function in older adults reveal conflicting results. One study has found higher activation associated with higher grey matter density ( ), while other studies have shown higher activation associated with   lower   grey matter density ( ). A further study found a positive association between grey matter volume and activation, but no age association ( ). Our work on emotional processing in older age found a compensatory \u201cshift\u201d in engagement from lateral to medial PFC regions that was associated with grey matter loss in lateral PFC and age ( ). \n\nOther research suggests that variability in white matter, rather than grey matter, is more likely coupled to cognitive functioning in older adults, with stronger associations between executive function scores and white matter integrity than cortical thickness ( ). A recent longitudinal study extended these findings by demonstrating increased activity in lateral frontal cortex during task switching associated with a decline in white matter integrity in tracts connecting PFC regions ( ). \n\nIn summary, multimodal brain imaging studies that integrate structural brain changes and the effects of such changes on brain function are sparse, and hitherto non-existent in the field of emotion regulation. \n\n\n### The overlap between emotion regulation and executive function \n  \nEven at the behavioural level, only recently have researchers begun to examine executive function performance alongside emotion regulation in ageing (e.g.  ;  ). These findings suggest that aspects of executive function, such as verbal fluency, predict emotion regulatory ability in older adults. Yet, other research points at a general association between \u201cfluid\u201d cognitive abilities, including working memory and processing speed, and emotion regulation, in the absence of an effect of age group ( ). This is despite older adults showing lower fluid cognitive abilities compared to younger adults. \n\nThe reliance on comparison between younger and older adult groups, where between-group difference is assumed to be a proxy measure of ageing and/or cognitive decline, has hampered the majority of past research on emotion regulation and ageing. We argue that cohort effects or a lifetime's experience with emotional situations may be confounded with age. Furthermore, such between-group analyses will not adequately account for variation in, or preservation of, cognitive ability in the older age group. Therefore, we propose to examine associations between cognitive ageing and emotion regulation by focusing on change in executive function   within   a middle-to-older age group, taking advantage of longitudinal behavioural data to measure the rate of decline of cognitive ability for each participant. \n\n\n### Aims and predictions \n  \nThe aim of the present study is to test the relationship between executive function, brain structure, and emotion regulation-related brain function in older adults, by examining associations between a longitudinal measure of executive function and functional and structural MRI. We hypothesized that the rate of change of longitudinal executive function (rLEF), over and above any age or cross-sectional EF performance differences, would predict activity in regions of the brain instrumentally associated with emotion regulation (VMPFC, VLPFC and amygdala specifically), as well as structural brain integrity in this network. Specifically, we hypothesized one of two functional associations with decreasing longitudinal executive function: either a decreased ability in emotion downregulation reflected in decreased prefrontal cortical (PFC) activation and increased amygdala activation, or a compensatory effect with increased VMPFC activation but no differential amygdala effect (cf.  ). Although a number of regions of the PFC have been shown to be associated with emotion reappraisal, to avoid multiple tests, we chose to focus on regions of interest in the VMPFC and VLPFC, based on previous work in our lab (e.g.  ) and based on age-related shift observed in the   study. A whole-brain analysis will complement this ROI analysis for completeness, and to explore the specificity of the effects in other (PFC) areas known to be involved in emotion regulation. Structurally, we predicted a decrease in grey and/or white matter integrity of amygdala-prefrontal cortical pathways that would mediate the functional response of the amygdala and PFC. \n\n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \n36 older-aged participants (aged 56\u201383, M age\u00a0=\u00a073.2, SD\u00a0=\u00a06.7, 20 (55.6%) female) were included in this study. This group was derived from a larger cohort of 70 older adults recruited from the Reading University Older Adult Research Panel, via local newspaper and poster advertisements, and 20 younger adults also recruited via advertisements. We included all older adult participants for whom we had longitudinal cognitive data; that being at least two measures of executive function spaced at least two years apart. Participants scored between 23 and 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE, see   for details on standard neuropsychological test performance at the time of testing). No participants reported a history of neurological disorders or current use of steroid medication. All participants were right-handed. Participants were also screened for contraindication to MR scanning. Two male participants did not complete MR scanning and are not included in the analysis, leaving an N of 34 (see  ). This study was carried out in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki (1991, p. 1194). All procedures were approved by the NHS Research Ethics Service and the University of Reading's Research Ethics Committee. Participants provided written informed consent prior to their participation.   \nDescriptive statistics from the final sample and cognitive tasks. \n  Table 1   \n\n\n### Stimuli and tasks \n  \n#### Stimuli \n  \n96 images were selected from the International Affective Picture System ( ). Images were selected based on the normative valence ratings and categorised as either negative (76 images, valence\u00a0=\u00a01.46\u20133.85,   M  \u00a0=\u00a02.41, SD\u00a0=\u00a00.57) or neutral (24 images, valence\u00a0=\u00a04.38\u20135.88,   M  \u00a0=\u00a05.10, SD\u00a0=\u00a00.36). Picture categories were matched on luminosity, complexity and social content. \n\n\n#### Emotion regulation task \n  \nThe voluntary emotion regulation task comprised the reinterpretation of negative events, such as scenes depicted in images or movie clips, to lessen or intensify an emotional response. Similar forms of the task have been previously used with studies involving older adults ( ;  ). To induce negative affect prior to regulation, participants viewed each picture for three seconds after which they were presented with an audio instruction to \u201csuppress\u201d (decrease), \u201cenhance\u201d (increase), or \u201cmaintain\u201d (attend). Upon hearing \u201csuppress\u201d participants were asked to consider a less negative outcome of the scenario than they had thought prior to the instruction. For \u201cenhance\u201d they were asked to consider a more negative outcome, and for \u201cmaintain\u201d they were asked to keep their original impression in mind. Participants were asked to keep following the instruction until the image disappeared after a further six seconds. Participants received training and practice on the task immediately prior to scanning.  Example regulation strategies were suggested, e.g. for a picture of an injured animal to \u201cenhance\u201d their response they might consider the animal will die, or to \u201csuppress\u201d they might consider the animal will recover. Participants then practiced the task on five scenarios and were asked what strategy they used to follow the instruction. Training and practice was repeated if participants did not report the use of emotion regulatory strategies as intended. \n\nFollowing the picture, a ratings screen was presented for two seconds, during which participants were asked to rate the prior image as neutral, somewhat negative, quite negative, or very negative. The 96 trials involved a pseudo-randomised presentation of picture-instruction combinations. All neutral pictures were accompanied by the \u201cmaintain\u201d instruction. \n\nThe protocol was divided into four blocks, between which the participant was allowed to rest before commencing the next block. Inter trial interval was jittered, and each block lasted for a duration of approximately seven minutes. \n\n\n#### Stimulus presentation \n  \nStimuli were coded and presented using E-Prime (version 2.0.10.242, Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and delivered via VisualSystem binoculars (VisualSystem, NordicNeuroLab, Bergen, Norway). The VisualSystem binoculars were also used to monitor the participant's eye movements (eye movement data were not further analysed) and state of alertness throughout the experiment. Response to the ratings screen was recorded using a four-button MR-compatible button box held in the participant's right hand. \n\n\n#### Cognitive tasks \n  \nAs part of the Older Adult Research Panel, participants are invited to perform a battery of cognitive tests upon intake, and again every two years thereafter. Where participants had not been (re)tested within two years prior to the scan date, they were asked to resit the test battery as part of their participation of this study. For four participants, the resit data for the executive function tests was not successfully collected (see supplementary material for further details). Tests included, amongst others, verbal fluency ( ) and trail making tests ( ). The verbal fluency test included a letter and a semantic/category component. Participants were asked to name out loud as many words as possible in one minute starting with the letter F and then name as many animals as possible in one minute. The session was recorded and the experimenter counted the number of correct words, ignoring duplicates. For the trail making test, participants were tasked with drawing a line as quickly as possible to connect the elements in a sequence, initially with one category (numbers) and then with two alternating categories (numbers and letters). The time for both tasks was recorded and scores were obtained by dividing time (number and letters) / time (numbers). \n\nOther tests that were part of the Older Adult Research Panel test battery were collected but were not included in the composite score due to a lack of compatible historical data (e.g. switching from paper-and-pencil based tasks to computerised tasks, such as for the Stroop task), and are not reported here. \n\n\n\n### Data reduction and analysis \n  \n#### Executive function data reduction \n  \nLongitudinal data from verbal fluency: category  and trail-making tasks were used to calculate a longitudinal measure of the rate of change of executive function (rLEF) for each older adult, whereby the most negative rLEF score indicates the steepest decline in performance. For each participant, each set of data points included information of time since initial test in years (with the first test being at time point zero). A linear regression was used to calculate slope (i.e. the rate of change). Of the 34 participants, 11 had two timepoints, 14 had three, and 9 had four. The mean slope of verbal fluency was 0.16 (std dev\u00a0=\u00a01.01) and trail making was \u22120.03 (std dev.\u00a0=\u00a00.144) (see supplementary material for further details). To assess specificity for longitudinal, rather than cross-sectional EF performance, we equally computed a composite score across the raw scores of these two tasks acquired in the last session prior to scanning. \n\n\n#### MRI data acquisition \n  \nMRI data was collected using a 3T Siemens Magnetom scanner and 12-channel head coil (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) at the University of Reading Functional Imaging Facility. A 3D-structral MRI was acquired for each participant using a T1-weighted sequence (Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (MPRAGE), repetition time (TR)\u00a0=\u00a02020\u00a0ms, echo time (TE)\u00a0=\u00a03.02\u00a0ms, inversion time (TI)\u00a0=\u00a0900\u00a0ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a09\u00b0, field of view (FOV)\u00a0=\u00a0250\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0250\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0192\u00a0mm, resolution\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm isotropic, acceleration factor\u00a0=\u00a02, averages\u00a0=\u00a02, acquisition time\u00a0=\u00a09\u00a0min 7\u00a0s). Emotion regulation task-related fMRI data was collected in four identical blocks, using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence (211 whole-brain volumes, 30 sagittal slices, slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a03.0\u00a0mm, slice gap\u00a0=\u00a033%, TR\u00a0=\u00a02000\u00a0ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0, FOV\u00a0=\u00a0192\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0192 mm , resolution\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0mm isotropic, acquisition time\u00a0=\u00a07\u00a0min 10\u00a0s per block). Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were collected with an EPI sequence (50 sagittal slices, slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a02.0\u00a0mm, TR\u00a0=\u00a06800\u00a0ms, TE\u00a0=\u00a093\u00a0ms, resolution\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0mm isotropic, averages =2, acquisition time\u00a0=\u00a07\u00a0min 24\u00a0s). Diffusion weighting was distributed along 30 directions with a   b   value of 1000s/mm . For each diffusion set, one volume with a   b   value of 0\u00a0s/mm  was also acquired. Further structural and functional MRI data were acquired as part of this protocol but are not reported here. \n\n\n#### FMRI preprocessing and registration \n  \nPreprocessing and statistical analysis of MR data was carried out in FSL 5.0.7 (FMRIB's Software Library,  ;  ;  ). Subject FMRI data were field-map corrected to adjust for distortions due to magnetic field inhomogeneity, spatially realigned to correct for head motion, slice-time corrected, normalized to MNI space via coregistration to the subject T1-weighted image, and smoothed using a Gaussian 6\u00a0mm FWHM kernel. \n\n\n#### FMRI analyses \n  \nData were modelled at block level with three explanatory variables (EVs) used to describe the instruction conditions (\u201csuppress\u201d, \u201cenhance\u201d, \u201cmaintain\u201d) with negative pictures, and one EV for the \u201cmaintain\u201d instruction with neutral pictures. A further EV, used to model the valence judgement, and six motion correction EVs were included as covariates of no interest. At the intermediate level, mean effect for each condition was determined in a fixed effects model across the four blocks. At the final level, GLM analysis consisted of regressors for rLEF, cross-sectional EF, and age  using FSL's Randomise with threshold free cluster enhancement estimated from 5000 permutation samples per independent test. All significant statistical analyses are reported for   p   < .05, familywise error (FWE) corrected. \n\nPre-defined anatomical masks were created for bilateral amygdala and VLPFC (Harvard-Oxford atlas,  ), as well as VMPFC (McGill,  ) using a 50% probability threshold. These masks were used for small volume correction of the voxel-wise search in those regions. Contrasts of negative/suppress vs negative/maintain (suppress vs maintain), and negative/enhance vs negative/maintain (enhance vs maintain) were assessed with age and rLEF as regressors. Results are reported with peak MNI coordinates, number of voxels, and max Z. \n\n\n#### Grey matter probability (GMP) \n  \nSimilar to the methods reported in  , we used FSL's FAST algorithm ( ) to segment the high resolution T1-weighted image into grey matter, white matter, and CSF. We then normalised and blurred the GMP maps to the same extent as the functional data of interest. Cluster-wise GMP was extracted using the statistical ROIs from the FMRI regression analysis and associations between GMP and functional data (residualised for age and cross-sectional EF performance, per the performed voxel-wise search with rLEF), were assessed using Pearson correlations, with an alpha level of   p   < .05. \n\n\n#### DWI preprocessing, registration, and analyses \n  \nDiffusion weighted data were corrected for subject head motion and the effects of eddy currents. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were produced by fitting calculated tensor values to the data. Analysis of FA data was performed using FSL's tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) method. This involves the removal of the most distal voxels to remove likely outliers, nonlinear registration of subject data to a study-specific template and affine alignment to the MNI152 T1-weighted template. All subject data were used to determine the mean white matter FA skeleton, which was thresholded at a factor of 0.2. A mask of this skeleton was created to define the extent of the voxelwise analysis of FA data. Anatomical masks of the left and right uncinate fasciculus, forceps minor and corticospinal tract were used for region of interest analysis. These masks were taken from the JHU-ICBM-DTI probabilistic atlas ( ) thresholded at 0.25. The forceps minor and corticospinal tract served as control regions, similar to previous structure-function research ( ). We used rLEF as a predictor variable of white matter integrity as measured by tract-based fractional anisotropy. Age and cross-sectional EF were included in the model as covariates. Statistical analyses of FA data were performed using FSL's Randomise with threshold-free cluster enhancement estimated from 5000 permutation samples per independent test. All significant statistical analyses are reported for   p   < .05, familywise error (FWE) corrected. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Effects of longitudinal change in executive function on brain activation in an emotion regulation task \n  \nAssociations between rLEF and contrasts of activation were assessed. We focused our analyses on a-priori regions of interest in PFC (VLPFC and VMPFC) and amygdala, based on their association with emotion regulation. For completeness, whole-brain results outside of these a-priori ROIs are also reported (see   and  ).   \nA-priori PFC and amygdala regional activation patterns in response to stimuli presented in the emotion regulation task. \n  Table 2       \nWhole-brain activation patterns in response to stimuli presented in the emotion regulation task. \n  Table 3     \n\nTo test for either a decreased ability in emotion regulation (reflected in decreased PFC and increased amygdala activation during reappraisal), or a compensatory effect (increased PFC activation but no change in amygdala), we first regressed rLEF against the activation contrast of suppress vs maintain. rLEF correlated negatively with the suppress vs. maintain activation contrast in both PFC regions of interest; VMPFC, and left VLPFC, as well as bilateral amygdala (see  ,   and  ). In other words, greater activation in these regions to suppress vs maintain was associated with a higher rate of EF decline. In the whole brain analysis, negative correlations between rLEF and the suppress vs maintain activation contrast were also observed in the bilateral insula, bilateral post-/pre-central gyrus, bilateral intracalerine cortex/precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus and paracingulate/anterior cingulate gyrus, among others (see  ). There were no significant correlations of rLEF with the enhance vs maintain contrast in a-priori regions, nor in the whole brain analysis.   \nSignificant correlations for the contrast of suppress vs maintain associated with rLEF, at ROI (red) corrected level of significance thresholding.

All VIFs were sufficiently low (age=1.08, EF=1.32, rLEF=1.29) to allow the assumption that multicollinearity can be safely ignored. Relatedly, there were neither ROI nor whole brain associations with age or cross-sectional cognitive performance for the suppress vs maintain contrast or for the enhance vs maintain contrast. To address the possibility of cognitive impairment as a confound, analyses were rerun excluding the seven participants who scored lower than 26 on the MMSE test (three at 25, one at 24, and three at 23). Results demonstrated good coherence with those from the full cohort (see Supplementary Material,  ). \n\n#### Main effects \n  \nFor main effects only, we found typical patterns of activation for the emotion regulation task in the a-priori regions of interest for suppress vs maintain (increased activation in bilateral VLPFC) and enhance vs maintain contrasts (increased activation in bilateral amygdala, bilateral VLPFC and VMPFC), and in the whole brain analysis (see   and  ). We did not find a main effect in amygdala for maintain vs suppress. \n\n\n\n### Grey and white matter integrity and associations with bold responses \n  \nResults from the task-based FMRI experiment demonstrated emotion regulation-based changes in activation associated with rLEF in, among others, left VLPFC, VMPFC and left amygdala. We assessed associations between the BOLD response in the PFC clusters and the GMP within and across these areas, to test the prediction that rLEF-related differences in BOLD response patterning would be associated with individual differences in PFC structural integrity (see   for findings suggesting some functional compensation for age-related grey matter loss). While there was a trend towards a negative correlation between the GMP in VMPFC and the BOLD response in left VLPFC for the suppress relative to the maintain condition, this correlation was not significant,   r  (32)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.29,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.10. None of the other correlations were significant (max   r  (32)\u00a0=\u00a00.20, all others   r   < 0.1). GMP in these prefrontal regions was also not correlated with rLEF, max   r  \u00a0=\u00a00.16,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.36. \n\nWe next assessed the integrity of the uncinate fasciculus, the primary white matter tract that connects the VMPFC and amygdala. We used rLEF as a predictor variable of white matter integrity as measured by tract-based fractional anisotropy. Age and cross-sectional EF ability were included in the model as covariates. Using the pre-defined left and right uncinate fasciculus masks as regions of interest, results showed a significant positive correlation between FA and rLEF in the left uncinate fasciculus (number of voxels\u00a0=\u00a040,   p   < .01, MNI coordinates: \u221230,8,\u22128), situated between the insula and putamen. A smaller region was also seen in right uncinate (number of voxels\u00a0=\u00a05,   p   < .07, MNI coordinates: 2,31,10) (See  ). FA values in the control regions (forceps minor and corticospinal tract) did not show any clusters of voxels significantly correlated with rLEF. Thus, greater structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus was specifically associated with maintenance of executive function over time.   \nSignificant negative correlations for rLEF with FA in the left (red) and right (green) uncinate fasiculus, controlling for age.

Furthermore, rLEF significantly mediated the association between FA in this cluster in the uncinate fasciculus tract and amygdala activation (Indirect effect size\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.76, SE\u00a0=\u00a00.32, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[\u22121.33, \u22120.11]. However, FA did not mediate the amygdala-rLEF association (Indirect effect size\u00a0=\u00a00.00, SE\u00a0=\u00a00.02, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[\u22120.04, 0.02]). Mediation analyses were performed using PROCESS (Hayes (2018)  ) implemented in SPSS v20. \n\n\n### Are the ratings predicted by rate of change in EF? \n  \nDuring the emotion regulation task, after each image, participants were asked to score the negativity of the image on a four-point scale, with 1 reflecting \u201cneutral\u201d and 4 \u201cvery negative\u201d. Reflecting the FMRI analytic approach, we assessed whether the negativity ratings for the pictures presented in the task differed as a function of regulation (enhance, attend, suppress) and rLEF. We also took age and cross-sectional EF ability (all continuous predictor variables were demeaned) into consideration in the MANCOVA model. The rate of change did not explain variance in the ratings, over and above age and cross-sectional EF performance,   F  \u00a0=\u00a00.67,   p =   .52,   n.s.   A main effect of regulation was found on unpleasantness ratings,   F  (2, 29)\u00a0=\u00a012.26,   p   <0.001. On average, rated negativity was higher for the \u201cenhance\u201d condition (  M  \u00a0=\u00a02.75,   SD  =0.40) compared to the \u201cmaintain\u201d condition (  M  \u00a0=\u00a02.51,   SD  =0.34). Unexpectedly, the \u201csuppress\u201d condition was associated with higher rated negativity of the images (  M  \u00a0=\u00a02.60,   SD  =0.37) compared to the maintain condition. With respect to cross-sectional EF and age, age interacted with regulation,   F  (2, 29)\u00a0=\u00a03.55,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.042. Follow-up comparisons to further investigate the age x regulation interaction was carried out by estimating the ratings means at +1 and \u22121 SD of the mean age respectively. Results suggested that \u201colder\u201d older adults provided more differential ratings of the images than the \u201cyounger\u201d older adults as a function of regulation condition, with both the \u201cenhance\u201d and \u201csuppress\u201d conditions resulting in higher negative ratings (  M  \u00a0=\u00a02.73 for enhance and   M  \u00a0=\u00a02.55 for suppress) than the \u201cmaintain\u201d conditions (  M  \u00a0=\u00a02.36,   p   < .001 and   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.006 resp.), and the negative ratings being higher in the enhance vs suppress condition (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.024). This effect was not significant for the \u201cyounger\u201d group (at \u22121 SD, with the multivariate   F  (2,29)=1.74,   p  =.192;   M   enhance\u00a0=\u00a02.78,   M   maintain\u00a0=\u00a02.65,   M   suppress\u00a0=\u00a02.66). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur findings demonstrate that, when decreasing negative emotion through reappraisal, activation in the fronto-limbic network is greater in individuals with a larger negative rate of change of executive function. More specifically, we found that a relative decline in EF predicted reduced downregulation of activity in left amygdala, despite recruitment of various PFC regions that are key in emotion regulation, including VMPFC and VLPFC (e.g.  ). Outside these a-priori regions of interest, a decline in EF was also associated with recruitment of other areas in (pre)frontal cortex including DLPFC, DMPFC, frontal pole, anterior cingulate and premotor and supplementary motor cortex, and areas in insula, pre/post central gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus. These regions have previously been reported to show activation differences in emotion regulation (see meta-analyses by  ) and  )). Additionally, the DMPFC had previously been highlighted, alongside VLPFC, as a brain region showing age-related activation differences when reappraising (increasing and decreasing) negative affect ( ). We did not find evidence of any prefrontal cortical regions with decreased engagement. \n\nThe association between the rate of change in EF and activation in these brain regions was specific to the decrease condition, as no significant associations were observed in the increase vs maintain contrast. Focusing on individual differences in integrity of the uncinate fasciculus, a white matter tract connecting amygdala with prefrontal cortical areas including VMPFC, we showed that a higher rate of decline of executive function was associated with decreased white matter integrity in left uncinate fasciculus and, at trend-level, also in right uncinate fasciculus. Grey matter probability in VMPFC and VLPFC areas demonstrating activation differences as a function of rLEF was not significantly associated with BOLD response, nor with rLEF. \n\nPrior brain imaging work on reappraisal-based emotion regulation has presented relatively few age-related differences in neural activity. Across two studies, reduced recruitment of left VLPFC was found for older compared to younger adults ( ;  ) but these studies found no age-related differences in other brain areas, including the amygdala. Furthermore, increased cognitive performance, including EF, has been shown to predict greater regulation-related decreases in amygdala activation ( ) and reappraisal success (modelled using a composite of self-report, physiological and expressive behaviour measurements,  )   regardless   of age. Our findings add to this knowledge base to suggest that, in older age, reappraisal is compromised not necessarily when age is high or EF is low, but when a given person's EF ability decreases over time. \n\nIn line with this suggestion, we found that the white matter integrity of a cluster in the left uncinate fasciculus, a primary pathway between VMPFC and amygdala, decreased with increasing rate of cognitive loss. This finding was specific to the uncinate fasciculus; no such correlations were observed in the control tracts. It may be the case that the loss of structural integrity in this tract means that the successful recruitment of key areas in the prefrontal cortex is not translated into a suppression of amygdala activity, although the direct relationship between higher uncinate fasciculus integrity and decreased bilateral amygdala activity when participants were reappraising the negative information showed only a trend-level correlation. There was however, a full mediation effect of longitudinal EF on this association, suggesting that longitudinal EF change carried the relationship between reappraisal-related amygdala activity and white matter integrity. Given that the clusters included in the mediation analysis were derived from a voxel-wise regression analysis with rLEF as the predictor variable, and that the association between amygdala and white matter integrity in the uncinate fasciculus was not strong, this is perhaps not surprising. Future research on structure-function relationships in ageing would benefit from data-driven approaches, such as those discussed by  , to further address how age-related structural loss affects brain function. Unlike prior findings suggesting functional compensation for age-related grey matter loss in left VLPFC during picture-induced negative affect ( ), we did not find any associations with grey matter probability and either rLEF or BOLD response in PFC regions in this study. Whilst interpreting a null finding is tricky, it could be that variability in grey matter in these PFC regions is more tightly coupled to age per se, and less to cognitive functioning in older age, per recent studies ( ;  ). \n\nLongitudinal change in EF was not only positively associated with the BOLD response to the suppress condition in a-priori prefrontal areas but demonstrated associations in a larger network of regions, including anterior cingulate cortex and insula, typically involved in salience/attentional control (see e.g.  ). Connectivity between salience and arousal networks has been shown to increase with heightened arousal ( ). We found a decline in EF related to increased engagement of these brain regions when decreasing negative affect. Prior work has demonstrated that cognitive ageing is often paired with increased activation and disrupted connectivity in similar cortical regions, often thought to underlie a compensation for loss of brain structure integrity (for a review, see  ). Our findings add to this literature by highlighting that it is not age per se, nor group-relative EF performance per se, but an age-related change in EF that may engage such compensatory mechanisms. In other words, an over recruitment occurs when individuals no longer function at the level that they were accustomed to. The specificity of the findings to the suppress (and not the enhance) condition further suggests that this condition is marked by individual differences specifically, a point made earlier by our group ( ) and others (for a review see  ). \n\nWith respect to the ratings of unpleasantness as a function of regulatory instruction, we found that the pictures were rated as more negative after both regulation instructions compared to the attend condition. The ratings did not vary as a function of longitudinal change in EF, over and above age and cross-sectional EF. We did find that older age within our sample was associated with higher ratings of picture unpleasantness, both after the instruction to increase and decrease their response to the pictures. Higher negative ratings after the instruction to decrease emotion have previously been reported in research involving older adults (e.g.  ) and the reason for this effect is not entirely clear. The effect could be due to different, and in general more, visual scanning of the pictures after receiving an instruction to regulate to generate a narrative serving reappraisal, interacting with the ratings provided of the picture, rather than the experience. Prior work involving older adults has identified that the instruction to reappraise with the goal to increase or decrease picture-induced negative affect was associated with a higher number of fixations and larger distances between fixations ( ). Increased scanning may have resulted in an increased intake of information, enhancing the negativity rating of the picture, irrespective of their experience of negative affect. Indeed, whilst we found on average increased left and right amygdala activation for the enhance condition, no such effect was found for the suppress condition (see  ). This finding has previously been reported, particularly in studies involving older adults and where instructions were delivered during, rather than prior to, picture presentation (e.g.  ,  ). The reason for asking about the rating of the picture rather than their experience was to counter any potential demand characteristics resulting from providing an explicit instruction. Future work should assess other, ideally implicit, indicators of emotional experience. \n\nGiven the limited literature on executive function and emotion regulation in the same older adult cohort, this work provides an important addition to understanding the interplay between executive function and emotion regulation in the ageing brain. As stated, some behavioural evidence suggests that markers of executive function are positively associated with emotion regulation ability in cross-sectional samples of older adults (e.g.  , ). We sought to expand on this evidence in two ways; firstly by focusing on a longitudinal measure of executive function to obtain each individual's rate of decline, and secondly by correlating this metric with structural and functional brain patterns supporting emotion regulation. We found that individuals showing the largest rate of decline also showed greater recruitment of the amygdala and areas in PFC when regulating emotion. These findings may suggest that there is a preservation of emotion regulation ability with age until executive function starts to decline. What remains to be explained, however, is why increased PFC activation was not paired with a decrease in amygdala activation in our study. Whilst requiring replication, our findings provide evidence of a more complex scenario whereby decline in white matter integrity inhibits successful regulation despite increased functional effort. \n\nIn conclusion, the findings presented here highlight that the rate of change of executive function, and not age or cognitive ability per se, impacts the ability to downregulate picture-induced negative affect despite increased cortical engagement. With respect to structure-function integration, findings suggest that the integrity of key white matter tracts supporting corticolimbic interaction, rather than grey matter atrophy, may impede downregulation of amygdala responsivity when the context requires one to do so. These findings have implications for our understanding of age-related cognitive decline and may be relevant for pathology associated with rapid cognitive decline (e.g. Alzheimer's, dementia). The ability to adaptively respond to negative situations is crucial for maintaining mental and physical health. Impaired regulation of emotion due to brain atrophy could render older adults particularly vulnerable to mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. \n\nFuture work should incorporate functional connectivity analyses or model trial-by-trial variability in reappraisal success to further understand which brain networks are crucially affected by age-related changes in executive function in downregulating the emotional response. Particularly when employed in longitudinal designs, such work can also serve to highlight any compensatory mechanisms that help maintain emotional resilience in older age. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe data that support the findings of this study are available via 10.18112/openneuro.ds002366.v1.0.0. \n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n William K.

More recently studies have shown that vicarious rewards elicit similar activation. Ventral striatum responses to rewards for self peak during adolescence. However, it is currently not well understood how ventral striatum responses to vicarious rewards develop. In this study, we test this question using behavioral and fMRI data. A total of 233 participants aged 9\u201326 years old played a gambling game in the scanner in which they could win or lose money for themselves, their best friend and mother. Participants rated how close they felt to their friend and mother and how much they liked winning for them. These ratings were positively correlated. On the neural level males showed higher responses to winning for a friend, but there were no age differences. In contrast, there was a quadratic effect of age when winning for mother, showing heightened ventral striatum activity in mid-adolescence. Furthermore, there was an interaction between age and sex; for females responses to winning for friends become stronger with age relative to winning for mothers. In conclusion, this study provided evidence for elevated ventral striatum responses for mothers in mid-adolescence, and a shift in ventral striatum responses towards peers in girls. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPrior neuroimaging studies have consistently demonstrated that experiencing rewards for self is associated with robust activity in the ventral striatum, specifically in the nucleus accumbens (Nacc) ( ) and that the strength of the neural response in ventral striatum is positively related to the subjective experience of the reward ( ). Adolescents show higher activity in the ventral striatum relative to children and adults when winning money for themselves ( ;  . However, adolescence is also a crucial time for social development. As adolescents assert greater independence from their parents, peers become an important social group. Adolescents form more complex friendships with their peers ( ). Especially relationships with best friends are found to be more intimate ( , positive and reciprocal ( ). How adolescents experience rewards for close others is not yet understood. \n\nThere is evidence that sharing feelings with friends or winning money for friends is associated with activity in the ventral striatum, also known as vicarious rewards. For example, adults show stronger activity in the ventral striatum both when they win money for themselves as well as when they win money for their friend, relative to someone they dislike ( ;  ) and these responses are moderated by relationship closeness ( ). A recent meta-analysis confirmed that receiving rewards for self is related to activation in the ventral striatum, but vicarious rewards for others were more strongly related to activation in prefrontal areas such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex ( ). Activity in the ventral striatum response is possibly dependent on experienced closeness with the beneficiary. An important question that remains unanswered is how responses to vicarious rewards in the ventral striatum for friends change over adolescent development. \n\nAnother important social context during adolescence is the parent\u2013child relationship. As adolescence gain independence and autonomy from their parents, this is often thought to lead to a decline in parent\u2013child closeness. Indeed, one study found that mother cohesion decreased between 9th and 12th grade and stabilized after 12th grade ( ). Even though adolescents become more independent, parents continue to provide an important social context and parent\u2013child relationships become more egalitarian as adolescents get older ( , b). A previous study investigating neural responses to donations to family members found that donating money to family members was associated with increased activity in the ventral striatum ( ). A longitudinal follow up showed that higher ventral striatum responses to family money donations were related to decreases in risk taking behavior 1 year later ( ). \n\nIn the current study, we test and compare responses to vicarious rewards for friends and parents using behavioral as well as neural measures. In this study mothers were chosen as beneficiary since mothers are most often indicated as primary parent ( ). To investigate how behavioral and neural measures develop over age we included children, adolescents and adults between the ages of 9 and 26 years. Participants played a well-validated reward task in which they could win and lose money for themselves, their best friend and their mother. In a previous study using the same paradigm, we found that ventral striatum responses showed a different pattern of results for friends and disliked others ( ), which indicates that this task is suitable to detect differences in neural responses to vicarious rewards for different beneficiaries. After the task, participants rated how much they liked to win for each of the beneficiaries. \n\nWe hypothesized that self-report relationship closeness with friends increases with age ( ) and that this would be mirrored by higher striatum responses to winning money for friends with age. For mother, we hypothesized that self-report relationship closeness decreases or remains stable over development and this would be mirrored by a decrease or no change in striatum responses over age for mothers. \n\nThere are indications that the experience of friendship and family cohesion differs for boys and girls. Girls are often thought to experience more intimate friendships. Girl dyads are characterized by self-disclosure, empathy and interdependence ( ;  ), whereas boy dyads have higher levels of negative interaction and issues of dominance occur more often ( ;  ). Furthermore, a prior study found that girls reported higher mother cohesion than boys ( ). Based on these prior studies, we predicted that, compared to males, females would report higher relationship quality for friends ( ;  ) and mothers ( ). We explored whether sex differences would also be present in vicarious rewards for friends and mothers. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were part of a large, longitudinal study called Braintime. Participants were scanned three times, with a 2-year interval. The current study reports only data from the second time point since participants played the gambling game for their mother only on this time point. Results from the self-condition reported in this study have previously been published separately as part of a longitudinal study ( ;  ;  ). \n\nData were used from participants who generated usable fMRI data. In total, 254 participants performed the fMRI session. Ten participants were excluded for moving more than 1 voxel. An additional eight participants were excluded for not finishing the task, technical problems and/or artifacts during data collection. An additional three participants were excluded since they could not play for their mother. The total number of participants for whom fMRI data was available was therefore 233 (117 females). Participants were aged between 9.9 years old and 26.6 years old (M = 16.1, SD = 3.7). Two subscales, picture completion and vocabulary, of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Adults (WAIS-III) or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) ( ) were used to determine an approximation of IQ. The estimated IQ scores fell within the high to normal range (M \u2009=\u2009108.2, SD \u2009=\u200910.46). Informed consent was obtained from adult participants and parental permission and minor assent was obtained for the children and adolescents. Participants were screened for MRI contra indications and were free of neurological and psychiatric disorders. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the university medical ethical committee. Participants received a compensation for their participation in a larger scale study (EUR 60 for adult, EUR 25 for participants aged 12\u201317 and EUR 20 for participants younger than 12). \n\n\n### Experimental task \n  \nParticipants played a heads or tails gambling game in which they could win or lose money ( ). On each trial, participants guessed whether the computer would pick heads or tails and they won when the computer selected the chosen side of the coin. Each trial started with a trial onset screen (4000\u2009ms) during which the participant indicated their choice to play for heads or tails. On the trial onset screen, the participants also saw how much they could win or lose on that trial, explained in more detail below. The trial onset screen was followed by a fixation screen (1000\u2009ms) and after that a feedback screen, which showed whether participants won or lost on that trial (1500\u2009ms). Trials ended with a variable jitter (M \u2009=\u20092298 ms, range 1000\u201313 200\u2009ms), see  . Trial sequence and timing was optimized using OptSeq ( ); see also ( ). The probability for winning was 50%. Three different distributions of coins were included; trials on which two coins could be won and five lost, trials on which three coins could be won or three lost and finally trials on which five coins could be won or two could be lost. These different distributions of coins were included to keep participants engaged in the task, but were not analyzed separately (see also  ). Participants were informed about the different distributions of coins and were familiarized with them during the practice task. Participants were explained that the coins won during the experiment translated to real money at the end of the experiment and that one of the beneficiaries would be randomly selected to receive the money. Participants received 4, 5 or 6\u2009euro\u2019s at the end of the task and they were asked to provide the beneficiary with this money if they did not win money for themselves. Unbeknownst to the participants, the total earnings on the task did not relate to the amount won during the task but were chosen at random. Participants played 30 trials in the gambling game for themselves, 30 trials for their best friend and 30 trials for their mother person. Trials were presented in random order. Best friends were same-sex peers and participants were asked to provide the name of their best friend before the experimental session.\n   \nExample of a trial. On stimulus onset participants were presented with a screen indicating how much they could win or lose and for whom they were playing on that trial. During this time, they chose to play for heads or tails by pressing the corresponding button. After 4000\u2009ms a fixation cross was presented for 1000\u2009ms, after which the outcome screen was presented for 1500\u2009ms. The outcome screen indicated how many coins the participant had won or lost and for whom. A trial ended with a fixation cross shown for a variable delay between 1000 and 13 200\u2009ms. \n  \n\n\n### Self-report measures \n  \n Subjective ratings.   After the scanning session participants indicated how much they liked it when they won for themselves and when their friend and mother won. Ratings were made on a 10-point scale ranging from (0) \u2018not at all\u2019 to (10) \u2018very much\u2019. The mean score for this rating was 7.6 (SD\u2009=\u20091.9; range\u2009=\u20091\u201310) for self, 7.3 (SD\u2009=\u20091.7; range\u2009=\u20091\u201310) for friend and 7.4 (SD\u2009=\u20091.8; range\u2009=\u20090\u201310) for mother. In total 231 participants provided ratings for how much they liked it when they won for themselves, 228 participants provided ratings for when their friend won and 224 participants provided ratings for how much they liked it when their mother won. Ratings for some participants were not recorded due to equipment problems. \n\n Inclusion of Other in Self Scale (IOS).   The IOS is a single item measure to assess relationship closeness ( ). Participants are presented with seven Venn diagrams with varying overlap. In each Venn diagram, one circle represents the participant, the other circle represents another person. Scores for the IOS range from one to seven, with one representing the lowest relationship closeness and seven the highest. The Inclusion of Other in Self scale has been used in other studies with an adolescent population starting at age 12 (see for instance  ). In the current study, participants filled out the IOS twice, once in which the other circle represented their best friend and once when the other circle represented their mother. Mean scores for experienced relationship closeness was 5.34 (SD\u2009=\u20091.31) for friend and 5.52 (SD\u2009=\u20091.63) for mother. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nParticipants received instructions regarding the testing session in a quiet laboratory room. Participants were familiarized with the MRI scanner with a mock scanner. Next the gambling game was explained and participants performed six practice trials. After the scanner session, WISC-III or WAIS-III were administered. Participants filled out the IOS and the ratings directly after the scan. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nScanning was performed on a 3 Tesla Philips scanner, with a standard whole-head coil. The functional scans were acquired using T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI; TR =\u20092.2\u2009s, TE =\u200930\u2009ms, sequential acquisition, 38 slices of 2.75\u2009mm, field of view 220\u2009mm, 80 \u00d7 80 matrix, in-plane resolution 2.75\u2009mm). The first two volumes were discarded to allow for equilibration of T1 saturation effects. After the functional runs, a high-resolution 3D T1-weighted anatomical image was collected (TR =\u20099.751\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20094.59\u2009ms, flip angle =\u20098\u00b0, 140 slices, 0.875 mm \u00d7 0.875 mm \u00d7 1.2 mm, and FOV\u2009=\u2009224 \u00d7 168 \u00d7 177). Visual stimuli were displayed on a screen in the magnet bore. A mirror attached to the head coil allowed participants to view the screen. Foam inserts inside the coil were used to limit head movement. \n\n\n### fMRI pre-processing \n  \nAll data were analyzed with SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London). Images were corrected for slice timing acquisition and differences in rigid body motion. Structural and functional volumes were spatially normalized to T1 templates. Translational movement parameters never exceeded 1 voxel (<3\u2009mm) in any direction for any participant or scan. The normalization algorithm used a 12-parameter affine transform together with a nonlinear transformation involving cosine basis functions and resampled the volumes to 3 mm cubic voxels. Templates were based on the MNI305 stereotaxic space ( ). Functional volumes were spatially smoothed with a 6\u2009mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel. Statistical analyses were performed on individual subjects data using the general linear model in SPM8. The fMRI time series were modeled as a series of zero duration events convolved with the hemodynamic response function (HRF). On trial onset events were modeled separately for playing for self, friend and mother. On feedback onset winning and losing for self, friend and mother were modeled. This resulted in three conditions at trial onset (self, friend, mother) and six conditions at feedback onset (self win, self lose, friend win, friend lose, mother win, mother lose). Trials on which the participants failed to respond were modeled separately as covariate of no interest and were excluded from further analyses. The modeled events were used as regressors in a general linear model, along with a basic set of cosine functions that high-pass filtered the data (cut off 120), and a covariate for session effects. The least-squares parameter estimates of height of the best-fitting canonical HRF for each condition were used in pair-wise contrasts. The resulting contrast images, computed on a subject-by-subject basis, were submitted to random-effects group analyses. \n\n\n### Region of interest analysis \n  \nParameter estimates were extracted from a priori defined anatomical Nacc clusters for left and right Nacc. Anatomical Nacc clusters were extracted from the Harvard-Oxford subcortical atlas and were thresholded at 40%. The region of interest was chosen since the Nacc is a primary reward area ( ) and previous studies using the same task showed peak activation when receiving rewards for self in the Nacc ( , ). Region of interest analysis was performed using the MarsBar toolbox ((  ( ) for SPM8. To check whether whole brain results for the contrasts win\u2009>\u2009lose for each beneficiary showed significant activation in the a priori defined Nacc cluster we performed whole brain analyses. On the group level contrasts for win\u2009>\u2009lose for each beneficiary (self, friend, mother) were calculated. Whole brain results were regarded significant when they exceeded a threshold of   P   < 0.05, Family Wise Error corrected at the voxel level. As expected results showed robust activation in the bilateral ventral striatum for the contrasts win>\u2009lose for self, win\u2009>\u2009lose for friend and win\u2009>\u2009lose for mother (  and  ). See whole brain tables for the contrasts comparing all three beneficiaries in  .\n   \nWhole brain contrasts for win>\u2009lose for Self, win\u2009>\u2009lose for Friend and win\u2009>\u2009lose for Mother. Contrasts were FWE corrected with a threshold of   P   < 0.05. All contrasts resulted in significant activation in the bilateral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens. Results are projected on a slice with MNI coordinate   y  \u2009=\u200912. \n    \nWhole brain table for neural activation for the contrast win\u2009>\u2009lose when playing for friend and win\u2009>\u2009lose when playing for mother \n      \nRegression coefficients (B), standard error,   t   values and   P   values for the models for friend win\u2009>\u2009lose and mother win\u2009>\u2009lose for the left and right Nacc \n      \nRegression coefficients (B), standard error,   t   values and   P   values for the models for the difference score mother win\u2009>\u2009lose \u2013 friend win\u2009>\u2009lose \n    \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Self-report measures \n  \n#### Relations between subjective ratings and age \n  \nFirst, we tested general developmental patterns of subjective ratings for winning for self, friend and mother. We used regression models to first test linear and quadratic effects of age and then test whether adding a main or interaction effect of sex improved model fit. If including effects for sex did not improve model fit, they were removed for the final model. For all three beneficiaries, the subjective rating of how much the participant liked to win for this person decreased linearly with age. Only for the rating for self the main effect of sex was significant, males rated winning for self as more pleasurable than females [self: age   \u03b2  = \u221210.5,   t  (227) = \u22125.83,   P   = <0.001, sex   \u03b2   = 0.54,   t  (227) = 2.29,   P   = 0.022; friend age   \u03b2  = \u22125.12,   t  (225) = \u22122.92,   P   = 0.004; mother age   \u03b2   = \u22124.69,   t  (221) = \u22122.55,   P   = 0.012;  ]. This indicates that even though participants of all ages rated the rewards as pleasurable (average scores\u2009>\u20097 on a scale of 1\u201310), participants rated winning in the task as less pleasurable with increasing age.\n   \nSubjective ratings for winning for Self, Friend and Mother, plotted as a function of age. The ratings for Self showed a main effect of sex. The ratings for Self are plotted in blue for males and red for females. \n  \n\nSecond, to investigate the value of winning for a friend and mother, relative to winning for self, we calculated difference scores between pleasure scores when winning for friend   v   s   winning for self, and winning for mother   vs   winning for self. In these analyses, we used winning for self as a baseline to account for any general age effects of reward experience on the task. For this purpose, we performed regression analyses with the difference score [winning for friend \u2212 winning for self] and [winning for mother \u2212 winning for self] as dependent variable. We first tested for linear and quadratic effects of age and then included main and interaction effects of sex. Sex was removed from the final model if inclusion did not result in improved model fit. \n\nResults showed a positive linear regression coefficient for age and the difference score [winning for a friend \u2013 winning for self] [age   \u03b2   = 5.34,   t  (225)=3.42,   P   < 0.001;  ]. These results indicate that winning for a friend is rated as relatively more pleasurable with increasing age. The main effect of sex was significant [sex   \u03b2   = .528,   t  (225) = \u22122.58,   P   = 0.011]. Females rated their winning for a friend relative to winning for self higher than males. There was also a positive linear effect of age for the difference score [winning for mother-winning for self] [age   \u03b2  = 5.63,   t  (222) = 3.04,   P   = 0.003;  ]. Quadratic effects were not significant for any of the models. The effect of sex was not significant. Again, this result shows that the winning for mother is rated as relatively more pleasurable with increasing age. No age or sex effects were observed for the differences between [winning for friend \u2013 winning for mother] [age   \u03b2  = \u22120.54,   t  (219) = \u22120.374,   P   = 0.709].\n   \nRegression analysis with age as predictor and the difference score for the subjective ratings [winning for friend \u2212 winning for self] (panel A) and [winning for mother \u2013 winning for self] (panel B) as dependent variable. Results showed a positive relation between age and the difference scores for both friend and mother. \n  \n\n\n#### Relations between the inclusion of other in self scale and age \n  \nFirst, we tested for general age effects on relationship closeness. Again we first tested linear and quadratic developmental patterns, and then tested whether inclusion of a main and interaction effect of sex improved model fit. For both friend and mother, the best fitting model to describe the relation between relationship closeness and age was a linear model, indication that relationship closeness decreased with age. For friend we also found a significant main effect of sex, females rated the closeness to a friend higher than males [friend age   \u03b2   = \u22123.14,   t  (225) = \u22122.44,   P   = 0.015, sex   \u03b2   = \u22120.46,   t  (225) = \u22122.71,   P   = 0.007; mother age   \u03b2   = \u22125.34,   t  (227) = \u22123.41,   P   < 0.001;  ].\n   \nRatings on the Inclusion of Other in Self scale for Friend and Mother, plotted as a function of age. Ratings for Friend are plotted in blue for males and red for females. \n  \n\n\n#### Relations between subjective ratings and inclusion of other in self scale \n  \nThe next question was how winning pleasure ratings on the gambling task related to relationship closeness as measured with the IOS. To test this relationship, we fitted separate regression models for each of the ratings. In these models the IOS rating was the dependent variable. We included a linear effect of age and the winning pleasure ratings as independent variables. Based on our hypothesis, we only tested for linear effects and then tested whether including a main and interaction effect of sex improved model fit. Results showed a positive relationship between the IOS and the rating participants provided for winning for their mother [  \u03b2  = 0.130,   t  (219) = 2.26,   P   = 0.025]. In other words, those participants who indicated that they liked it better when their mother won also indicated that they experienced more relationship closeness with their mother. Results did not show a similar relationship for friend [  \u03b2  = 0.048,   t  (222) = 0.96,   P   = 0.337]. There were no interaction effects between the subjective ratings and Sex (main effects of Sex on the Inclusion of Other in Self scale have been reported in a previous paragraph). \n\n\n\n### fMRI \n  \n#### Developmental effects \n  \nThe first question we aimed to answer concerned general developmental effects of neural responses to rewards for winning for friend and mother. Neural responses to rewards for self are described in two separate publications ( ,  ). These publications show that neural responses to rewards for self peak in adolescence. To test age related effects, we extracted parameter estimates for the contrasts win\u2009>\u2009lose for friend and win\u2009>\u2009lose for mother from a priori anatomically defined left and right Nacc clusters. We used regression models to first test linear and quadratic effects of age and then test whether adding a main or interaction effect of sex improved model fit. If including effects for sex did not improve model fit, they were removed for the final model. Two separate models were fit, one for contrast values win\u2009>\u2009lose for friend and one for contrast values win\u2009>\u2009lose for mother. \n\nFor friend, there were no linear or quadratic effects of age in the Nacc. The best fitting model was a model with only a main effect of sex [left Nacc:   \u03b2   = 0.741,   t  (231) = 2.44,   P   = 0.016; right Nacc:   \u03b2   = 0.992,   t  (231) = 3.11,   P   = 0.002]. Male participants showed higher ventral striatum responses to winning for friends than female participants, see  . We then tested how neural responses to vicarious rewards for friends (win\u2009>\u2009lose for friend) develop respective to neural responses to winning for self (win\u2009>\u2009lose for self). We calculated a differences score between win\u2009>\u2009lose friend and win\u2009>\u2009lose self, higher scores indicate higher ventral striatum responses to winning for a friend. A model with a linear regressor for age and a main and interaction term for sex showed the best fit. The interaction effect of age and sex was significant in the left Nacc and trending in the right Nacc [left Nacc: interaction Age \u00d7 Sex   \u03b2   =   \u22120.226,   t  (229) = \u22122.169,   P   = 0.031; right Nacc: interaction Age \u00d7 Sex   \u03b2   =   \u22120.208,   t  (229) = \u22121.69,   P   = 0.091). To follow up on this interaction, we tested developmental effects of age for both sexes separately. For girls, there was a significant increase in Nacc responses to win\u2009>\u2009lose for friend compared to win\u2009>\u2009lose for self [left Nacc: age   \u03b2  = 0.210,   t  (114) = 2.86,   P   = 0.005; right Nacc: age   \u03b2  = 0.190,   t  (114) = 2.03,   P   = 0.045]. During childhood and early adolescence, the left Nacc shows more activation for win\u2009>\u2009lose for self, whereas in late adolescence and adulthood the Nacc shows higher responses to win\u2009>\u2009lose for friend. For boys, there was no effect of age (  P  \u2019s > 0.82;  ).\n   \nInteraction effect of age and sex for the difference in parameter estimates for win\u2009>\u2009lose for friend and win\u2009>\u2009lose for self in the left nucleus accumbens (nacc). \n  \n\nFor mother, the best fitting model was model with a linear and quadratic regressor for age. Results showed a significant quadratic relationship with age for the contrast win\u2009>\u2009lose for mother for the right Nacc and this relationship was significant at trend level for the left Nacc [left Nacc: age   \u03b2   = \u22123.83,   t  (230) = \u22121.95,   P   = 0.052; right Nacc: age   \u03b2   = \u22126.13,   t  (230) = \u22122.79,   P   = 0.006;  ,  ). We then compared win\u2009>\u2009lose for mother and win\u2009>\u2009lose for self. There were no significant linear or quadratic age effects and no main or interaction effect with sex.\n   \nQuadratic regression with age and the parameter estimate for the contrast mother win\u2009>\u2009lose for the right nucleus accumbens (nacc). \n  \n\n\n#### Differences in neural responses to rewards for mother and friend \n  \nThe next question was whether the relative differences for neural responses to winning for mother and friend were different for any of the ages. To answer this question, we calculated a difference score between contrast values for win\u2009>\u2009lose for mother and win\u2009>\u2009lose for friend. Positive values indicate higher neural responses for mother and negative values indicate higher neural responses for friend. Again we tested a model that included linear and quadratic effects of age, and main and interaction effects of sex. \n\nWe found a significant linear main effect of age [left Nacc: age   \u03b2  = \u221210.43,   t  (227) = \u22122.48,   P   = 0.014; right Nacc: age   \u03b2   = \u22129.01,   t  (227) = \u22121.95,   P   = 0.052], a main effect of sex [left Nacc: sex  \u03b2   = \u22120.982,   t  (227) = \u22122.66,   P   = 0.008; right Nacc: sex  \u03b2   = \u22121.423,   t  (227) = \u22123.52,   P   = 0.0005] and an interaction effect between the linear regressor of age and sex [left Nacc: interaction age \u00d7 sex   \u03b2\u2009  =\u200914.80,   t  (227) = 2.61,   P   = 0.009; right Nacc: interaction age \u00d7 sex  \u03b2\u2009  =\u200911.18,   t  (227) = 1.79,   P   = 0.074]. This interaction effect indicates that neural responses to rewards for friends and mother follow a different trajectory over age for males and females. To follow up on this interaction, we tested the age effect separately for females and males. For females, neural responses to winning shifted from a stronger response for mothers in childhood and early adolescence to a stronger response for friends in late adolescence and early adulthood [left Nacc: age   \u03b2   =   \u22120.18,   t  (114) = \u22122.42,   P   = 0.017; right Nacc: age   \u03b2  = \u22120.15,   t  (114) = \u22121.93,   P   = 0.057] whereas for males neural responses to winning for mother and friend were similar across ages [left Nacc:   \u03b2  = 0.070,   t  (115) = 1.07,   P   = 0.289; right Nacc:   \u03b2  = 0.028,   t  (115) = 0.37,   P   = 0.709;  ).\n   \nInteraction effect between age and sex in the left nucleus accumbens. The dependent variable was a difference score between parameter estimates for the contrast [win\u2009>\u2009lose for mother] \u2013 [win\u2009>\u2009lose for friend]. Positive values indicate higher neural responses for mother and negative values indicate higher neural responses for friend. For females, neural responses to winning shifted from a stronger response for mother in childhood/early adolescence to a stronger response for friends in young adulthood. In contrast, for males neural responses to winning for mother and friend do not significantly differ with age. \n  \n\n\n#### Relations with self-report measures \n  \nFinally, we tested for relations between neural activation for the contrasts win\u2009>\u2009lose for friend and win\u2009>\u2009lose mother with self-reported winning pleasure and IOS scales. We fitted separate regression models for the IOS rating for mother and friend. In these models, the IOS rating was the dependent variable and age, sex and an interaction term for age and sex as well as a regressor for the parameter estimates win\u2009>\u2009lose were included as independent variables. There were no relationships between neural activation and self-report measures. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we tested how responses to vicarious rewards for friends and mothers change over adolescent development. To do so, we used a combination of behavioral and neural measures. Results showed that both subjective behavioral ratings for winning (i.e. winning pleasure) for friends and mothers, and relationship closeness with mothers and friends decreased with age. When controlling for age, relationship closeness and winning pleasure for mothers were positively related. On the neural level, whole brain contrasts for winning\u2009>\u2009losing money for peers and mothers resulted in robust activation in the ventral striatum, consistent with prior research (Braams   et al.  , 2014;  ;  ). Age and sex related changes in neural responses for mothers and friends were also present and these results are discussed in more detail below. \n\n### Winning   v   s   losing for friend and mother \n  \nInterestingly, there were no age-related differences in ventral striatum responses in adolescence when playing for friends, even though peers are a very salient social context during this life period ( ;  ). When playing for mother we found a quadratic effect of age, with the highest contrast values in mid-adolescence. These findings mirror previous results showing heightened bilateral ventral striatum activity in mid adolescence relative to younger and older participants when playing for self ( ). The similarity between these patterns indicates that the heightened reward sensitivity in mid adolescence is not limited to hedonic (i.e. self related) rewards. These findings fit well with recent insights showing that heightened rewards activity in mid adolescence is not only associated with negative outcomes, such as increased risk taking ( ) or alcohol use ( ), but can also be related to greater motivation to being prosocial towards family ( ). The neural responses to rewards for mothers may coincide with stronger prosocial values towards family members ( ). \n\nFurther support for the notion that the ventral striatum response is linked to prosocial values comes from a study in which adolescents could win money for their family members. Adolescents who report feeling happier on days that they help their family, also show higher responses in the ventral striatum when winning money for their family ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Sex differences when winning   v   s   losing for a friend \n  \nEven though, there were no general age differences in neural activity in the ventral striatum when winning   vs   losing for friends, interesting sex differences were found in behavioral ratings and neural responses. First, girls reported higher levels of closeness to their friends than boys, consistent with prior research showing that girls often experience a more intimate relationship with their best friend, whereas boys often interact with larger groups of peers ( ;  ). \n\nAt the neural level, however, boys showed in general higher neural responses in the ventral striatum when winning for friends than girls. Prior studies have suggested that there may be differences between prosocial motivation (feeling closeness to friends) and prosocial actions. A behavioral study found that boys were more willing to share resources with unknown others when this resulted in mutual benefit, whereas girls preferred equity of outcomes ( ). Possibly, girls experience more prosocial intentions and motivations, whereas boys experience more reward when actually sharing with friends. This gender discrepancy between prosocial motivation and prosocial outcomes, and the relation with neural activity, should be examined in more detail in future studies. \n\nTwo additional developmental sex differences emerged. First, when comparing winning for friends with winning for self, there was an age-related increase in winning for friends relative to self, specifically for girls. Second, when comparing winning for friends with winning for mothers, again there was an age-related increase in winning for friends relative to mother, specifically for girls. Together these findings suggest that there may be a developmental change in prosocial motivations related to friends in adolescent girls, such that vicarious rewards for friends start to play a larger role in late adolescence and adulthood. Future studies should test the relation between vicarious rewards, behavior, and self-reported friendship relations in more detail. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe current study also had limitations that should be addressed in future research. First, the current paradigm was not set up to distinguish between developmental trajectories of neural responses to wins and losses separately. Future studies could include a baseline condition, such as a zero win or loss condition, to investigate whether striatum responses to wins peak in adolescence or adolescents are more sensitive to losses. For the current data set, we can only interpret the relative differences between winning and losing, therefore it remains to be determined if the results are reflecting an increase for rewards or a decrease for losing over time (see also  ). \n\nSecond, the adolescents in this sample overall reported high closeness to their mothers. This may explain the absence of a relationship between the neural measures and behavioral ratings, i.e. possibly the measures were not sensitive enough to detect individual differences. It will be important in future studies to have a larger battery of behavioral measures to link neural activity for vicarious rewards to behavioral measures. \n\nA third limitation of the current study is the cross-sectional design. Future studies should test if these results are predictive of developmental outcomes later in time. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, this study showed that neural responses to vicarious rewards for close others results in ventral striatum activation ( ). Furthermore, we show that the developmental trajectory of neural responses to vicarious rewards is dependent on the beneficiary. In girls, neural responses to vicarious rewards for friends compared to rewards for self increase over development, whereas neural responses to rewards for mothers peak in mid to late adolescence (16\u201317 years). The current results support the account that friends and mothers are important social factors across adolescence ( ). \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis work was supported by a European Research Council (ERC) starting grant (ERC-2010-StG-263234) awarded to E.A.C. \n\n\n## Supplementary data \n  \n are available at   SCAN   online. \n\n Conflict of interest  .

The individual data from fMRI of primary sensory, motor, and language representation were analyzed and compared with respective comprehensive etiological, clinical, and morphological data. Patients were examined clinically and psychologically, and investigated by structural and functional 3T GE scanner. A correlation between the type and extent of the lesion (involvement of cortical and subcortical structures), timing of lesion, type of reorganization (laterality index), and clinical and psychological outcome was done. \n\n Results:   Significant interindividual diversity was found in the patient group predominantly in the patterns of motor reorganization. Patients with small periventricular lesions have ipsilesional representation of primary motor, sensory, and word generation function. Patients with lesions involving left cortico-subcortical regions show various models of reorganization in all three modalities (ipsilesional, contralesional, and bilateral) and different clinical outcome that seem to be impossible for prediction. However, patients with UCP who demonstrate ipsilesional motor cortical activation have better motor functional capacity. \n\n Conclusion:   The type and size of the pre/perinatal lesion in left hemisphere could affect the natural potential of the young brain for reorganization and therefore the clinical outcome. Much larger sample and additional correlation with morphological data (volumetry, morphometry, tractography) is needed for determination of possible risk or protective factors that could play a role in the complex process of brain plasticity. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTranslational neuroscience has developed over the past few decades as innovative field to bridge knowledge across disciplines in medicine and especially to translate data/knowledge from fundamental neurosciences (such as neurobiology) to explanation of human brain functions in health and disease ( ). \n\nBrain reorganization after early lesions in the developing brain has been an object of extensive scientific work, but even with the achievements from translational neuroscience in the last 20 years it is still not clarified which factors could predict type of reorganization and rehabilitation potential of patients with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP) due to pre/perinatal insult. UCP implies an excellent model for studying brain plasticity. It comprises heterogenic conditions in terms of etiology, timing, morphology, clinical signs, and severity of impairments ( ). Variety of unilateral brain lesions, acquired in the pre/perinatal period could lead to UCP with abnormal motor behavior as the core feature of this unprogressive condition. Lesions acquired during the first two trimesters of pregnancy interfere with the processes of neuronal migration, proliferation, and cortical organization, leading to cortical malformations and, thus, disturb the normal function of the affected area. Lesions that are acquired in the third trimester and in early postnatal life disrupt structures that are already formed, but also interfere with the processes of dendritic arborization, axonal sprouting, and myelination. The size and extent of the lesion in the hemisphere, as well as its type\u2014periventricular lesion (PVL) or cortico-subcortical lesion (CSL)\u2014 could affect these processes in different ways ( ). The brain maturation and reorganization might be additionally influenced by the factors leading to the initial insult like genetic conditions, infections, neonatal encephalopathy, and medical intervention, and also by postinsult events like early therapeutic intervention and epilepsy. Recent studies comment on the inability of the immature brain to follow the simple Kennard principle due to many events that shape different developmental trajectory ( ). Taking all these reasons together, applying one unified model of brain reorganization in patients with UCP seems impossible, and three main models of reorganization\u2014ipsilesional, contralesional, and bilateral have been widely discussed ( ). Despite the growing number of studies in this area, it still remains difficult to predict individual remodeling. Functional MRI (fMRI) is a novel method, which is an excellent tool for studying brain reorganization in various brain functions (motor, sensory, language, cognition, etc.) using different tasks. Due to its noninvasive nature and good spatial and acceptable temporal resolution, it is widely used in studies of developmental disorders. UCP represents an appealing model for the study of brain plasticity for several main reasons: \n  \n- Lesion is acquired before 2 years of age, when reorganization potential of the contralesional hemisphere is significant due to the ongoing development of the normal projections ( ). \n  \n- The study is conducted when reorganization is already completed (it\u2019s most intensive during 6 months after injury) and the type of reorganization is more or less fixed ( ). \n  \n- Most of the lesions could be specified in time of appearance with high certainty depending on risk factors, prenatal imaging techniques, type of lesion, etc. ( ). \n  \nUnfortunately, it remains very difficult to homogenize the group of studied patients so that a large sample study can be achieved for sufficient statistical results. UCP is a rare disorder with cumulative prevalence of 0.6 to 1   per   1,000 live births. The exact prevalence of CP is unknown in Bulgaria, but the largest Bulgarian study on CP included 143 patients with UCP out of CP sample of 521 patients (personal correspondence with Dr. Elena Rodopska, University Hospital \u201cSt. Naum,\u201d Sofia, Bulgaria). UCP is an umbrella term that includes several conditions that vary in etiology and morphology ( ). With demographic variables added, it is almost impossible to obtain homogeneous group of patients. Moreover, the study samples are reduced due to absence of motivation or inability to perform the task inside the MRI. These challenges explain the relatively small sample number of patients with UCP that were included in fMRI studies in literature\u2014between 3 and 25 ( ). \n\nThe aim of this study is to analyze the type of motor, language, and sensory brain reorganization in patients with right-sided cerebral palsy due to pre/perinatal isolated left-sided brain lesions taking into consideration the type (cortico-subcortical or periventricular) and extent (gray and white matter damage) of the lesion, etiology, comorbidity, and other postnatal factors that could have played a role in the complex process of brain plasticity. \n\n\n## Material and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe study was performed prospectively in the Complex of Translational Neuroscience, Medical University\u2014Plovdiv for the period 2017\u20132019. Eight patients with diagnosis of right-sided cerebral palsy (three males, aged 13\u201315 years, and five females, aged 10\u201330 years) were included in the study. \n\nThe inclusion criteria were: \n  \n- Congenital right-sided hemiparesis with MACS level \u22643 \n  \n- Mental age >7 years \n  \n- Unilateral left-sided brain lesion proved by a brain image \n  \n- Fulfilled informed consent (from either the patient or his parent if the patient is under the age of 18 years) for participation in the study \n  \nThe exclusion criteria were: \n  \n- Patient and his parents\u2019 disagreement for participation in the study \n  \n- Impossibility to stay calm during fMRI scan \n  \n- Uncooperativeness of the patients or inability to perform the fMRI paradigms \n  \n- Presence of implants in the patients\u2019 body, which is contraindication for MRI \n  \nThe patients were examined by clinical and psychological tests and investigated by structural 3T scan and fMRI tests. \n\nThe study design was approved by the Ethical Committee of Medical University\u2014Plovdiv. \n\n\n### Procedures \n  \n#### Clinical and Psychological Examination \n  \nThe medical interview with the patients included questions about familial risk factors, risk factors during pregnancy, delivery, and early postnatal period, time of diagnosis, laboratory, genetic, and imaging data, type and duration of rehabilitation, and comorbidities (epilepsy, cognitive deficits, visual and other sensory deficits). Clinical investigation (physical and neurologic examination) was done by either a specialist in pediatric neurology or adult neurologist. \n\nSeverity of movement dif\ufb01culties was evaluated by the score on the Manual Ability Classi\ufb01cation System (MACS) and the Modi\ufb01ed Ashworth Scale (MAS). The MACS classi\ufb01es a person\u2019s ability to handle objects in important daily activities across a \ufb01ve-point scale (level I\u2014handle most objects easily; to level V\u2014severely limited in their ability) ( ). MAS further characterized the children by documenting severity of movement restriction due to spasticity across the elbow, wrist, \ufb01ngers, and thumb (0\u2014indicating no movement restriction, to 4\u2014re\ufb02ecting rigidity/severe contracture). The sensory examination included examination of touch, pain, joint position sense, stereognosis, and graphesthesia. Rehabilitation was classified as absent (\u2212), rare\u2014less than one course   per   month (+), moderate\u2014one or more courses   per   month (++), and frequent\u2014every day (+++). Time of onset of rehabilitation was registered for every patient. All participants received psychological evaluation by a psychologist with IQ (WISC-IV), as well as evaluation for dyslexia with DDE-2 battery, both adapted in Bulgarian language ( ,  ). \n\n\n#### Mri Procedure \n  \n##### Data Acquisition \n  \nScanning of all patients was executed on a 3\u0422 MRI system\u2014GE Discovery 750w with a protocol including a structural scan: SagT1 FSPGR BRAVO, slice thickness 1 mm, matrix 256 \u00d7 256, flip angle 12\u00b0. Additional AxFLAIR scan was performed for better qualification of lesions. The protocol for all functional scans contained 2D Echo planar imaging, slice thickness 3 mm, matrix 96 \u00d7 96, relaxation time 3,000 ms, echo time \u221230, and flip angle 90\u00b0. Before each functional scan, five dummy time series were acquired. \n\n\n##### Experimental Paradigms \n  \nAll patients were familiarized with the fMRI procedure through animated presentation. The experiment contained five paradigms, each implemented in block design: two active movement conditions\u2014left (ML) and right (MR) hand finger tapping; two passive sensory conditions\u2014left (SL) and right (SR) hand brushing; and a word generation paradigm. During one session, each task was performed for 30 sec and repeated 5 times after 30 sec of rest. Finger tapping task was performed with repetitive touching of first and second finger with frequency of approximately 1 Hz. Movements were directly observed by an experimenter. Hand brushing task was performed with gentle brushing of the back of each hand with frequency of 1 Hz by the same experimenter. The beginning of each active and passive block for the motor and sensory paradigm was presented on the screen in front of the patient with the word \u201cStart\u201d and \u201cStop,\u201d respectively. For the word generation task there were five different letters presented on the screen (one for each block of the task) and the patient was asked to think of as many words as possible, starting with the letter presented on the screen (silent generation of words). The total duration of the functional scan was 25 min. Paradigms were shown in a randomized order. \n\n\n##### Analysis of Imaging Data \n  \nPreprocessing steps were carried out using custom routines available in SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College, London, UK,  ) . Images were corrected for head movements by realigning all images with the first image of the first session, and a mean image of the realigned volumes was created. To remove variance due to unwanted head movements that might have been task-related, images were unwrapped ( ). The 3D-dataset was segmented in native space, using a unified segmentation approach ( ). The segmented tissue maps were coregistered to the mean functional image from the first session. The crucial step of normalization capitalizes on the fact that chronic lesions are overwhelmingly classified as CSF during tissue segmentation ( ). This tissue class is then used as the basis for an automatically generated lesion mask which in turn is used to implement a cost-function masking approach ( ) during spatial normalization. These segmentation parameters were used to normalize the functional series to a final resolution of 2\u00d72\u00d72 mm. In the end, the images were spatially smoothed 8 mm full width at half-maximum (FWHM). \n\nThe model for first-level analysis was then specified with parameters estimated, and t-contrasts defined for active versus passive condition for all five experiments (Motor Right\u2014MR, Motor Left\u2014ML, Sensory Right\u2014SR, Sensory Left\u2014SL, Word Generation\u2014WG). The level of significance was set at   p   < 0.05 familywise error corrected and cluster extent threshold of 10 voxels. Statistical results were presented using SPM extension Bspm view ( ) . \n\nLaterality index (LI) was calculated for motor and language representation using the commercially available tool LI ( ) . LI was obtained by computing LI = (nL \u2212 nR)/(nL + nR), where nL and nR are the number of activated voxels in left (LH) and right (RH) hemisphere, respectively ( ). The absolute value 0.10 was used as threshold for de\ufb01nite lateralization ( ). Patients with a positive index (LI > 0.10) were considered left-lateralized for language, while those with a negative index (LI < \u22120.10) were considered as right-lateralized. Values of |LI| = 0.10 represent a \u201cbilateral\u201d or uncertain activation. For calculation of LI for language representation, the total number of voxels in the gray matter was used, while LI for motor representation was calculated using the number of activated voxels only in the primary motor cortex (PMC). \n\nThe extent of injury of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) was classified according to maximum width of lesion as 1 = mild (<10 mm), 2 = moderate (10\u201320 mm), and 3 = severe (>20\u2009mm) ( ). Lesional volume was calculated and visualized using MRICron ( ). \n\nPresumed timing of the lesions was judged by the criteria offered by ( ) malformation of the cortical development (MCD) occurs during I and II trimester, while PVL and CSL during III trimester or perinatally. In addition, PVL could be approximately assigned to the period of 24\u201336 weeks of gestation, and CSL after 36 weeks of gestation ( ). \n\n\n##### Statistical Analysis of Behavioral and Imaging Data \n  \nDue to the small number of subjects, no statistical analysis on group level was done. Patients were divided in three main groups depending on type of the lesion, and comments were made on group and individual level, associated with various behavioral data. \n\n\n\n\n### Results \n  \n#### Demographic and Clinical Data With Risk Factors for Pre/Perinatal Brain Lesions \n  \nFive of the patients had radiological evidence of involvement of unilateral cortical and subcortical regions in the territory supplied by the left middle cerebral artery, further referred to as CSL lesions (P1\u20135), probable arterial infarction. Two had no cortical involvement but only unilateral PVL, presenting with mild enlargement of the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle and periventricular T1 hypointensity and FLAIR hyperintensity\u2014presumable venous infarctions or unilateral periventricular leukomalacia (P6 and P7). One had MCD\u2014closed lip left-sided schizencephaly (P8) ( ). \n  \nCoronal section of T1 Structural MRI of all eight patients showing their brain lesions (lesion represented in red color). Images are presented   via   MRICron and therefore flipped\u2014left side of the brain is on the left side of the image. \n  \nAll five patients with CSL (MCA-infarction) had second and third degree of involvement of both cortex and adjacent white matter tracts including partially the Rolandic and the Broca area ( ). For the patient with MCD this involvement was of lesser extent (first degree). Both patients with PVL had involvement of the anterior portion of the internal capsule, defined as first-degree white matter injury. There was no cortical involvement for the patients with PVL. \n  \nDemographic and clinical data of patients. \n  \nF, female; M, male; LMCA, left middle cerebral artery; PVL, periventricular lesion; MCD, malformation of cortical development; NA, not available. \n  \nFunctional capacity measured by MACS was very good in both patients with PVL, poor in the patient with MCD, and variable in the patients with CSL. The same distribution was found for the degree of limb spasticity, measured by MAS. \n\nNo patient was found to have sensory deficits during clinical examination of touch, pain, joint position, stereognosis, and graphesthesia. \n\nFive of six patients with cortical involvement (four CSL and the MCD) had epilepsy with partial or secondary generalized seizures originating from the left hemisphere. All of them were under a stable dose of anticonvulsive medication by the time of the study. \n\nIQ varied from 50 to 90 ( ). \n\nFour out of five patients with CSL and one out of two with PVL were dyslexic. One patient couldn\u2019t be evaluated for dyslexia, because of lack of cooperativeness. \n\nThe risk factors presumably involved in the brain damage causing the lesions were: risk pregnancy (found in three patients), prematurity (none of the tested patients), genetic thrombophilia factors (one patient), birth asphyxia and trauma (one patient). Timing of these factors was referred to occurrence of the lesion, i.e., severe birth asphyxia in P5 and finding of left porencephalic cyst leads to diagnosis of left middle cerebral artery infarction that we assumed as having occurred at birth. Maternal bleeding around 26th gestational week and finding of closed lip shizencephalic cleft could also suggest the time of insult. \n\n\n#### Activation During Motor Task With the Impaired Hand \n  \nAll eight patients completed finger tapping task successfully with the right hand. Mirror movements during the task were observed in P1 and P3. \n\nDuring finger tapping with the impaired hand three types of activation in the PMC were found ( ): \n  \nPredominant activation in preserved areas of left precentral gyrus\u2014M1 (ipsilateral to the lesion) in four patients (two with PVL: P6 and P7, and two with CSL: P4 and P5) \n  \nBilateral distribution of the activation in PMC\u2014in two patients (one with CSL: P1, and the one with MCD: P8) \n  \nActivation only in the contralesional (right) precentral gyrus\u2014in the other two patients with CSL (P2 and P3) \n    \nExamples of render images of the three different patterns of activation during motor task with the impaired right hand (MR task). Color bar represents t-value. \n  \nAdditional extensive activation in various cortical regions in both hemispheres was observed in all patients, involving areas outside typical motor system representation. \n\nA clear association was found between functional capacity of the patients and the type of reorganization: all four patients with MACS level I showed predominantly left-sided activation in the PMC, while those with MACS level II and III had either bilateral or right-sided activation. Patients with PVL showed strong ipsilesional activation, while patients with cortical involvement had all three patterns of activation in their PMC. As to extend of the lesion, P6 and P7 who had first degree of injury and no GM involvement showed ipsilesional activation, while the other patient with small lesion (<10 mm) but with cortical involvement showed bilateral activation with LI (\u22120.03). Patients with second degree of injury showed two completely different patterns\u2014contra- or ipsilesional activation (P3 and P5), similar to P1, P2, and P4, who had the greatest extend of injury to both white and gray matter. Rehabilitation frequency didn\u2019t seem to affect the reorganization\u2014P5 and P6 who showed ipsilesional activation had very frequent rehabilitation, unlike P 4 and P7 who had similar lesions and patterns of motor activation, but had barely conducted rehabilitation. \n\n\n#### Activation During Motor Task\u2014Nonimpaired Hand \n  \nFinger tapping paradigm with the left hand was performed successfully by all p\u0430tients and no mirror movements were observed during the task. Results were pretty consistent in all patients showing activation in their right PMC with different degrees ( ) and  . Unlike motor task with the impaired hand, additional activation was observed only in regions typically involved with motor processing, like basal ganglia bilaterally or contralateral cerebellum. No extensive activation of other cortical regions was found. \n  \nActivation in the PMC during finger tapping with the nonimpaired hand. \n  \nML, motor left; LMCA, left middle cerebral artery; LPVL, left periventricular lesion; LMCD, left malformation of cortical development; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute. \n    \nExample of activation during motor task with the nonimpaired left hand (ML task) of P3. Activation is found in the right precentral gyrus, right putamen, and left cerebellar lobule IV, V, VIII, IX. Color bar represents t-value. \n  \n\n#### Activation During Language Task \n  \nCSL patients showed either right lateralization of cortical activation during the language task (P1, P4, P5), or bilateral one (P2, P3). The MCD (P8) patient showed bilateral activation during the language task. Left-sided predominance (typical for healthy controls) was found in the two PVL patients (P6, P7) (  and  ). \n\nDyslexic patients showed various patterns of activation: two with right lateralization, two bilateral, and one left lateralization. Patients who neither had epilepsy nor treatment showed language lateralization shifted to the left hemisphere (P6, P7) or bilateral (P2). \n  \nActivation in right and left hemisphere during the language task (WG). \n  \nLMCA, left middle cerebral artery; LPVL, left periventricular lesion; LMCD, left malformation of cortical development; NA, not available; LI, laterality index. \n\nLateralization to the right hemisphere:  \n\nBilateral representation:  \n\nLateralization to the left hemisphere:  \n    \nTwo types of activation during WG task. None of the patients shown on the figure was found to be dyslexic. \n  \n\n#### Sensory Task\u2014Impaired Hand \n  \nOnly one patient (P3) could not conduct hand brushing task because she could not endure the full length of the protocol. All patients with PVL and the patient with MCD had left postcentral gyrus activation, as well as the two CSL patients (P4 and P5) in whom the lesion did not encompass the entire left postcentral gyrus. Two other patients with CSL (P1 and P2) showed no activation in the primary sensory cortex; instead there was significant activation of posteriorly or anteriorly located regions. All four patients with CSL showed additional involvement of other areas outside the sensory cortex in both hemispheres. No one showed activation in the contralesional primary sensory cortex during hand brushing task on the impaired hand (SR). \n\nComparison with the behavioral data showed some association between the quality of motor function and the area of cortical sensory representation: participants with better motor performance (MACS level I) showing sensory reorganization in the left postcentral gyrus, while participants with worse MACS level (P1 and P2) showing shifting of the activation during SR outside the postcentral gyrus (  and  ). \n  \nActivation in the primary sensory cortex during SR task. \n  \nSR, sensory right; LMCA, left middle cerebral artery; LPVL, left periventricular lesion; LMCD, left malformation of cortical development; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute. \n\nActivation outside left postcentral gyrus:  \n\nActivation in the left postcentral gyrus:  \n    \nDifferent patterns of cortical activation during sensory task on impaired right hand (SR). P1 has activation close to left postcentral gyrus, but not located in the gyrus, in contrast to P7 where the activation involves wide zone of the left postcentral gyrus. Color bar represents t-value. Sensory Task\u2014Nonimpaired Left Hand \n  \nTwo patients (one PVL: P6, and one CSL: P1) showed no suprathreshold activation in either left or right primary sensory cortex during hand brushing of the nonimpaired hand. Two CSL patients (P2 and P4) and one MCD (P8) patient had only contralateral activation in right postcentral gyrus; one CSL (P5) and one PVL patient (P7) showed involvement of both primary sensory cortices ( ). \n  \nActivation in primary sensory cortex during SL task. \n  \nSL, sensory left; LMCA, left middle cerebral artery; LPVL, left periventricular lesion; LMCD, left malformation of cortical development; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute. \n  \n\n\n### Discussion \n  \nUCP amounts up to 30% of all CPs and is an appealing model for the study of brain plasticity by fMRI because of coexistence of nonprogressive brain lesion in one hemisphere, and normal surrounding tissues in the same one, and non- or less affected opposite hemisphere, which allows the compensation mechanisms for some functions. fMRI shows that the nondominant hemisphere could acquire dominance or codominance in motor, visual, auditory, and language functions after pre/perinatal brain lesions in dominant hemisphere ( ). \n\nHowever, patients with UCP have considerable variability in etiology, time of appearance, size, and location of the lesion, as well as functional capacity, making it difficult to obtain not only large homogeneous patient samples, but also a unified model of brain reorganization. Reported causes of UCP are periventricular white matter lesions, posthemorrhagic porencephalic lesions, infarcts in the middle cerebral artery, and brain malformations ( ). Despite the great capacity for plasticity of immature brain and the proposed largely linear relationship between age at brain injury and functional outcome, great variability in outcome from early brain insult is observed, including poor recovery from early prenatal lesions ( ). \n\nIn our study we applied an individual approach to present the model of reorganization of motor, sensory, and language functions in every patient, and then tried to analyze the established models of brain reorganization in accordance with the etiological type, size and location of the lesion, time of appearance of the lesion, or functional capacity of the patient. Due to the small group of patients, we assume more descriptive approach to our data. Analyzing the reorganization of all three domains within the same patients has not been considered in the previous studies, so we believe that it is the main strength of our study. \n\n\n### Motor Reorganization \n  \nPopulation studies of children with perinatally acquired unilateral lesions show they have better quality of life than those with bilateral lesions, which is in direct correlation with the better GMFCS (Gross Motor Function Classification System) level ( ). Nevertheless those patients usually experience motor, sensory, language, visiospatial, or executive difficulties, which interfere with their everyday life. Children with UCP could never achieve a normal hand function in contrast with language abilities with even minor lesion in the corticospinal tract leading to motor impairment ( ). \n\nOur results confirmed the variety of functional motor capacity of patients with pre/perinatally acquired unilateral left hemispheric lesions, demonstrating MACS level varying from I to III. \n\n#### Models of Motor Reorganization \n  \nThree models of functional motor reorganization have been found in patients with UCP: only contralesional; only ipsilesional; and bilateral. A recent systematic review showed bilateral activation with stronger contralesional predominance to be the most common model for motor reorganization in UCP ( ). \n\nCao et al. showed bilateral activation during paretic hand movement in all patients, but all of them have cortical lesions (MCDs or CSLs) ( ). Similar results in patients with big cortical lesions are reported also by Staudt et al. and Vandermeeren et al. ( ,  ). Bilateral activation was reported by Staudt et al. also in patients with small PVL, but in the premotor area ( ). \n\nIn our study we chose to concentrate on the PMC as site of motor representation. We hypothesize that motor function could be a direct consequence of the number of active neurons left in their original place in the precentral gyrus. \n\nOur study results showed only two out of eight patients had contralesional activation and another two patients bilateral activation. The remaining four patients showed ipsilesional activation which is the rarest model in literature ( ). We suppose that methodological and other issues may have an effect on the variability of the models of reorganization, but probably the most important variable is the type and extent of the lesions. \n\n\n#### Models of Reorganization According to the Type, Location, and Size of the Lesion \n  \nUsually patients with lesions involving the left Rolandic area more often had bilateral and/or right predominant activation in M1. Activation of contralesional PMC occurs in patients with severe lesion and absent ipsilesional crossing corticospinal projections, which makes this motor cortex probably the only cortical motor area. Nevertheless, this is also a rare model of reorganization (review  ). Contralesional activation of motor cortex is suggested to be a result of preservation of the ipsilateral projections from previous stages of development, or to axonal sprouting in \u201cnormal\u201d crossed corticospinal axons from the unaffected hemisphere with new collateral branches re-crossing the midline to innervate motor neurons on the paretic side ( ). \n  \nPatterns of activation in the PMC during finger tapping task with the impaired hand (MR). \n  \nMR, motor right; LMCA, left middle cerebral artery; LPVL, left periventricular lesion; LMCD, left malformation of cortical development; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; LI, laterality index. \n\nIpsilesional activation:  \n\nBilateral activation:  \n\nContralesional activation:  \n  \nOur patients with CSL with extent of GM and WM injury: two or three showed different models of brain reorganization during motor task with impaired hand; two of five showed contralesional activation of motor cortex; one of five bilateral and two of five ipsilesional. P4 and P5 had large lesions that involve the Rolandic cortex, but not entirely and showed ipsilesional activation during the motor task. We presume that in these two patients the projections from the spared part of the Rolandic cortex played sufficient role in the motor control and didn\u2019t allow the contralesional projections to take over. It is known that the pattern of reorganization varies according to the extent of preservation of the motor area and its connections to the spinal cord ( ). However, we could hypothesize that other individual factors like rehabilitation could also play a role in this type of reorganization. In P5, rehabilitation was started early (at 6 months of age) and was conducted daily for years, whereas in P4 no protective factor could be identified, but he was the one with genetically proven thrombophilia (mutation in PAI, ACE, and FV Leiden genes). \n\nResults from patients without cortical involvement (P6 and P7 in our study) are consistent with the findings of Staudt et al. that patients with small PVL show strong ipsilesional activation ( ). \n\n\n#### Models of Reorganization and Time of Brain Injury \n  \nPrevious studies have hypothesized that timing of the lesion is one of the best predictors for good motor performance and reorganization potential with better functional capacity achieved after early lesion (I, II, and early III trimester) ( ). Our study, however, does not show consistency with this theory: P8 having an MCD (timing\u2014II trimester) has severely impaired hand function with MACS level III, while P4 having CSL (timing\u2014late III trimester) has almost normal hand function with MACS level I. However, our study population included only one patient with brain lesion occurring earlier than III trimester, like MCD, which doesn\u2019t allow definite conclusion on this matter. \n\n\n#### Models of Reorganization and Motor Performance \n  \nOur results showed association between left-sided lateralization of the activation in M1 and better hand performance, which is in support of the thesis that normal or near-to-normal hand function seems possible only with preserved crossed corticospinal projections from the contralateral hemisphere. Similar results have been found in the TMS study of Holmstr\u00f6m et al. with better performance on the Box and Blocks test and AHA (Assisting Hand Assessment) of children with ipsilesional motor projections, as well as in the study of Jang et al. ( ,  ). Fiori et al. in a case report also discussed that it was not very likely for the intact contralesional hemisphere alone to be sufficient for a normal function of the ipsilateral hand in the presence of an early unilateral lesion in the opposite hemisphere ( ). \n\nMackey et al. found correlation between preserved ipsilesional motor control and hand motor function and suggested it as a result of intact intracortical and interhemispheric inhibition ( ). The other explanation of this correlation is the \u201ccrowding\u201d theory and the effect of representation of motor function for both hands in one cortical region with impossibility of one motor cortex to be \u201cenough\u201d for both hands ( ). \n\nBased on our results we could also conclude that patients with UCP demonstrating ipsilesional activation of PMC during motor task have better motor functional capacity. \n\n\n\n### Sensory Reorganization \n  \nUnlike other studies none of our patients experienced sensory deficits, even those with cortical lesions involving big part of the postcentral gyrus. \n\nDespite the variability in age, gender, clinical characteristics, level of sensory deficits, and type of lesion, patients with UCP demonstrated predominant compensation through ipsilesional reorganization of the sensory function ( ,  ). Recent systematic review revealed that almost all patients showed activation only in the ipsilesional hemisphere during sensory tasks and our results were in consistency with previously reported data ( \u2013 ). We found that reorganization in the sensory system occurred ipsilateral to the lesion independently on either its type or extent, or type of motor reorganization. Patients with damaged sensory cortex typically activate the intact portions of the postcentral gyrus with a somewhat more variable topography ( ). Functionally, many of these patients show severe somatosensory deficits, which sometimes contrast with relatively spared motor abilities ( ). However no one of our patients was found to have sensory deficits, despite the wide destruction of the primary sensory cortex in some patients. \n\nIt is interesting to discuss the possible relationship between sensory and motor functions and their cortical representations in patients with UCP. \n\nAccording to our results, representation of primary motor and primary sensory function in different hemispheres is associated with worse hand function. This dissociation of lateralization is determined only by the type of motor representation, because sensory reorganization was found to be always ipsilesional. The possible explanation of this result has been commented in the discussion of motor reorganization, but other explanation of impaired motor function might be the dissociation of sensory input and motor output to different hemispheres. This has been suggested by several authors ( ,  ). Bigger destruction of the primary sensory cortex with shifting of the sensory function to the neighboring cortical areas also leads to worsening of the motor function (P1 and P2). Both concepts (motor and sensory presentation in different hemispheres, and atypical ipsilesional sensory representation) may hamper the sensorimotor integration, which is important for skillful hand movements. \n\nConsidering the few number of studies and the small groups of patients ( \u2013 ), further research on the reorganization of the sensory system in UCP, especially in combination with the reorganization of the motor and language systems, will contribute to better understanding of brain neuroplasticity. \n\n\n### Language Reorganization \n  \nChildren with pre- or perinatal brain injury of the dominant hemisphere could acquire age-appropriate language, in contrast to the aphasia following similar lesions in adulthood ( ,  ). Recent studies support the hypothesis of the \u201cdormant circuitry\u201d available for language function that is inhibited in the nondominant hemisphere of healthy children, but which may be activated when primary regions in the dominant hemisphere become unavailable to exert inhibition ( \u2013 ). A shift of language production to the right hemisphere (zones that are homotopic to the original left language zones) has been registered in most children with congenital left hemispheric lesions by dichotic listening tests ( \u2013 ) and by fMRI ( \u2013 ). However, left hemisphere lesion does not obligatorily induce a shift of language representation to the right hemisphere ( ,  ). \n\nSeveral models of language reorganization in patients with right-sided UCP and left-sided brain lesions are described: bilateral activation with either ipsilesional or contralesional dominance; only ipsilesional activation; only contralesional activation. Bilateral activation with contralesional dominance prevails in more than a half of the investigated patients ( ). Our results are in concordance with these data: three out of eight patients demonstrated bilateral activation; two of them suffering from large left MCA infarction and one with schizencephaly; three other showed contralesional (right-sided) activation, all of them with CSL and also large injury (extent of GM and WM lesion \u22652); and only 2 patients with small PVL had ipsilesional activation. \n\nPatients with left MCA infarction, i.e., CSL, demonstrated contralesional or bilateral activation and none of them had ipsilesional activation which is probably the result of the destruction of their primary language cortex, while patients with small PVL and preserved language cortex had ipsilesional activation. Therefore the dominant contralesional activation occurred only in patients with large CSL (extent of injury \u22652), and not with PVL, which supported the thesis that both the site and extent of a left hemispheric lesion determine the capacity for reorganization. Knecht and Lidzba and Lidzba et al., like us, reported a prevalence of greater right hemispheric language dominance in cortical lesions compared to PVL ( ,  ). \n\nRaja Beharelle et al. suggested that language reorganization depended more on the type rather than the size of lesion ( ). However, LI values were inversely correlated with severity of the lesion according to Chilosi et al.: in cortical and subcortical, but not in PVLs right hemisphere language dominance is significantly associated with more severe brain damage, and our results supported this conclusion ( ). \n\nAccording to some authors, lateralization of language areas should be regarded differentially according to the cortical regions: UCP patients with better language outcome show a functional organization for language that favors left over right activity in frontal brain regions and a bilateral pattern of activity in right and left temporal-parietal regions ( ). \n\nThe association between language and intellect is also discussed. Some researchers consider that the greater the shift to the right of language functions, the lower the cognitive and expressive language scores ( ,  ). However, we could not support these statements, because two of our patients with right-sided contralesional language activation had high IQ, 89 and 90, respectively, in contrast with the other two patients with bilateral activation with IQ, respectively, 50 and 60. According to our results the type of language reorganization does not predict the language outcome. Our study confirmed the thesis that atypical language lateralization (in terms of LIs) is not necessarily associated with impaired performance during experimental tasks ( \u2013 ). \n\n#### Reorganization According to Dyslexia \n  \nThe children with CP had poorer phonological processing abilities than controlled typical children ( ,  ), and these abilities correlate with their reading skills ( ,  ). Several studies point out that reading recognition and reading comprehension abilities are lower than verbal intelligence in patients with cerebral palsy, although there were some inconsistencies in the findings ( ,  ). In accordance with these data, five out of seven of our patients had dyslexia and three of them were with normal intelligence (IQ above 70). \n\nLanguage activation in adults with isolated dyslexia is slightly right lateralized, in contrast with typical readers with left-lateralized activation. This suggests that the activation in the right hemisphere in isolated dyslexic individuals is likely to be the cause rather than the consequence of reading impairment ( ). These speculations may be inferred to UCP patients with dyslexia, although the effect of the structural damage should not be underestimated. Accordingly, four out of five patients with dyslexia in our study had right hemispheric activation with or without left hemispheric activation during silent word generation task. \n\nFour out of five patients with CSL and one out of two patients with PVL had dyslexia, i.e., it could be suggested that left hemispheric lesion, especially including left frontal cortex could result in dyslexia. The left inferior frontal gyrus is associated not only with articulation but also is involved in phonological processing ( ). Activation in this area is positively correlated with reading ability ( ). \n\nDyslexia correlates to some extent with motor reorganization and performance in our patients as three out of five dyslexic patients had worse MACS grades (grade 2 and 3) and contralesional or bilateral activation during the motor task, while the two patients without dyslexia had better MACS grades (grade 1) and ipsilesional motor activation. \n\nThese results require further studies to clarify the relationship between dyslexia and the type and size of the lesion in left hemisphere. \n\n\n#### Limitations and Factors Influencing the Results \n  \nThe strongest limitation of the language fMRI task was the impossibility to evaluate the exact execution of the task by the participants inside the MRI, although all the participants were asked to reproduce verbally the task after the experiment. Silent, but not vocal, word generation is really important to the experiment in order to avoid activation in motor areas involved in language production. \n\nMany factors could influence the task performances, either related or unrelated directly to UCP. In terms of age, there is evidence in previous studies that left lateralization for language production gets stronger with age ( \u2013 ). This stronger shift to the left hemisphere occurs in healthy subjects in late childhood and adolescence and is independent of the region of interest used for calculation of LI (whole brain, prefrontal cortex, frontotemporal regions) ( ). Our study population, however, contains patients between age 11 and 29 and these age effects should be minimal or finalized. \n\nEpilepsy is a common comorbidity in patients with CP, as well as in our patient group (five of eight patients have epilepsy and are under medication). There are evidences that both epileptic activity and medication (especially carbamazepine) could influence cognition and cognitive and language representation in the brain ( \u2013 ). All five patients with epilepsy in our study had atypical language representation (bilateral or contralesional\u2014in the right hemisphere), so it could be speculated that factors playing a role in \u201cshifting\u201d of verbal production in the right hemisphere could be a result not only from the lesion itself, but also from other factors like epileptiform activity or antiepileptic drugs. The possible effects of epileptic activity on language representation was discussed by Lidzba et al., and a suggestion was made that evaluation of language production in nonepileptogenic lesions is somehow more reliable due to the lack of confounding effect of epileptic activity ( ). In larger sample study antiepileptic drugs and epileptiform activity could be evaluated as predictive or significant factors for language representation. \n\n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nDespite the limitations of the study (small sample, different type of brain lesions, some confounding factors), several conclusions could be made: \n  \n- Patients with small PVLs have ipsilesional representation of primary motor, sensory, and word generation function. This, however, does not strictly correlate with better outcome, especially in terms of language and cognition\u2014one of the patients has borderline IQ score and the other one is dyslexic, although with normal intelligence, but both had very good motor capacity and no sensory deficit. \n  \n- Patients with lesions involving left CSL regions show various models of reorganization in all three modalities (ipsilesional, contralesional, and bilateral) and different clinical outcomes that seem to be impossible for prediction. Anyway, there is a tendency of larger lesion being associated more frequently with motor and language shift to the contralesional hemisphere, and atypical location of primary sensory cortex. Patients with UCP who demonstrate ipsilesional motor cortical activation have better motor functional capacity. \n  \nAs this is a pilot study with only eight patients, the conclusions made are exploratory. Much larger sample and additional correlation with morphological data (volumetry, morphometry, tractography) is needed for determination of possible risk or protective factors that could play a role in the complex process of brain plasticity. Despite the mentioned limitations of the study, it is the first one that explores brain plasticity in three modalities at the same time with comparison to anatomical and clinical data. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nAll datasets generated for this study are included in the article. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Ethical committee of Medical University\u2013Plovdiv.

The early visual cortex and other brain areas (such as the prefrontal cortex) have been implicated in such perceptual learning effects, but the anatomical specificity within visual cortex and the relationship between sensory cortex and other brain areas has yet to be examined. Moreover, while variations in the schedule (rather than merely the amount) of exposure influence experience-dependent improvement in discrimination, the neural sequelae of exposure schedule have not been fully investigated. In an event-related fMRI study, participants were exposed to confusable pairs of faces, scenes and dot patterns, using either intermixed or blocked presentation schedules. Participants then performed same/different judgements with exposed and novel pairs of stimuli. Stimulus independent activation, which was correlated with experience-dependent improvement in discrimination, was seen in frontal areas (e.g. frontal and supplementary eye fields and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and in early visual cortex (V1-4). In all regions, the difference in activation between exposed and novel stimuli decreased as a function of the degree of discrimination improvement. Overall levels of BOLD activation differed across regions, consistent with the possibility that, as a consequence of experience, processing shifts from initial engagement of early visual regions to higher order visual areas. Similar relationships were observed when contrasting intermixed with blocked exposure, suggesting that the schedule of exposure primarily influences the degree of, rather than the mechanisms for, discrimination performance. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIt is well established that simply giving participants exposure to stimuli results in an improvement in the subsequent ability to discriminate between those stimuli (for reviews see  \u2013 ). This experience-dependent change in discriminability is one example of perceptual learning which Gibson defined as \u201cany relatively permanent and consistent change in the perception of a stimulus array, following practice or experience with this array\u201d (Gibson,  , p. 29; see also Goldstone,  , p. 585). Following Gibson, the study of experience-dependent changes in discriminability has been pursued in two partially independent traditions. One, influenced by an associative perspective, has focused on the role of stimulus comparison using analogous procedures in animals and humans, utilising a range of relatively complex stimuli (e.g., flavours  ,  ; faces  ; checkerboards  ,  ; visual scenes  ). The other, being generally characterized by the use of simpler stimuli within a psychophysical tradition, has demonstrated that perceptual learning can be specific to particular stimulus features (e.g., size  ; orientation  ; texture  ; retinotopic location  ; for reviews involving perceptual learning in other modalities, see  ,  ). In addition to the nature of the stimuli that are presented, it is also notable that experiments from the psychophysical tradition typically involve extended stimulus exposure and/or training over a period of hours or days, with feedback to the participant. Whereas those influenced by the associative tradition, (e.g.,  \u2013 ,  ), typically involve less extended exposure, without explicit feedback. Despite these apparent differences, results from both methodological backgrounds reveal the benefit of stimulus exposure on subsequent perception, and have proposed similar mechanisms to explain this learning  \u2013 ,  . For an extended analysis of these two traditions and the relationships and differences between them see Dwyer and Mundy  . \n\nWhile there has been little work on the brain correlates of experience-dependent improvements in discrimination from within an associative tradition, the stimulus specificity effects from within the psychophysical tradition  \u2013  are consistent with the view that perceptual learning is based upon changes in primary sensory cortex where receptive fields are relatively small and feature specific (but see,  \u2013 ). This view receives direct support from functional imaging studies that have implicated early visual regions in perceptual learning. For example, Schiltz and colleagues  , using PET, reported a reduction in activation in visual cortex following extended training with contrast discrimination. Similarly, Mukai and colleagues  , in an fMRI study, found a decrease in activity in the visual cortex after training with sinusoidal gratings (there were also changes in the activity of \u201cattentional\u201d regions such as frontal and supplementary eye-fields and dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex). In this latter study, participants who improved on the discrimination task (\u2018learners\u2019) showed a reduction in visual cortex activation (and areas belonging to the attentional network) that correlated with the magnitude of perceptual learning. In contrast, participants who failed to improve on the task (\u2018nonlearners\u2019) showed no changes in brain activation during learning. \n\nThe studies described above highlight a role for visual cortex in perceptual learning that is evident as reductions in activity after training (see also  ). However, other studies have observed increases in activity for exposed or trained stimuli versus novel stimuli (1 month training, low contrast patterns, early visual cortex increase  ; 24 hours training, texture discrimination, early visual cortex increase  ). The basis for these opposing changes in activation in the primary visual cortex after stimulus exposure is unclear. However, one potential explanation relies on the assumption that these studies have measured different regions in the visual cortex, which might differentially change as a consequence of experience. We investigated this explanation, in terms of anatomical specificity, by assessing different regions of visual cortex with retinotopic mapping, and examining whether or not any changes in activity therein relate to the degree of discrimination improvement produced by stimulus exposure (see  ). Moreover, as noted above associative and psychophysical investigations of perceptual learning typically differ with respect to the overall amount of exposure and the complexity of the stimuli. By using fMRI with relatively brief exposure to complex stimuli we will be able to assess whether the neural sequelae of this type of experience are related to discrimination improvement in the same way as with extended exposure to simple stimuli. \n\nA complimentary aim of this study was to examine the extent to which any changes (increases or decreases) in activation were related to stimulus familiarity   per se  . One simple explanation for perceptual learning, which stems from within an associative tradition, relies on the idea that it is a direct function of the frequency with which the stimuli are encountered (i.e., their familiarity  ,  ). However, this idea cannot explain the fact that different   schedules   of exposure (that match for the overall   amount   of exposure) result in differences in the improvement in discrimination. For example, Honey, Bateson and Horn ( ; see also  ) demonstrated that animals exposed to two stimuli in an intermixed fashion (i.e. A, A*, A, A*, \u2026) subsequently acquired a discrimination between them more readily than a second group of animals that received an equivalent amount of exposure to the stimuli but arranged in blocks (i.e. A, A, \u2026 A*, A*,). Such effects of exposure schedule have since been replicated in animal and human studies across a range of stimuli, demonstrating that the experience-dependent changes in discrimination cannot be solely a product of stimuli familiarity (for a recent review, see  ). The theoretical basis of such a scheduling effect remains a matter of debate (see below); and this debate is mirrored by the fact that we do not know whether the improvements in discrimination that are produced by different types of stimulus exposure are mediated by the same brain substrates. \n\nOne of the earliest theoretical accounts of perceptual learning, that anticipated the advantage of intermixed over blocked exposure, was provided by Gibson  ,  . She suggested that perceptual learning depends on the process of stimulus differentiation; more specifically, the effectiveness of the features that are unique to each of the exposed stimuli are enhanced relative to those features that are shared or common to both. More recently, we have suggested that this differentiation process might be understood in terms of the differential adaptation of stimulus-unique and stimulus-common features (e.g.  ,  ,  ; but see also  ,  ). Briefly, according to this analysis, the response to common elements will adapt more quickly than the response to unique features because the common features are present on every trial. This difference will result in the unique features being better attended to and processed and will, in turn, result in them being more readily integrated into a long-term representation of the stimulus. Although the evidence suggesting an interaction between adaptation and exposure-dependant improvements in discrimination in our studies is relatively indirect, there is now more direct evidence to support such an interaction from motion-direction discrimination tasks  . The fact that the schedule of exposure has an equivalent effect on the improvement in discrimination across a range of stimuli might be taken to imply that shared brain mechanisms are involved (see  ). Although some preliminary evidence suggests that common brain mechanisms are involved across different types of visual stimuli  , this study examined only two stimulus types (faces and checkerboards) and involved too few participants to afford a powerful analysis of brain-behaviour relationships. Thus, the final aim for the current study was to examine the extent to which improvements in discrimination involving different classes of visual stimulus is supported by shared brain mechanisms. \n\nTo summarise: The three main aims of this study were to: (i) use retinotopic mapping techniques to determine the involvement of sub-regions within the visual cortex in the discrimination improvement following brief exposure to complex stimuli; (ii) investigate whether the schedule of exposure affects the brain mechanisms recruited; and (iii) examine the extent to which the brain mechanisms (in visual cortex and elsewhere) recruited are common across different types of visual stimuli. The design of the study is summarized in  . It involved giving participants intermixed exposure to two pairs of similar stimuli and blocked exposure to a further two pairs. The effects of this unsupervised exposure training were tested by examining the ability to discriminate within the intermixed and blocked pairs, in comparison to the ability to discriminate within two novel pairs of stimuli. This procedure was repeated with dot stimuli, morphed faces and virtual reality scenes. MRI data acquisition was performed during the test phase with a retinotopic mapping sequence performed in a separate session. Contrasting intermixed exposure with novel stimuli provides an assessment of experience-dependent improvement in discrimination. In this case, the effect of experience is based upon a within-subjects comparison, but is evident as a difference in performance between stimuli (exposed and novel). Contrasting the improvement in discrimination between stimuli experienced in intermixed and blocked schedules assesses effects of experience over and above those that reflect mere familiarity. Comparison of the three types of stimuli (for both the intermixed vs novel, and intermixed vs blocked comparisons) assesses the degree to which the brain mechanisms recruited by experience are stimulus general. Finally, correlating the behavioural effects of stimulus exposure on test performance with the fMRI results allows assessment of the relationship between the degree of experience-dependent improvement in discrimination and key brain substrates. \n   Experimental design.        \n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSixteen right-handed healthy participants (10 male) were scanned. Participants ranged from 18 to 40 years old (mean\u200a=\u200a30.1 years) and all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. This work received ethical approval from the School of Psychology (Cardiff University) ethics committee. All participants gave informed, written consent and were paid for their participation. \n\n\n### Materials \n  \nDot patterns, faces and scenes were used in both the pre-exposure and discrimination conditions. A computer program, written in Visual Basic , was used to generate twelve pairs of confusable dot patterns. The program was constrained to create an initial random pattern of 11 dots. A second confusable pattern was made by making random adjustments to the location of 4 dots in the original image within a range of 50 pixels. The face stimuli were created using a morphing software package called Morpheus 1.85 (ACD Systems, Saanichiton, British Columbia, Canada) running on an IBM-compatible PC. Twelve face pairs (6 pairs of men and 6 pairs of women) were created by selecting exemplars that were close together on a morph continuum between photos of two different individuals. This process is reported in more detail in Mundy et al.  . The scene stimuli consisted of twelve pairs of computer-generated virtual rooms. The pairs of rooms were made confusable by creating each pair from the same prototype, but ensuring that within the pair there were differences in the size, orientation and/or location of one or more of the features of the room (e.g. a window, staircase, wall cavity). The rooms were created using a commercially available computer game (Deus Ex, Ion Storm L.P., Austin, TX, USA) and a freeware software editor (Deus Ex Software Development Kit v1112f). Further details on how both faces and scenes were presented on screen are identical to those reported in Mundy et al.  . An example of the stimuli used can be found in  . All stimuli were presented at the centre of the screen; the on-screen dimension of all images was 15\u00d712 degrees of visual angle (height \u00d7 width), with a fixation distance of 57 cm. Participants were asked to fixate centrally, aided by a crosshair presented during inter-trial intervals. Response times and accuracy were automatically recorded via button box in order that individual trials could be accurately classified for an event-related analysis of the fMRI data. \n   An example of the face-, dot-, and scene-pair stimuli used in the main experiment.  \nThe on-screen dimension of all images was 15\u00d712 degrees of visual angle (height \u00d7 width), with a fixation distance of 57 cm. The lower panel depicts the sequence of a single test trial. \n  \n\n### Experimental Design & Procedure \n  \nThe experimental design is summarized in  . This design was run six times, twice with each type of stimulus (dots, faces and scenes), with stimulus-type order counterbalanced across participants. This arrangement was split across two scanning acquisition runs, each containing one version of each stimulus type. The twelve stimulus pairs produced for each condition were therefore split into two batches of six stimulus pairs. The stimulus batch was changed between experiment repetitions and counterbalanced across participants so that all stimulus pairs appeared equally often in each condition (intermixed, blocked and novel). For each stimulus type, the experiment took place in two stages: \u2018exposure\u2019, where participants were given experience of some stimulus pairs; and \u2018test\u2019, where discrimination between the members of exposed and novel-at-test pairs was assessed. Before exposure, participants were given the following instructions: \u201cYou will now see a series of images, some will be very similar, please play close attention\u2013the differences are very subtle. Please try and keep your gaze to the centre of the screen (indicated by a crosshair)\u201d. During the exposure stage (given in the scanner but with no data acquired), participants were given exposure to pairs of stimuli in two exposure-schedule conditions. In the intermixed condition, the two images in a pair were presented in alternation. In the blocked condition, two pairs of items were presented, with all presentations of one image in the pair preceded by those of the second image in that pair. The order in which these within-subjects conditions were presented was counterbalanced across participants and runs. Each presented image was shown 5 times for 2 seconds each with a 1 second ISI. This amount of exposure produces differences in discrimination between exposed and novel stimuli and between stimuli presented on intermixed and clocked schedules (e.g.  ,  ,  ,  ). The remaining two pairs of items in each stimulus condition were only presented during the test stage of the experiment, and were thus \u2018novel\u2019 at the outset of testing. \n\nThe test phase, which immediately followed exposure, consisted of a same/different discrimination task in which two stimuli were presented in succession: on each trial they were either two copies of the same stimulus (i.e. A, A) or two different stimuli (from the same pair, i.e. A*, A) and the participants were requested to indicate if they were the same or not by pressing the relevant key of the response box. Participants saw the following instructions before the test phase commenced: \u201cYou will now see a second series of faces, some will be new. The image will flash\u2013please indicate whether you think the image has changed. Press the left button to indicate that you saw the images change (i.e., they were different). Press the right button to indicate that the images did not change (i.e., they were the same)\u201d. The first stimulus was shown for 500 ms, followed by a 300 ms ISI that was filled by a high contrast random mask image, and then the second stimulus was presented for 500 ms. The offset of the second stimulus triggered a 2-sec response window (when the screen was blank), followed by a random ITI of between 2.5 and 10 sec sampled from a Poisson distribution, during which time a central fixation cross was presented. The test phase was conducted with 16 trials for each stimulus-pair (8 same, 8 different). The order of trials was randomised with the constraint that there must be four trials from each condition in every 16 trials. After every 16 trials, a fixation cross appeared for 20 seconds to allow the participant to rest. Following the main experiment, each participant was given a high-resolution structural scan. Additionally, 12 of the 16 participants underwent a retinotopic mapping sequence (for details of this protocol, see  ,  ), undertaken in a second scanning session between 1 and 7 days later. The 4 participants who did not receive a retinotopic scan were unavailable to return for this second session. These participants were thus excluded from retinotopic analyses, but were included in all other analyses. \n\n\n### Data Acquisition \n  \nImaging was performed on a General Electric 3-T HDx MRI system using an 8-channel receive-only head coil. For functional imaging a T2*-weighted gradient-echo, echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence was used to image volumes with blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast. Fifty slices were collected per image volume covering the whole brain, prescribed 30 degrees inclined from the AC-PC plane. Scanning parameters were: repetition time/echo time (TR/TE) 3,000/35 ms; flip angle (FA) 90 degrees; slice thickness 2.8 mm (1 mm gap); acquisition matrix GE-EPI 64\u00d764; in-plane field of view 22 cm; ASSET (acceleration factor) 2. Additional high-resolution field maps were also acquired for every participant, for the purpose of un-distorting the EPI datasets during image pre-processing. For anatomic localization, a structural scan was made for each participant using a T1-weighted sequence (3D FSPGR). Scanning parameters were: TR/TE 7.9/3.0 ms; FA 20 degrees; acquisition matrix 256\u00d7256\u00d7176, field of view 256\u00d7256\u00d7176 mm, 1 mm isotropic resolution. \n\n\n### Data Pre-processing \n  \nData pre-processing and statistical analysis of fMRI data was carried out using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) Version 5.63, part of FSL (FMRIB\u2019s Software Library,  ). The following pre-statistics processing was applied; motion correction using MCFLIRT  ; non-brain removal using BET  ; spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 4 mm; mean-based intensity normalisation of all volumes by the same factor; highpass temporal filtering (Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting, with sigma\u200a=\u200a20.0 s); un-distorting the EPI data to correct for magnetic field distortions by means of individual fieldmaps. Time-series statistical analysis was carried out using FILM with local autocorrelation correction  . Registration to high resolution 3D anatomical T1 scans (per participant) and to a standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template image (for group average) were carried out using FLIRT  ,  . \n\n\n### Data Analysis \n  \n#### Behavioural Analysis \n  \nThe primary measure of performance was response accuracy (percentage of correct responses during discrimination testing). This was calculated on a within-subject basis as a function of exposure type (intermixed, blocked, novel) and stimulus type (faces, dots, scenes) averaged over both scanning runs. In order to assess any effects of the speed of responding (e.g., speed accuracy trade-offs), reaction times were also examined in the same manner. \n\n\n#### Imaging: General Group Analysis \n  \nAfter pre-processing each individual subject\u2019s fMRI time series, the data were submitted to a (random effects) general linear model, with one predictor that was convolved with a standard model of the haemodynamic response function (HRF) for each event-type/condition. Only data from the discrimination test phase were analysed: consequently, the event-types/regressors (a total of 9) were defined by the exposure history of each discrimination event (\u2018intermixed dots\u2019; \u2018blocked dots\u2019; \u2018novel dots\u2019; \u2018intermixed faces\u2019; \u2018blocked faces\u2019; \u2018novel faces\u2019; \u2018intermixed scenes\u2019; \u2018blocked scenes\u2019 and \u2018novel scenes\u2019). The parameter estimates relating to the height of the HRF response to each event-type were calculated on a voxel by voxel basis, via a multiple linear regression of the response time course, to create one beta image for each event-type per participant, per run. These parameter estimates, characterising the extent to which a region was activated by the event-type, were used as the basis for our analyses by including them in a higher-level (group) FLAME analysis (FMRIB\u2019s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects  ,  ). \n\n\n#### Planned data analyses \n  \nFirst, BOLD activity resulting from stimulus independent exposure learning was defined in a whole-brain analysis by contrasting intermixed stimuli (intermixed dots + intermixed faces + intermixed scenes) with novel-at-test stimuli (novel dots + novel faces + novel scenes), for each individual. Then, FEAT\u2019s (gaussianised)   t  -statistics were converted to   z   statistics and thresholded using clusters determined by   z  >3 and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   p  \u200a=\u200a0.05  . To test for any stimulus-specific effects, the same whole-brain analysis was then repeated for each of the stimulus types individually. To obtain a group average for each of these contrasts, the data were submitted to a further FLAME analysis. \n\nTo assess the contribution of distinct early visual regions to the effects of stimulus exposure, and to allow a more detailed assessment of which early visual areas may contribute to degree of learning, the individual retinotopic maps (N\u200a=\u200a12) were scrutinised to identify areas V1\u2013V4 in each hemisphere (see  ,  ). Since all stimuli were centrally presented, the centre of each region (close to the foveal representation) was identified by eye, according to careful analysis of the pattern of striation in each individual\u2019s retinotopic map. The map was represented as a cortical flatmap with areas of activity delineated by selectivity to visual field meridian. The voxel closest to this point was used to define the centre point for a subsequent manually defined region of interest (ROI) constructed from the set of contiguous voxels within 6 mm in the anterior/posterior, superior/inferior and medial/lateral direction of this co-ordinate. Where retinotopic regions were further sub-divided by the retinotopic map (i.e. V2dorsal/V2ventral, V3/V3a/V3b/Vp), ROIs were defined for each sub-division and data were later averaged across them. Voxel numbers in each ROI were matched. Using these retinotopic ROIs, each participant\u2019s individual data was queried to obtain a parameter estimate in each of the visual regions within the exposure contrast [intermixed stimuli versus novel stimuli] for each stimulus type, in each hemisphere. \n\nIn order to examine exposure effects in previously reported frontoparietal areas (e.g.,  ,  ,  ), and to evaluate those regions identified in our own whole-brain analyses, several candidate regions were defined anatomically in reference to the atlas of Talairach and Tournoux   in all 16 participants: intraparietal sulcus (IPS; Talairach coordinates x, y, z: \u00b126, \u221265, 39), frontal eye field (FEF; \u00b141, 2, 47), supplementary eye field (SEF; \u00b13, \u22121, 60), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; \u00b123, 42, 36). The subsequent ROI for each region was defined as the set of contiguous voxels that were within 6 mm in the anterior/posterior, superior/inferior and medial/lateral directions of voxel closest to the anatomical centre (i.e., a 3\u00d73\u00d73 voxel cube). The validity of such regions to areas of activity seen in our own whole-brain data was assured by cross-checking the proximity of the central voxel of these anatomically defined ROIs with the peak voxel of clusters identified within the above whole-brain analysis, to ensure good correspondence. A series of   t  -tests supported this correspondence, by indicating that anatomically defined regions did not differ significantly in any (x, y, z) direction (maximum   t   (15)\u200a=\u200a1.75,   p  >0.1) from significant clusters seen in group-average whole brain analyses. Using these anatomical ROIs, as before, each participant\u2019s individual data was queried to obtain a parameter estimate in each of these regions within the learning contrast [intermixed stimuli versus novel stimuli] for each stimulus type, in each hemisphere. \n\nIn order to investigate the possibility that activity in brain regions resulting from exposure to the stimuli might be modulated by individual differences in discrimination improvement, correlations between individual parameter estimates and a behavioural measure of discrimination improvement were made for each frontoparietal and visual ROI. The behavioural measure was defined as an individual\u2019s score on exposed intermixed discriminations minus their score on novel discriminations; thus a larger difference equates to greater improvement in stimulus discrimination (a greater benefit to performance of exposure compared to a no exposure baseline). For the subsequent analysis of the effect of exposure schedule on discrimination improvement (as opposed to the amount of exposure), the above methodology was repeated in full, replacing novel stimuli with blocked stimuli. In this way, all contrasts became a test of the sequence of presentation [intermixed stimuli versus blocked stimuli] rather than the amount of presentation (i.e., exposed versus novel). It should be noted that all these analyses make comparisons across different exposure conditions. We have already reported the results of an, entirely orthogonal, analysis based on differences within exposure conditions and stimulus-types  . \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioural Data \n  \n shows the discrimination scores for the nine conditions. Discriminations involving pairs of images that were exposed in an intermixed (and blocked) fashion were more accurate than those involving pairs of images that were novel. Similarly, intermixed exposure resulted in better performance than blocked. There was, however, little evidence of performance differences on discriminations across different stimuli type. Consistent with this description of the results, analysis of variance revealed a main effect of exposure condition (  F  (2, 30)\u200a=\u200a12.9,   p<  0.01), but no overall effect of stimulus category (  F  <1) and no interaction (  F  <1). Collapsing across stimuli, analysis of the simple main effects confirmed that performance in each of the two exposed conditions was better than in the novel condition (minimum   F  (1,15)\u200a=\u200a31.2,   p  <0.01), and that performance in the intermixed condition was more proficient than in the blocked condition (  F  (1,15)\u200a=\u200a14.9,   p  <0.01). Additionally, when the behavioural data were split, so that performance in the first half of the test phase was compared with performance in the second half (i.e., a broad examination of learning across test) ANOVA revealed a main effect of test phase (early vs late   F  (1, 15)\u200a=\u200a22.7,   p  <0.01), but this did not interact with exposure schedule (  F  <1). Investigating a comparable split half analysis in our imaging data was not possible due to lack of power for this kind of contrast, however given the behavioral data indicate no interaction between the main effects of test phase and schedule it would appear that the effects of exposure gained at test are simply added to the effects of the explicit manipulation of exposure in the previous stage of the experiments. \n   Mean discrimination performance (with SEM) as percentages correct.  \nScenes (black), face (stripe) and dots (white) refer to the nature of the stimulus, whilst Intermixed, Blocked and Novel refer to the exposure status. \n  \nMean reaction time data for this experiment can be found in  . ANOVA revealed no significant effect of exposure or stimuli type and no interaction (  Fs  <1). These behavioural results parallel those seen by Mundy et al.,  ,  ,  ,   and elsewhere (e.g.,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n   Behavioural reaction time data for each condition (seconds), with SEM.      \nThe behavioural data indicating the most marked improvement in discrimination involved the comparison of intermixed and novel stimuli. In order to gain the clearest picture of the brain effects of this experience-dependant improvement in discrimination we began by comparing these two conditions. Later, we turn to the comparison of the intermixed and blocked conditions. Whilst these analyses were the most appropriate for the questions at hand, there were several other potential comparisons: for example, intermixed and blocked conditions can be combined to create an \u2018exposed\u2019 condition, which can be contrasted with novel stimuli. This contrast will not be reported in detail, but it is worth noting that there were no significant differences in cortical regions activated, between this comparison and the intermixed versus novel comparison which we report in detail here. As will be described in detail below, with one exception, the general pattern of results from the intermixed versus novel comparison, and intermixed versus blocked comparison, was the same. \n\n\n### Imaging Data \n  \n#### Stimulus independent improvements in discrimination whole brain analysis: Intermixed stimuli versus novel stimuli \n  \nIn order to examine stimulus-independent improvements in discrimination, data from discriminations involving intermixed stimuli were contrasted with data from discriminations involving the novel stimuli, collapsed across stimulus type (see   and  ). This contrast revealed a significant area of activation in the occipital pole that extended into the medial inferior occipital gyrus and lingual gyrus (overlapping V1 and V2, according to the J\u00fclich histological atlas in FSL  ). The reverse contrast revealed significant clusters of activation in: lateral occipital and lingual gyri (overlapping V3 and V4); intraparietal sulcus; superior frontal gyrus (at the junction of the pre-central sulcus, encompassing the frontal eye field); mid frontal gyrus, extending to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; precuneus; and cingulate gyrus (extending to the upper part of the paracentral sulcus, containing the supplementary eye field). Subsequently, a conjunction analysis was performed in order to confirm that activity in these regions is truly stimulus-independent. Activity to each stimulus type was independently contrasted with baseline activity, resulting in three statistical masks (using a   p  <0.05 threshold within each analysis). Then, a conjunction mask was created by intersecting these three masks, identifying regions that were significantly activated by all three stimulus types (  p  <0.05, corrected for multiple comparsions). This conjunction analysis confirmed the above observations, indicating no differences in the areas reported above when directly comparing experience-dependant discrimination improvement across stimulus types (i.e., examining stimulus-selective processing), indicating these regions are stimulus-independent. However, it must also be noted that other brain regions, further along the ventral visual stream (known to be involved in exposure learning effects in a stimulus-specific way) differed when comparing stimulus types in the current data. For example, learning with face stimuli activated the fusiform gyrus and perirhinal cortex and scene stimuli activated the parahippocampal gyrus and posterior hippocampus. As we have discussed such activations elsewhere (see  ,  ), we will focus on purely stimulus-independent activity here. \n   Main effect of intermixed versus novel stimuli.  \nContrasts in a group analysis (n\u200a=\u200a16) were overlaid on the MNI-152 structural standard image. Effects were colour-coded such that intermixed > novel are in red-yellow and novel > intermixed are in blue-lightblue. \n     Clusters surviving a whole-brain correction at   P  <0.05.        \n\n#### Early visual activations assessed by retinotopic mapping \n  \n shows a retinotopic map for the right hemisphere of a representative participant. The hemisphere is shown with the cortical surface inflated. The most relevant visual sub-regions for this experiment are marked within  . Regions of interest were defined for each of these sub-regions in both hemispheres of every participant.   shows average beta difference scores (i.e., intermixed exposed activity minus activity to novel stimuli) for the exposure contrast in each of the main retinotopic regions, for each stimulus type (collapsed across hemisphere for clarity). Both V1 and V2 respond more to intermixed than novel conditions, whilst V3 and V4 show the opposite pattern. There appears to be no effect of stimulus type on activity in any of the regions. To check that these regions (and thus the relationship between activity and behaviour) were truly stimulus-independent and that there were no hemispheric differences in activity, the beta values [intermixed minus novel] for each early visual ROI were submitted to a three-way ANOVA with factors of hemisphere, subregion and stimulus-type. The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of sub-region (  F  (3, 33)\u200a=\u200a46.2,   p  <0.01), but no effects of stimulus-type or hemisphere or any interactions (  F  s<1). \n   A representative example of a retinotopic map (right hemisphere) from one participant.  \nRetinotopic map colour scheme represents cortical activity to stimuli in the Upper Vertical Meridian (UVM) in blue, through pink, into red coding for the Horizontal Meridian (HM), though yellow, into the Lower Vertical Meridian (LVM) in green. \n     A: The graph shows the activity (as a Parameter Estimate value, error bars represent 95% Confidence Interval) in early visual areas (V1\u2013V4).  \nActivity in V1/2 is significantly above parity between intermixed and novel conditions whereas activity in V3/4 is significantly below. The blue data represents dots, red data faces, green data scenes. B: Correlation between activity and behavioural performance (% difference intermixed discrimination minus novel discrimination) in each of the visual ROIs. C: Correlation between activity and behavioural performance (% difference intermixed discrimination minus novel discrimination) in visual attention related areas. Blue data represents intraparietal sulcus (IPS), red data frontal eye field (FEF), green data supplementary eye field (SEF) and purple data dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). D: Correlation between activity and behavioural performance defined by the difference in performance between exposure schedules (% difference intermixed discrimination minus blocked discrimination) in each of the visual ROIs. E: Correlation between activity and behavioural performance (% difference intermixed discrimination minus blocked discrimination) in visual attention related areas. Blue data represents intraparietal sulcus (IPS), red data frontal eye field (FEF), green data supplementary eye field (SEF) and purple data dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). \n  \n\n#### Stimulus independent activity correlated with behavioural performance \n  \nIn order to gain a better understanding of the activity associated with stimulus independent discrimination improvement, and to assess whether or not it varied according to individual behavioural performance, parameter estimates from the exposure contrast in frontoparietal and early visual regions of interest were correlated with behavioural performance: \n\n Early visual regions  .   shows a correlation between our behavioural measure (X-axis) and activity in each of the visual cortex sub-regions (V1\u2013V4; Y-axis). Inspection of the figure shows that differential exposure-related activity in all regions was negatively correlated with behavioural performance. The greater the difference between intermixed and novel discriminations, the less activity is seen in all measured regions of the visual cortex, albeit from different starting baselines. More specifically, V1 and V2 show greater activity to intermixed-exposed than novel stimuli for participants showing the lowest amount of discrimination improvement, but this activity difference reduces as the level of discrimination improvement increases. Areas V3 and V4 are not differentially activated for participants who show low levels of discrimination improvement, but decreased activity for intermixed-exposed compared with novel stimuli emerged as the level of discrimination improvement increased. Pearson correlations confirm this description of the results: V1,   r  \u200a=\u200a\u22120.607,   p  <0.05; V2,   r  \u200a=\u200a\u22120.748,   p  <0.01; V3,   r  \u200a=\u200a\u22120.754,   p  <0.01; V4,   r  \u200a=\u200a\u22120.685,   p  <0.05. To focus on the extremes of the discrimination improvement continuum, if a particular participant was showed only a small improvement in discrimination with exposure, they showed strong activation in V1/2 and little, if any reduction in activity in V3/4 when making discriminations about pre-exposed (versus novel) stimuli. In contrast, participants who displayed large improvements in discrimination with exposure tended to show little V1/2 activation and much greater reduction in activity in V3/4 when making equivalent discriminations. \n\n Frontoparietal regions.   Regions of interest were defined bilaterally for the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), frontal eye field (FEF), supplementary eye field (SEF) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; according to previously published co-ordinates and anatomical landmarks, in the manner described above; see  ). ANOVA confirmed there were no effects of stimulus-type or hemisphere in each of these regions (  F  s<1), indicating that activity in these areas is stimulus-independent. There was, however, a main effect of exposure [intermixed versus novel] (  F  (3,33)\u200a=\u200a43.9   p  <0.01). This main effect was supported by significant differences between novel and intermixed trials in each of the four ROIs (minimum   F  (1,15)\u200a=\u200a15.6   p  <0.01).   shows a correlation between our behavioural measure (accuracy on intermixed trials minus accuracy on novel trials) and activity (contrasting intermixed trials with novel trials) in each of the attention-related ROIs, collapsed across hemisphere. Inspection of the figure shows that all regions are negatively correlated with behavioural performance: The greater the difference between accuracy on exposed and non-exposed discriminations, the greater the reduction in activity is seen in all measured regions. Pearson correlation confirms this analysis: IPS,   r  \u200a=\u200a\u22120.684,   p  <0.05; FEF,   r  \u200a=\u200a\u22120.825,   p  <0.01; SEF,   r  \u200a=\u200a\u22120.692,   p  <0.05; DLPFC,   r  \u200a=\u200a\u22120.747,   p  <0.01. \n\n\n#### The effect of schedule on the neural correlates of discrimination improvement: Intermixed stimuli versus blocked stimuli \n  \nThe effect of schedule was assessed by contrasting intermixed exposed stimuli with blocked exposed stimuli (i.e., from trials where discrimination is based upon the same amount of exposure to the stimuli, but under differing schedules). This schedule contrast produced no extra areas of activity to the exposure contrast explained above. Both contrasts revealed broadly similar clusters over the whole brain analysis, albeit with lower   z   scores in the intermixed versus blocked compared to intermixed versus novel contrast. A small cluster of voxels in early visual cortex, however, failed to show activation in this schedule contrast, yet were activated in the exposure-based contrast above. \n\n Early visual regions  : Close inspection of the retinotopic mapping data revealed that this discrepancy appeared to be in areas V1 and V2. An ANOVA on the parameter estimates from each condition in each ROI with factors of contrast (exposure or schedule) and region (V1\u20134) revealed a main effect of region (  F  (3, 33)\u200a=\u200a12.44,   p  <0.01), contrast (  F  (1, 11)\u200a=\u200a18.91,   p  <0.01) and an interaction (  F  (3, 33)\u200a=\u200a8.35,   p  <0.01). Analysis of the simple effects of this interaction confirmed that in V3 and V4 there was no significant difference between exposure and schedule activity (largest   F\u200a=\u200a  1.70,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.218), whereas V1 and V2 activity differed significantly when comparing exposure and schedule (minimum   F  (2, 10)\u200a=\u200a9.73,   p  <0.01). \n\nA correlational analysis between behavioural performance and ROI-generated V1\u20134 parameter estimates (equivalent to the exposure-based analysis explained above and using identical ROI co-ordinates for each participant) was performed on the schedule data. Behavioural performance was measured, in this case, as the percentage difference between discrimination performance to previously intermixed stimuli and previously blocked stimuli. A large difference can be understood as a strong effect of exposure schedule on subsequent discrimination (i.e., a participant who benefits more from intermixed than blocked exposure, despite the equivalent amount of exposure to the stimuli). Parameter estimates were taken for each early-visual ROI from the image generated by contrasting all intermixed conditions (dots, faces and scenes) with all blocked conditions. Inspection of   indicates that whilst V3 and V4 show a negative relationship with behavioural performance (similar to that documented above), V1 and V2 do not; in fact there is instead a weak positive relationship (in contrast to the pattern shown above). Pearson correlations confirm this description of the results: V1,   r  \u200a=\u200a0.243,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.45; V2,   r  \u200a=\u200a0.321,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.31; V3,   r  \u200a=\u200a\u22120.794,   p  <0.01; V4,   r  \u200a=\u200a\u22120.609,   p  <0.05. Thus, for participants who only exhibited a small benefit of intermixed exposure over blocked exposure, at a behavioural level, there was no activation of V1/2 and only weak reductions in activity in V3/4. In contrast, for participants with a larger benefit of intermixed over blocked exposure there were greater reductions in V3/4 activity (i.e., intermixed < blocked), but still little difference in V1/2 activity levels. \n\n Frontoparietial regions:   Frontoparietal regions of interest, described above, were also directly assessed for schedule effects. ANOVA once again confirmed there were no effects of stimulus-type or hemisphere in each of these regions (largest   F  \u200a=\u200a1.40,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.291), indicating that schedule-related activity in these areas is stimulus-independent. A further ANOVA on the parameter estimates in each ROI, collapsed across stimulus type and hemisphere, with factors of contrast (exposure or schedule) and region (IPS; FEF; SEF; DLPFC) revealed no significant main effects, or interaction (largest   F  \u200a=\u200a1.92,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.146).   shows a correlation between behaviour (accuracy on intermixed trials minus accuracy on blocked trials) and activity (contrasting intermixed trials with blocked trials) in each of the attention-related ROIs, collapsed across hemisphere. Similarly to the effect of our exposure-based analysis above, inspection of the figure shows that all regions are negatively correlated with behavioural performance. Pearson correlation confirms this analysis: IPS,   r  \u200a=\u200a\u22120.606,   p  <0.05; FEF,   r  \u200a=\u200a\u22120.601,   p  <0.05; SEF,   r  \u200a=\u200a\u22120.670,   p  <0.01; DLPFC,   r  \u200a=\u200a\u22120.637,   p  <0.01. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAs noted in the  , perceptual learning refers to the influence of experience on discrimination and it has been investigated using a wide range of procedures. Both brief and extended exposure to visual stimuli improve later discrimination (i.e., produce a perceptual learning effect). One outstanding issue is whether brief and extended exposure to visual stimuli have the same neuronal sequelae. Here, our principle aim was to identify the contribution made by individual sub-regions within visual cortex (in particular V1-V4) to experience-dependent discrimination improvement, while also investigating a broader network of brain regions that might be important. FMRI was used to scan participants during discrimination judgements involving confusable stimulus-pairs of faces, scenes and dot patterns, which had either been exposed in intermixed or blocked schedules, or were initially novel during test. The experiment we report here uses considerably fewer exposure trials and more complex stimulus types than many previous studies that have reported effects of experience on activity within the visual cortex (e.g.,  \u2013 ). We will begin by discussing the implications for the understanding of perceptual learning of the stimulus-independent involvement of the visual cortex in discrimination improvement following the brief amount of exposure. We then consider the involvement of frontal/attentional areas, before moving to consider the effects of schedule, rather than amount, of exposure on discrimination improvement. \n\n### Early visual cortex and stimulus-independent discrimination improvement \n  \nDiscrimination improvement for all types of exposed stimuli \u2013 dot patterns, faces and scenes \u2013 was associated with a region of early visual cortex (c.f.  ). Examining the simple effect of exposure to stimuli, we found important differences in how visual sub-regions were recruited: with increases in activity in V1 and V2 (i.e., greater BOLD signal for stimuli exposed in an intermixed fashion compared with to novel stimuli) but a reduction in activity in V3 and V4 (i.e., greater BOLD signal for novel stimuli than the stimuli exposed intermixed). Activity in these regions showed a negative correlation with behavioural performance, albeit with different starting and finishing points. More specifically, there was more activity in V1 and V2 when participants showed a small degree of exposure-dependant improvement in discrimination (as measured by a small difference between accuracy on trials with intermixed and novel stimuli) and a greater reduction in activation in V3 and V4 when there was a significant benefit of exposure (as measured by a large difference between intermixed and novel trials). As will be discussed later, this pattern of results was, by and large, also apparent when the comparison was between stimuli that has been exposed on the same number of occasions, but according to different schedules (intermixed and blocked). \n\nExperience-related activation in early visual regions with complex stimuli has been reported previously  ,  , and the current study replicates this finding, demonstrating that this activity in these brain areas is not restricted to simple stimuli (e.g., sinusoidal gratings), extended exposure and/or supervision (e.g., feedback during learning  ). There have been reports of reductions in activation with learning (e.g.  \u2013 ), as well as other reports of increases in activation with learning (e.g.  ,  ,  ,  ). The current study confirms that both patterns of results can be seen in the same participants, while performing the same perceptual discriminations. Importantly, the two patterns occur in distinct regions. Although V1 and V2 are more active for group average data for exposed than novel stimuli, there are additional visual regions like V3 and V4 that show reduced activity for exposed stimuli. Closer analysis of this data reveals that while V1\u2013V4 all have the same relationship with changes in discrimination performance\u2013behavioural performance is negatively correlated with activity \u2013 the broad differences in activation profile reflect differential starting baselines. \n\nThe current data are broadly consistent with Mukai et al. ( , see also  ,  ,  ) who also demonstrated a clear relationship between activity in early visual and overall level of performance. Participants for whom there was evidence of learning showed greater activation in these early visual areas, with this pattern decreasing across training. By the end of training, this group showed less early visual cortex activation than the remaining participants who had shown no evidence of learning. The reduced activation in the participants that learned (compared with those who did not learn) is much like the negative correlations between activity and behavioural performance seen in the current experiment. Importantly, however, our data also indicate that visual sub-regions do not all show the same level of initial activity. So, another source of the discrepancies amongst previous studies is the level of behavioural performance: in situations where improvements in discrimination were limited increases in activation might be expected, whereas marked improvements might lead to decreases in activation. \n\nThe reason behind the initial difference in activity level between V1/2 and V3/4 is unclear, but the fact that the coding of information changes along the visual pathway provides some basis for speculation. For example, V1 and V2 code for local orientation of contours  , while V4 codes for local curvature and configuration of orientations, and higher areas (e.g., lateral occipital cortex) processing global configurations and shape  . Ahissar and Hochstein   propose that perceptual learning (and visual processing more generally) involves a flexible focus on which ever coding system might provide the highest signal to noise ratio for a given task. Combining these ideas leads to the suggestion that the stimuli in this experiment can be discriminated both in terms of very local features (e.g. the positioning of a single dot or orientation of a line in a scene) or by more complex (but still relatively local) features. Using the most simple/local coding system may be inefficient as it might require actively maintaining the representations of a multitude of simple features in order to ascertain if any of them change between images, and thus will have a low signal to noise ratio as most individual features do not actually change. Using the more complex coding system could be more efficient as it requires attending to fewer (but more complex) features, although it may not be the default system to use, particularly early on in learning. As the stimuli become more familiar, however, the visual system may swap from focusing on the coding systems used in V1/2 to those in V3/4, thus resulting in better performance overall. Finally, for this hypothesis to explain the different overall levels of activation across V1\u2013V4 requires the assumption that in V1/2 better performance involves more overall activation (possibly as the result of processing a large number of individual features) whilst in V3/4 it involves less overall activation (possibly by selectively tuning to the configurations relevant to the discrimination). However, whether such a mechanism precedes or results from feedback via stimulus-specific processing known to occur elsewhere in the brain, will be a topic for further experimentation. \n\n\n### Frontoparietal regions and attention \n  \nIn addition to visual areas, regions of frontal and parietal cortex associated with attentional processing were also involved in discrimination improvement independently of stimulus type. These areas were the intraparietal sulcus, frontal eye field, supplementary eye field (cortical areas known to be associated with modulating attentional signals; e.g.  \u2013 ) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (which plays an important role in the integration of sensory and mnemonic information and working memory; see for a review  ). These areas are strikingly similar to those found by Mukai et al.  , a study that used much simpler stimuli. Furthermore, like Mukai et al. the current study found that the degree of learning shown by an individual was negatively correlated with the level of activation seen in these attention-related areas of cortex. \n\nThe involvement of attention in perceptual learning (at least with very simple stimuli) has been noted before (e.g.,  ,  ). This involvement is consistent with Gibson\u2019s   interpretation of perceptual learning, who proposed that learning is brought about by \u2018guided exploratory activity\u2019 through peripheral attention, in order to reveal \u2018aspects of potential stimulation\u2019 (  pg., 63). These perspectives envisage a top-down influence whereby differences in processing at the level of sensory cortex can be attributed to attentional mechanisms. However, the observed attentional differences could also be a product of bottom-up processes. As discussed in more detail below, differential adaptation or habituation of common and unique elements supported by early sensory regions offers one means to direct attention to the features of the stimuli that are most useful for the discrimination (i.e., attention is drawn to the unique elements following habituation of common elements; e.g.,  ,  ,  ). Irrespective of the theoretical interpretation, the current data suggest that weakly learned stimuli place more demands on attentional regions than do better learned stimuli. Similarly, Mukai et al.,   shows that initial learning activated attentional regions far more than learning later on in testing. Whilst unable to differentiate between cause and consequence at present, this information reinforces both the general idea that attentional processes are involved in experience-dependent improvements in discrimination, and that attentional demands decrease as discrimination improves. \n\nFor reasons of clarity this paper has only focused on those areas traditionally associated with visual perceptual learning of simple stimuli (early visual cortex and frontal cortical regions involved in visual attention e.g., see  ). It is important to note, however, that in regions beyond those discussed here, stimulus type does indeed affect the location of neural activity, including in the extrastriate cortex and the medial temporal lobe  ,  . In this light it should be noted that no further relationships were found between cortical activity outside the early visual cortex and reported visual attention regions discussed here and our measures of discrimination (which make stimulus-independent comparisons between exposure conditions). That said, measures of accuracy   within   an exposure condition did relate to activity in stimulus-dependent effect in MTL regions, a pattern not seen in any other cortical region (including those reported here, see  ). \n\n\n### Manipulating exposure schedule \n  \nThus far we have concentrated on examining discrimination improvement as a function of the amount of exposure, by comparing both discrimination performance and brain activity linked to exposed stimuli or to a non-exposed novel baseline. However, as was noted in the  , it is also well established that the schedule of exposure is important \u2013 in particular, intermixed exposure schedules, which afford the opportunity to compare the to-be-discriminated stimuli, support more improvement in discrimination than do blocked schedules (e.g.,  ,  ,  ). As the amount of stimulus exposure is equivalent in intermixed and blocked exposure, any observed differences in behaviour cannot be attributed to the frequency of exposure to the stimuli (i.e., simple familiarity). However, it remains an open question as to whether the psychological mechanisms responsible for schedule effects differ from those supporting effects based on the amount of exposure. Indeed, the idea that perceptual learning reflects an interaction between differential adaptation to the common and unique features of exposed stimuli and the formation of enduring representations applies equally well to both schedule effects and simple exposure (e.g.  ,  ,  ). \n\nConsider the fact that during intermixed exposure the interval between presentations of the unique features of two similar stimuli is greater than between those of the common features (which both stimuli share, and thus are seen on each presentation). This difference in the patterning of exposure to the unique and common elements might be a particularly effective means of adapting or habituating the common features of the two stimuli, leaving the unique elements to become better represented and available to be learnt about subsequently. In other words, the operation of short-term adaptation/habituation processes has enduring repercussions for the attentional weighting given to the unique and common features (see also  ). For blocked, the intervals between features are the same for both unique and common features, so the relative timing cannot contribute to the degree of adaptation, but it remains the case that the features that are common to all stimuli will be encountered more often than features that are unique to one or other stimulus. Thus there are still grounds for the unique features to gain relatively greater weighting in the representation of the stimulus as a whole. Of course, novel stimuli afford neither the opportunity for adaptation to differentially-weight the attention to common and unique features, nor the chance to form an integrated representation of the stimulus as a whole at all. Thus, as well as explaining the effects of exposure schedule, our adaptation-based account also applies to the amount of exposure. In this light it is particularly interesting that the same cortical regions are active when contrasting intermixed stimuli with novel stimuli and when contrasting intermixed and blocked stimuli (excepting V1 and V2). Thus, it seems that the improvement in discrimination based on the amount of exposure to a stimulus is, for the most part, underpinned by the same neural processes as the more specific effect of the schedule of exposure. Of course, the existence of a common brain substrate need not indicate that a single cognitive mechanism underlies perceptual learning, and the lack of V1/2 differential activity following intermixed versus blocked exposure (and the presence of this activity when contrasting intermixed with novel stimuli), points to some level of divergence in brain processing. That said, a common mechanism underpinning effects of schedule and amount of exposure is not incompatible with the current data. Consider our previous speculation that V1/2 are initially involved in local, featural discriminations, but can be superseded once more complex configural information becomes available (perhaps from V3/4 or from upstream feedback via stimulus-specific perceptual processing in extrastriate or medial temporal lobe regions  ,  ). If these very simple features are present in all stimuli, and they differ only in their amount or location, then only the overall amount of exposure (and not the relative intervals) will produce differential adaptation. \n\nIn summary, there is a large degree of commonality between the brain regions recruited as a result of simple exposure, and those recruited by the difference in the schedule of that exposure. Taken alongside the fact that the behavioural effects of manipulating the amount and schedule of exposure are similar (they both produce an improvement in discrimination) suggests the nature of exposure primarily influences the degree rather than the quality or kind of learning. This is not to say that the amount of exposure is the sole determinant of perceptual learning (c.f.,  ) but rather that different schedules of exposure afford the involvement of the cognitive and brain mechanisms supporting perceptual learning to different degrees. \n\n\n\n## Summary and Conclusion \n  \nThe present study investigated the effects of stimulus exposure on the visual cortex and frontoparietal regions, both as a function of amount of exposure (intermixed vs novel), the schedule of exposure (intermixed vs blocked), and also of the type of stimulus (dots, faces, scenes). Experience-dependent changes in activity in early visual cortex was seen for all three types of visual stimuli, and was evident when both intermixed was contrasted with novel stimuli and when intermixed was contrasted with blocked exposure. Areas V1 and V2 were activated in participants showing limited exposure-dependent improvement in discrimination, but there was a decrease in this activity as the level of improvement increased. These relationships were only observed in response to the amount of exposure, but not the schedule of exposure. Relationships involving activity in other brain areas and the amount of improvement based upon exposure showed the same pattern though they were typically stronger for the intermixed/novel contrast than the intermixed/blocked contrast. Areas V3 and V4 were not activated in participants showing weak experience-dependent improvements in discrimination, but became progressively deactivated as the level of such improvement increased. Areas known to be involved in visual attention (e.g., IPS, FEF, SEF) were also shown to have a similar relationship with behavioural performance, supporting the suggestion (see  ,  ) that changes in attention contribute to perceptual learning. Moreover, the similarity between the neural signature of experience-dependent improvements in discrimination based on the amount and schedule of exposure suggests that the two manipulations have their effects through a shared mechanism. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0101011-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nCondition\tExposure\tDiscrimination\nIntermixed\tA, A*, A, A*, A, A*, A, A*, A, A*,\tA versus A*\n\tB, B*, B, B*, B, B*, B, B*, B, B*\tB versus B*\nBlocked\tC, C, C, C, C, C*, C*, C*, C*, C*,\tC versus C*\n\tD, D, D, D, D, D*, D*, D*, D*, D*\tD versus D*\nControl\tNo Exposure\tE versus E*/F versus F*\n### Caption\nExperimental design.\n### Footer\nNote: A/A* to E/E* represent pairs of difficult to discriminate stimuli.

Since iron is involved in several processes including myelination, dopamine neurotransmission and neuronal metabolism, the presence of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in infancy relates to long-lasting neurofunctional effects. There is scarce data regarding whether these effects would extend to former iron deficient anemic human adults. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a novel technique to explore patterns of functional connectivity. Default Mode Network (DMN), one of the resting state networks, is deeply involved in memory, social cognition and self-referential processes. The four core regions consistently identified in the DMN are the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex and left and right inferior parietal cortex. Therefore to investigate the DMN in former iron deficient anemic adults is a particularly useful approach to elucidate de long term effects on functional brain. We conducted this research to explore the connection between IDA in infancy and altered patterns of resting state brain functional networks in young adults. Resting-state fMRI studies were performed to 31 participants that belong to a follow-up study since infancy. Of them, 14 participants were former iron deficient anemic in infancy and 17 were controls, with mean age of 21.5 years (\u00b11.5) and 54.8% were males. Resting-state fMRI protocol was used and the data was analyzed using the seed based connectivity statistical analysis to assess the DMN. We found that compared to controls, former iron deficient anemic subjects showed posterior DMN decreased connectivity to the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), whereas they exhibited increased anterior DMN connectivity to the right PCC. Differences between groups were also apparent in the left medial frontal gyrus, with former iron deficient anemic participants having increased connectivity with areas included in DMN and dorsal attention networks. These preliminary results suggest different patterns of functional connectivity between former iron deficient anemic and control young adults. Indeed, IDA in infancy, a common nutritional problem among human infants, may turn out to be important for understanding the mechanisms of cognitive alterations, common in adulthood. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIron deficiency anemia (IDA) continues to be the world most prevalent micronutrient deficit. Its frequency is greater in children and pregnant women and can affect up to 70% of population in many countries, particularly economically developing countries (Swaminathan et al.,  ). Even in developed countries, the prevalence of IDA in children can be as high as 4% (J\u00e1uregui-Lobera,  ). In Chile, until as late as 1999, about 30% of the children under 2 years of age presented with IDA, often as a result of poor maternal health condition or poor dietary intake. Public health policies of \u201c  fortification\u201d   such as availability of formula milk at government health centers, caused prevalence of IDA in infants under 18 months of age to drop to 10% in a period of 10 years (Brito et al.,  ). Although the decreasing incidence is promising, it should be emphasized that iron is an important nutrient for brain development, and the impact of IDA in infancy development, even after iron therapy is of clinical relevance. Therefore, understanding the neural mechanisms through which the developing brain is coping with a nutrient deficiency may help improve therapeutic strategies aimed at optimizing brain functional integrity. \n\nStudies using rodent models indicate that early IDA modifies myelin protein profile, specifically the proteolipid protein and MBP 21 (myelin basic protein), both of them required for myelin compaction (Ortiz et al.,  ). Further, alteration in genes regulating dendritic morphology appears to alter experience-depending brain synaptic plasticity, derailing thus memory, learning and other developmental milestones (Georgieff,  ). \n\nIn line with these results, there is mounting evidence that IDA in human infants is associated with long-lasting negative outcomes on several neurofunctional and cognitive domains, extending into adolescence (Algar\u00edn et al.,  ). We have shown that children who were properly treated for IDA during infancy, had delayed latencies in auditory and visual evoked potentials at preschool age. This slower neuronal transmission in both sensory systems is consistent with an impaired myelination process (Algar\u00edn et al.,  ). \n\nAnimal models have shown that early iron deficiency modifies the dopaminergic neurotransmission system, altering the functioning of the hippocampus and frontal cortex, among other brain regions (Beard and Connor,  ). Moreover in rats, dopamine synaptic connections develop quickly during the first 15 days of post-natal life; iron deficiency throughout this period would likely influence these synaptic connections (Ward et al.,  ). Dopaminergic neurotransmission system is critically involved in executive functions which encompass a heterogeneous repertoire of abilities related to monitoring and controlling thought and action, including self-regulation, inhibitory motor, cognitive control, planning future actions, attentional flexibility and error detection and correction capacity, among others (Prencipe et al.,  ; Lantrip et al.,  ). These higher cognitive functions have been well studied in humans using both event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). \n\nUsing ERPs, measure brain electrical activity when a subject performs a task, we found that at 10 years of age, former IDA (FIDA) children exhibited longer reaction time and lower P300 amplitude in the Go/No-Go task, which evaluates inhibitory motor control (Algar\u00edn et al.,  ). These results are consistent with subsequent research using a recognition memory paradigm (also at 10 years of age) that found slower reaction time and smaller ERP response to new/old tasks with an almost equal level of performance accuracy, suggesting that the effects of IDA in infancy persisted into late childhood despite apparently normal behavior (Congdon et al.,  ). \n\nNeurophysiological and imaging assessments are complementary methods for the study of brain functions. There has been much progress regarding typical and atypical human brain activities at the group level using fMRI and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI; Dosenbach et al.,  ). Resting state networks (RSN) are defined by a set of functionally interacting spatially distant regions at rest (Biswal,  ). The networks are known to be organized in different functional systems that correlate to behavioral performance, allowing for further understanding of the significance of functional connectivity. Several studies on the developing brain show that the extent of brain regions exhibiting resting state functional connectivity increases from 2 weeks of age up to 2 years old (Lin et al.,  ). Fair et al. ( ) showed that functional connectivity between ventro-medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) differs among children, adolescents and young adults, whereas, regions involved with motor and conflict monitoring differs little throughout these periods. These results indicate that the motor system and goal directed behavior develop earlier than other cognitive systems. A recent report from Marek et al. ( ) showed that network connectivity decreases in early adolescence (13\u201315 years) and then increases from late adolescence to adulthood, with the exception of the link between two of the most recognized networks, the Default Mode Network (DMN) and fronto-parietal network. \n\nAn important characteristic regarding the RSN, is the strength of the correlation between functional and structural connectivity. From rodent model, the results of the study conducted by H\u00fcbner et al. ( ) inducing brain demyelination, showed that functional connectivity was also altered, and the areas most affected were the posterior centers of DMN. In humans, myelination and functional connectivity develop parallel from birth until late adolescence (Stevens et al.,  ). Greicius et al. ( ) showed that there was not functional connectivity between hemispheres in absence of corpus callosum, reinforcing the concept that structural neural connections are required for functional connectivity. This hypothesis is further supported by studies showing that the strength of functional and structural connectivity is correlated in both healthy and patients with cognitive dysfunction (Hagmann et al.,  ). As an example, clinical evidence of the interaction between myelin disorder and functional connectivity alteration has been reported in patients with Multiple Sclerosis; subjects with an active lesion have increased functional connectivity that might be secondary to a compensatory mechanism for limiting and repairing the injury (Droby et al.,  ). \n\nAlthough there is some data regarding long-lasting cognitive effects in FIDA human adults (Lukowski et al.,  ), to our knowledge, there are no studies using rs-fMRI studies. Given that the DMN is a core brain network, the assessment of DMN in FIDA adults is particularly imperative in order to understand the long-lasting effects of IDA in infancy on neural functioning in adulthood. To achieve this, we used resting state fMRI to compare baseline whole-brain connectivity in both groups. We hypothesized that FIDA participants will present altered brain networks connectivity relative to control participants. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nParticipants were part of a longitudinal cohort study, which began recruitment in 1990 in order to conduct research on the behavioral, neuro-functional development and sleep-wake patterns effects of IDA in infancy. Six cognitive follow-ups were conducted at 12 and 18 months, 3, 5, 10 and 16 years old. The follow-ups included, among other measurements, cognitive assessment, academic achievements, socioeconomical and nutritional status. In brief, inclusion criteria were healthy full-term infants with birth weights \u22653.0 kg, no perinatal complications, and no acute or chronic illnesses. Infants were assessed for IDA at 6, 12 and 18 months. Anemia was defined as venous hemoglobin \u2264100 g/L at 6 months and <110 g/L at 12 and 18 months. Iron deficiency was defined as at least two out of three iron measures in the iron-deficient range (mean cell volume <70 fl, erythrocyte protoporphyrin >100 \u03bcg/dL red blood cells [1.77 \u03bcmol/L], serum ferritin <12 \u03bcg/L). For each IDA infant, a non-anemic (venous hemoglobin \u2265115 g/L) infant of the same age was randomly selected, constituting the \u201ccontrol group\u201d. After initial testing, all infants were given supplemental iron for 6\u201312 months (Lozoff et al.,  ). No participant presented IDA thereafter. \n\nIn year 2014, all the cohort members who participated in the previous follow-ups and were approximately 22 years old were invited to perform a brain magnetic resonance. The present study involved 31 healthy young adult participants (17 controls and 14 FIDA) with a mean age of 21.5 years (\u00b11.5 years), and 55% were male. \n\nFor current and background characteristics of the subjects we compared the Graffar scale (socio-ecomomical status; Richaud et al.,  ), performed the Spanish version of Manual for the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI \u201cSelf-Evaluation Questionnaire\u201d; Guill\u00e9n-Riquelme and Buela-Casal,  ), and established current occupation (employee, studying or unemployed). \n\nThe research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology (INTA), University of Chile, Santiago, and the Office of Protection from Research Risks, NIH. Participants signed an informed consent. \n\n### Imaging Parameters \n  \nfMRI was performed using Siemens Magnetom Skyra 3T scanner with parameters at TR = 2000 ms, TE = 35 ms with 16, 7.040-mm slices, 1-mm slice gap, and an in-plane resolution of 2.553 \u00d7 2.553 mm . Total of 200 time points were collected for every subject. For the anatomical T1 scan, imaging was performed on the same scanner with TR = 20 ms, TE = 4.92 ms with 303 slices and field of view (FOV) of 192 \u00d7 499 mm . \n\n\n### Preprocessing \n  \nFor all participants functional and anatomical image preprocessing was performed using statistical parametric mapping software (SPM 8 implemented using Matlab R2012b). After manually performing anterior commissure alignment for each participant, a realignment step was accomplished to correct for head motion. During this step, all scans of the participant were realigned to their first scan of the first session. The details of the transformation in six directions (  x  ,   y  ,   z  , roll, pitch and yaw) were stored as translation and rotation parameters. All participants were within the acceptable head motion range (less than 2 mm). After realignment, functional images were co-registered to the anatomical image (T1-weighted image) of that participant. Following successful co-registration of anatomical and functional images, segmentation was performed with SPM8 toolbox, and a probability map of gray matter, white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained. Simultaneously, a field vector storing information on the transformation from native subject space to standard template (Montreal Neurologic Institute, MNI template) was calculated. For each participant, the functional image was transformed to MNI space based on the deformation field and re-sampled to 3 mm isotropic voxel size. A binary mask of WM and CSF was created when a threshold for the WM/CSF maps obtained from segmentation step at   p   > 0.98 was applied (Biswal et al.,  ). In order to remove the confounding effects of WM, CSF and head motion, they were included as nuisance variables in linear regression model. The nuisance variable for linear regression included five principal components of WM and CSF obtained from WM and CSF masks. The regression input also included six time series describing head motion in six directions, six time series describing head motion in previous time points and 12 time series describing quadratics of motion. The residual of linear regression was temporally bandpass filtered at 0.01\u20130.1 Hz and spatially smoothened using a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half maximum. This filtered and smoothened data was used for further analysis. Acquisition, processing and analysis were performed to whole brain. \n\n\n### Seed Based Connectivity \n  \nTo analyze the intrinsic functional connectivity of PCC with the whole brain, two spheres of 5 mm radius was generated and used as a seed for left and right PCC seeds using MNI coordinates. RSN were obtained from coherent fluctuations of 0.01\u20130.1 Hz frequency occurring at spatially distinct regions through underlying monosynaptic or polysynaptic anatomical connections. Therefore, such RSN can be derived using any seed within a network. Seeds of 5 mm radius were also generated for left and right medial frontal gyrus (MFG), another major component of DMN. For all four seeds, the average blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series was calculated for each seed region and a whole brain voxel wise Pearson\u2019s r correlation was performed for each subject. Subject level correlation maps were later converted to z-maps using r-z Fisher transformation. \n\n\n### Regions of Interest (ROI)-Based Connectivity \n  \nIn addition to seed based correlation of the PCC and MFG, a total of 160 regions of interests (ROIs) were created based on the list defined by Dosenbach et al. ( ). All ROIs were sorted based on RSN\u2019s: 1. Cerebellar, 2. Cingulo-Opercular, 3. Default mode, 4. Fronto-Parietal, 5. Occipital, and 6. Sensoriomotor networks. Using the predefined MNI coordinates, a 5 mm radius sphere was created surrounding the peak voxel sampled at the same voxel dimensions of participants BOLD fMRI image. Nine ROIs were discarded as they were not within the brain mask of at least one subject. Using the remaining 151 ROI as mask, an average BOLD signal for each ROI was calculated for all participants. Pearson\u2019s r correlations were calculated between the BOLD signals of each ROI with remaining ROI. Hence a 151*151 correlation matrix was generated for each participant. Each 151*151 correlation matrix was transformed into Z-matrices using Fisher\u2019s r-z transformation. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \n#### Seed Based analysis \n  \nThe z-maps were concatenated to create two 4D functional z-maps, one for each group. An unpaired two-sample two tailed   t  -test was performed on the 4D inputs with gender as covariate using Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library randomized implementation. All statistical comparisons were performed only for voxels that were present across all subjects. Further, Monte-Carlo simulation was implemented to perform cluster based thresholding on the uncorrected voxel-wise p-maps to correct for multiple comparison problem. \n\n\n#### ROI Based Connectivity \n  \nAn independent sample   t  -test was performed on the ROI pairs to compare the connectivity between FIDA and control groups at   p   < 0.001. Due to the small sample size, the statistical threshold was set to lenient with no additional correction for multiple comparison problems. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nControl and FIDA groups were similar in current characteristics, including socioeconomic status, emotion scales and gender (Table  ). \n  \n Characteristics of Control and FIDA groups  . \n  \n Abbreviations: FIDA, former iron-deficiency anemia; STAI, state-trait anxiety inventory.

Randomization method performed on both left and right PCC z-maps resulted in voxel-based p-maps for contrast 1) Control > FIDA and 2) FIDA > Control. P-maps of right PCC thresholded at   p   < 0.02 with Monte Carlo cluster size = 38.9 voxels resulted in two clusters greater in Control (Figure   and Table  ) and one cluster greater in FIDA (Figure   and Table  ) participants. Similarly, randomization results of left PCC threshold at   p   < 0.02 with Monte Carlo cluster size = 40.3 voxels resulted in five clusters greater in Controls and no clusters greater in FIDA (Figure   and Table  ). Regions showing decreased connectivity to left and right PCC in FIDA group included regions of posterior DMN such as cuneus, PCC, parahippocampal gyrus, medial temporal gyrus and lingual gyrus. In contrast, regions presenting increased connectivity to right PCC in FIDA group included regions of anterior DMN and anterior cingulate cortex. \n  \n Right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) connectivity in Controls  .

Randomization method performed on both left and right MFG z-maps resulted in voxel-based p-maps for contrasts 1) Control > FIDA and 2) FIDA> Control. P-maps of both left and right MFG in the contrast Control > FIDA were not statistically significant after Monte Carlo cluster thresholding at   p   < 0.02. However, the FIDA > Control contrast condition of left MFG threshold at   p   < 0.02 with Monte Carlo cluster size = 38.3 voxels resulted in nine clusters greater in FIDA. The regions exhibiting increased connectivity to left MFG in FIDA group included DMN and dorsal attention networks. The list of regions and their coordinates mainly includes the intraparietal lobule and precuneus (Table   and Figure  ). \n  \n Connectivity to left medial frontal gyrus (MFG) in FIDA group  . \n  \n List of clusters with significantly greater connectivity to left medial frontal gyrus (+6, \u221247, \u22125) in FIDA group at voxel wise threshold   p   < 0.02 with multiple comparisons correction using cluster threshold = 39.4 voxels.

Based on the connectivity matrix, FIDA participants presented a scattered decrease in negative connectivity between Cingulo-opercular, Fronto-parietal and Sensory motor networks with DMN, and decrease in positive connectivity within DMN network. Otherwise, they exhibited a sparse increase in positive connectivity within Cingulo-opercular and Fronto-parietal networks (Figure  ). \n  \n Mean connectivity matrix  .

Vertical and horizontal partitions represent functional connectivity networks. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThese preliminary findings based on specific rs-fMRI assessments suggest different patterns of functional connectivity between FIDA and control young adults. \n\nSeed based connectivity results show that FIDA participants have decreased connectivity of the left PCC with posterior DMN regions, relative to control participants. The PCC is a highly connected and metabolically active brain region and a component of several RSN. The link between PCC and DMN is of particular importance due to the possibility of the PCC\u2019s role as a \u201chub\u201d interacting with multiple brain networks to allocate cognitive resources to different tasks (Leech and Sharp,  ). \n\nOur findings are reminiscent of DMN patterns observed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, as Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, multiple sclerosis, autism and Parkinson disease (Sandrone and Catani,  ). In fact, DMN regions showing decreased connectivity to left and right PCC in FIDA group included regions of posterior DMN such as cuneus, PCC, and parahippocampal gyrus, is also found in a majority of patients with Alzheimer disease and other types of dementia (Chhatwal et al.,  ). \n\nFurthermore, several studies of subjects at high risk for these disorders, including healthy relatives of patients with late onset of Alzheimer disease, have demonstrated that DMN patterns, particularly PCC and medial temporal cortex changes, are present before the disorder\u2019s onset and could even early marker of the disease (Wang et al.,  ). For instance, a study in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease showed alterations in DMN connectivity in both symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of pathogenic mutations, with a higher connectivity decrease in symptomatic carriers. Of note, subtle decreases in DMN connectivity were observable before symptom onset (Chhatwal et al.,  ). \n\nOtherwise from the field of cognitive development, individuals with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder\u2014a condition related to impairment of dopamine neurotransmission system\u2014are characterized by a decreased connectivity between precuneus and other DMN components (Somandepalli et al.,  ), and a negative relationship between the activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and DMN (Castellanos et al.,  ). Correspondingly, studies in patients with schizophrenia, another illness associated with an alteration in the dopamine system, show decreased strength in DMN nodes connectivity, suggesting that these patterns could underlie symptoms such as impaired self-awareness (Dodell-Feder et al.,  ). A recent study in healthy subjects compared the neurological soft signs (NSS) score and the grade of connectivity among cortical and subcortical areas related to motor function. The results showed a negative correlation between NSS score (lower score means better performance) and resting state-activity of right posterior cingulate. NSS have been found in psychiatric disorders of neurodevelopmental origin such as schizophrenia, autism and borderline personality, among others conditions that involve dopamine and myelin alterations (Thomann et al.,  ). \n\nThroughout brain development network properties increase integration and decrease segregation, thus WM maturation might play an important role in circuit formation or changes in their strengths (Hagmann et al.,  ). There are several studies showing a close relationship and a highly complex interaction between structural connectivity (myelin tracts) and functional connectivity (Greicius et al.,  ). Based on these results we speculate that a derailment in myelination process may reshape the connectivity map and explain in part, our finding of a connectivity absence in the posterior region of DMN in FIDA participants. \n\nThe effects of IDA in infancy on dopamine neurotransmission system could be explore assessing the executive functions, i.e., inhibitory control, set-shifting and planning, high cognitive abilities that relies on the integrity of frontostriatal circuits, in which the dopaminergic system plays a key role. At 10 years old, FIDA participants from our longitudinal study, showed a mild impairment performing an inhibitory motor task (Algar\u00edn et al.,  ). A follow-up study performed in Costa Rica indicated that FIDA at 19 years presented greater difficulty performing executive functions test (Lukowski et al.,  ). In the present study at 22 years old, a decreased DMN connectivity characterized FIDA subjects. Therefore, it is reasonable to argue that different DMN patterns in FIDA young adults might also refer to a dopaminergic dysregulation. \n\nThe MFG\u2014another key node of DMN (Passow et al.,  )\u2014is involved in decision making and reasoning processes (Talati and Hirsch,  ). In the present study the FIDA group demonstrated increased connectivity to the left MFG including DMN and dorsal attention networks, primarily included intraparietal lobule and precuneus. Sang et al. ( ) reported greater nodal centrality in MFG and parietal lobule regions in patients with Parkinson disease and proposed that these areas are highly connected to compensate for deficits caused by the disease. \n\nGiven that we did not perform a task based fMRI, it is not possible to determine whether the increased connectivity between brain circuits at rest relates to a decreased activation or suppression of DMN during tasks requiring higher cognitive resources. However, we could suggest that differences in intrinsic functional organization in the resting state, may contribute to change the interactions among specific brain regions while performing a task. \n\nFinally, a recent study in preschool age children showed that early life stressful events are associated with greater activity of rs-fMRI in left middle frontal gyrus, independent of other variables as poverty, violence exposure and exposure to a traumatic event (Demir-Lira et al.,  ). These results provide further support for the hypothesis that environment factors like micronutrient deficits (IDA), could generate persistent effects on neurofunctional domains, including resting state connectivity, more than 20 years after the nutritional insult (Lozoff et al.,  ). \n\nAn important limitation for the interpretation of the results is the lower spatial resolution of axial slicing of rs-fMRI and the small sample size. Notwithstanding, differences in brain connectivity between groups in specific regions were significant. The correlation analysis among connectivity results and behavioral tasks are not presented in this manuscript. Given the small sample size, one of our goals is to increase the number of participants to correlate rs-fMRI findings with behavioral results in future studies. \n\nIn conclusion, the results of the rs-fMRI study show altered brain connectivity patterns in otherwise healthy FIDA young adults. Based on the hypothesis of long-lasting effects of IDA in infancy on myelination and dopaminergic system functioning, it should be possible to design studies with specific fMRI imaging measures known to depend on these systems and processes. Whether altered brain connectivity in FIDA participants influences the progression of specific cognitive functions and neurodegenerative diseases with advancing age is part of our ongoing research challenges. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nCA conceptualized and designed the study, drafted the initial manuscript, and participated in critical revision of the manuscript.

{"text": "Geers, Laurie and Pesenti, Mauro and Derosiere, Gerard and Duque, Julie and Dricot, Laurence and Andres, Michael\nSci Rep, 2021\n\n# Title\n\nRole of the fronto-parietal cortex in prospective action judgments\n\n# Keywords\n\nCognitive neuroscience\nHuman behaviour\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nProspective judgments about one\u2019s capability to perform an action are assumed to involve mental simulation of the action. Previous studies of motor imagery suggest this simulation is supported by a large fronto-parietal network including the motor system. Experiment 1 used fMRI to assess the contribution of this fronto-parietal network to judgments about one\u2019s capacity to grasp objects of different sizes between index and thumb. The neural network underlying prospective graspability judgments overlapped the fronto-parietal network involved in explicit motor imagery of grasping. However, shared areas were located in the right hemisphere, outside the motor cortex, and were also activated during perceptual length judgments, suggesting a contribution to object size estimate rather than motor simulation. Experiment 2 used TMS over the motor cortex to probe transient excitability changes undetected with fMRI. Results show that graspability judgments elicited a selective increase of excitability in the thumb and index muscles, which was maximal before the object display and intermediate during the judgment. Together, these findings suggest that prospective action judgments do not rely on the motor system to simulate the action per se but to refresh the memory of one\u2019s maximal grip aperture and facilitate its comparison with object size in right fronto-parietal areas. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe capacity to imagine the progression of an action, before it is eventually executed, is a fundamental aspect of adaptive behavior. For example, anticipating a failure to grasp an object because it is too large will enable the implementation of motor adaptations facilitating the action, such as using two hands. It is commonly assumed that such prospective action judgments require the actor to compare the characteristics of the object to their body capabilities . In the particular case of graspability judgments (i.e., judging whether one would be capable to grasp an object), this implies to compare object size to maximal achievable grip aperture. In a seminal paper , Johnson went one step further by assuming that this comparison is preceded by the mental simulation of the reach and grasp movement. This simulation would recruit the same processes as those involved in action planning and execution, namely encoding the visual properties of the object (e.g., the size and orientation), activating the sensorimotor representation of the effectors (e.g., the hand), and computing the visuo-motor transformations required to achieve the action given a set of biomechanical rules . This view has been endorsed by other authors and has become very popular with the emergence of embodied accounts of cognitive judgments . \n\nResults of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are often taken as evidence that prospective action judgments involve motor simulation . Existing data indeed suggest that prospective action judgments involve the same fronto-parietal regions as those involved in explicit simulation or execution of an action, including areas within the anterior part of the intraparietal sulcus [aIPS], the ventral and dorsal premotor cortex [PMv, PMd], and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . However, the precise overlap between prospective action judgments and motor imagery has never been directly measured in previous fMRI studies, leaving the question of a possible common neural substrate unsolved. Moreover, some regions within this fronto-parietal network (in particular the aIPS) have also been associated with magnitude processing in non-motor tasks, such as length, size, or number comparison . The general relevance of magnitude information for action may in fact explain why magnitudes as varied as distance, size, or duration are integrated within a generalized magnitude system located in the parietal cortex . Making prospective judgments about an object-directed action and mentally simulating the action both require the computation of magnitude estimates, such as grip aperture or reaching distance, but existing studies have left out the possibility that the fronto-parietal areas activated during prospective action judgments and motor imagery might actually reflect magnitude processing. Finally, when considering specifically the primary somatosensory (S1) or motor (M1) cortices, an increase of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal has been occasionally reported during explicit simulation of an action but not during prospective action judgments . Hence, the fronto-parietal activations found during prospective action judgments might in fact reflect a direct comparison between object size/distance and grip/arm representation, rather than some form of motor simulation, as assumed in earlier definitions of this process . \n\nIn order to test whether or not prospective action judgments involve motor simulation, we exploited the respective advantages of fMRI, as a method to record and compare the whole-brain BOLD response, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), as a method to probe corticospinal excitability (CSE) modulation to hand muscles. In the first experiment, we used fMRI to map neural activity in the whole brain while participants were making judgments about their ability to grasp rectangles of various lengths between their index finger and thumb (i.e., graspability judgments) or while they were explicitly imagining themselves grasping various objects (i.e., motor imagery). In order to differentiate the brain areas involved in action processing from those involved in magnitude processing, a control task required participants to judge whether rectangles were larger than a perceptual reference (i.e., length judgments). Under the   motor simulation   hypothesis, graspability judgments and motor imagery should show overlapping activations within the fronto-parietal areas beyond the level of activation measured during length judgments. Under the   comparison-without-simulation   hypothesis, we expect the shared network to be equally activated during length judgments because its role would be to serve magnitude processing, irrespective of body capabilities. To gain further knowledge into the spatial distribution of activations within the areas shared by motor imagery, graspability and length judgments , we computed voxelwise correlations between the patterns of activations elicited by each task . In a second experiment, we directly measured motor excitability changes in a set of hand muscles by means of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by TMS during graspability and length judgments. A close look at the available data indicates that, compared to action execution, motor imagery only induces a 50\u201370% rise in BOLD signal in M1 . This might cause M1 activations to remain undetected in most studies, though laminar fMRI has recently proved efficient in detecting reliable activations in the superficial layer of M1 during motor imagery . An alternative is to investigate the instantaneous modulation of the CSE excitability of hand muscles, during motor imagery, through the recording of MEPs induced by single pulse TMS over M1 in the contralateral hand . MEPs provide a sensitive output measure of fronto-parietal activity during motor imagery, as CSE changes may be caused by M1 or any frontal or parietal area remotely connected to M1 . It is also possible to track the unfolding of the imagined movement by delivering TMS pulses at different times relative to the task onset . Finally, when TMS is used to excite pools of corticospinal cells projecting onto different muscles, CSE changes are specific to the muscles involved in the imagined movement . Under the   motor simulation   hypothesis, graspability judgments, but not length judgments, should be associated with an increase of MEPs in the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) and the abductor pollicis brevis (APB), which both contribute to adjust the precision grip, but not in the abductor digiti minimi (ADM), which is not relevant for thumb-index pinch movements. Moreover, TMS should elicit larger MEPs when it is delivered as the imagined grasp movement unfolds. Under the   comparison-without-simulation   hypothesis, no difference in MEP amplitude is expected during graspability and length judgments since the comparison of object size with grip aperture is analogue to the comparison of two lengths. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### fMRI experiment \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nThirty-two healthy volunteers (21 females, mean age and standard error (SE): 23\u2009\u00b1\u20090.41\u00a0years) participated in this fMRI experiment. They were all right-handed according to the Edinburgh inventory questionnaire , had no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and were unaware of the purpose of the study. They gave their written informed consent prior to the experiment. The study was non-invasive, performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the Biomedical Ethical Committee of the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain. The data of one participant were excluded because of drifts superior to 5\u00a0mm in translation in the functional images and those of another participant because unusually strong susceptibility artifacts were visible at the level of the frontal cortex. The analyses were conducted on the 30 remaining participants. \n\n\n#### Tasks and stimuli \n  \nThe fMRI experiment included a prospective graspability judgment, a motor imagery, and a perceptual length judgment task as well as their reference tasks (Fig.\u00a0 A). The graspability judgment (GJ) required participants to judge whether they would be able to grasp a rectangle lengthways between their index finger and thumb, without actually moving their fingers. To minimize head motion, participants had to respond \u201cyes\u201d aloud only when they judged the rectangle as graspable but stay silent when they judged it as ungraspable. The stimuli consisted of seven black rectangles with a height of 1\u00a0cm and a length equal to the maximum grip aperture (MGA) of the participant\u2009\u00b1\u20090, 1, 2, or 5\u00a0cm. The reference task was a detection task in which the participant was required to say \u201cyes\u201d aloud when each time a 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00a0cm rectangular shape appeared on the screen. The motor imagery task (MI) required participants to imagine themselves grasping an object displayed on the screen as if they were about to use it. The stimuli consisted of colored pictures of 40 everyday objects (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ). The reference task consisted of the display of the same pictures scrambled in such a way that objects could no longer be identified. The length judgment (LJ) required participants to judge whether a rectangle was larger or not than a standard shown just before the beginning of the acquisition run. Participants had to respond \u201cyes\u201d aloud when the bar was larger than the standard and stay silent when the response was \u201cno\u201d. The stimuli and the reference task were the same as those used for the graspability judgment, except that the stimulus length was computed from the MGA of another participant\u2009\u00b1\u20090, 1, 2, or 5\u00a0cm, so that the references used for length and graspability judgments were different for each participant but equal across participants (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE: 12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18\u00a0cm).   \nSchematic representation of the time course of the fMRI experiment. Part (  A  ) represent the experimental tasks and their reference with an example of stimuli used, and part (  B  ) an example of acquisition run structure. Each run consisted of 20-speriods of one of the experimental task or its reference alternating with 10\u00a0s-periods of fixation. \n  \n\n\n#### Procedure \n  \nTo optimize the signal-to-noise ratio while controlling for speech-related head motion artefacts , we used a block-design paradigm, with ten blocks lasting 20,000\u00a0ms each, alternating an experimental task and its reference interleaved with 10,000\u00a0ms fixation periods (Fig.\u00a0 B). Within each block and trial, each stimulus was projected on a screen, in the rear of the scanner, and viewed by the participant via a tilted mirror mounted on the head coil for 2000\u00a0ms, with a 500-ms inter-trial interval. For the graspability and length judgments, each block consisted of eight trials including three rectangles smaller than the participant's MGA/standard, three rectangles larger than their MGA/standard and two of the length of their MGA/standard, presented in a random order. For the reference (detection) task, each block consisted of 4 to 5 stimuli presented with a random inter-trial interval. For the motor imagery, each experimental block included eight objects and each reference\u00a0block eight scrambled objects. Each pair of experimental and reference tasks was used in two fMRI acquisition runs, resulting in six runs which order was pseudo-randomly counterbalanced across participants such that the graspability judgment was always performed before the motor imagery task in order to keep mental simulation implicit during the graspability judgment (i.e., LJ\u2013GJ\u2013MI, GJ\u2013LJ\u2013MI and GJ\u2013MI\u2013LJ). Verbal responses were conveyed by a plastic tube to a digital recorder placed in an anechoic box outside the scanner room . The responses were recorded and analyzed off-line to verify that participants made accurate judgments and observed the specific instructions given for each task (see Supplemental Material). \n\n\n#### Imaging data acquisition \n  \nFor each participant, a high-resolution anatomical image was first acquired with a 3.0\u00a0T magnetic resonance imager (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems) and an 32-channel phased array head coil using a T1-weighted 3D turbo fast field-echo sequence with an inversion recovery prepulse (time to echo [TE]\u2009=\u20094.6\u00a0ms, time for repetition [TR]\u2009=\u20099.1\u00a0ms, flip angle [FA]\u2009=\u20098\u00b0, field of view [FOV]\u2009=\u2009220\u2009\u00d7\u2009197 mm2, 150 contiguous axial slices of 1\u00a0mm, voxel size\u2009=\u20090.76\u2009\u00d7\u20090.76x1 mm3, SENSE factor\u2009=\u20091.4). Functional images were then acquired as series of blood-oxygen-sensitive T2*-weighted echo-planar volumes (GRE-EPI) with the following parameters: TE\u2009=\u200932\u00a0ms, TR\u2009=\u20092500\u00a0ms, FA\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, FOV\u2009=\u2009220\u2009\u00d7\u2009220 mm , 36 contiguous axial slices acquired in an ascending sequence, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093.5\u00a0mm with no interslice gap, voxel size\u2009=\u20091.96\u2009\u00d7\u20091.96\u2009\u00d7\u20093.5\u00a0mm , SENSE factor (parallel imaging)\u2009=\u20092.5. Each acquisition run comprised 124 volumes, resulting in 80 volumes per experimental/reference task. \n\n\n#### Data analysis \n  \n##### Whole-brain analysis \n  \nBrain imaging data were processed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12, Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London UK ). All functional volumes were (1) realigned to the first volume of the respective run (closest to the anatomical scan) to correct for within- and between-run motion, (2) coregistered with the anatomical image, (3) corrected for slice acquisition delays, (4) normalized to the standard MNI template using a Trilinear interpolation and a voxel size of 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092 mm , and (5) smoothed with an 5-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. During realignment, drifts in the translation or rotation (i.e., roll, pitch, yaw) were checked for each participant and run. All data showed drifts inferior to 5\u00a0mm in translation and to three degrees in rotation. Condition-related changes in brain activity were estimated for each participant by a whole-volume voxel-wise analysis using a general linear model on which the responses evoked by each condition of interest were modeled by a standard hemodynamic response function. The contrasts computed at the individual level corresponded to each task contrasted with its reference (GJ\u2013refGJ, MI\u2013refMI, and LJ\u2013refLJ). We then examined the critical contrasts at the group level In order to reveal the brain areas commonly activated in GJ and MI, the contrasts computed at the group level were entered in a conjunction analysis ([GJ\u2013refGJ] AND [MI\u2013refMI]). In order to identify brain areas of this common network that were specific to the context of action, the areas found in the contrast of the length judgment and its reference were removed from the conjunction using a mask ([GJ\u2013refGJ] AND [MI\u2013refMI] masked exclusively by [LJ\u2013refLJ]). We also sought for differences between the graspability and length judgment tasks by computing the following subtractions: [GJ\u2013refGJ]\u2013[LJ\u2013refLJ] and [LJ\u2013refLJ]\u2013[GJ\u2013refGJ]. We reported only activations surviving a statistical threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 corrected at the cluster level with   Random Field Theory   for   Family Wise Error   (FWE)  and extending to at least 10 contiguous voxels. \n\n\n##### Voxelwise correlations \n  \nIn order to test whether the overlapping activations found in the whole-brain analysis could result from intermingled but distinct neural networks, voxelwise correlations between task-related effects were computed at the best spatial resolution achievable with our data (i.e., 8 mm ). The rationale is the following: if tasks A and B involve a similar pattern of activation distribution within region X, the voxels of this region that are the most (or less) activated in response to tasks A and B should be\u00a0identical, leading to a positive correlation between the signal change in tasks A and B when computed across voxels of region X. Alternatively, a null or negative correlation would indicate that the voxels that are the most (or less) activated in response to task A are different than those that are the most (or less) activated in response to task B, suggesting separate but intermingled networks within region X for tasks A and B . The clusters revealed by the conjunction analysis of the three experimental tasks were intersected with a 5-mm-radius sphere centered on peak voxels of each of the clusters. The t-values were then extracted from the resulting regions for each contrast and each participant from a set of normalized but unsmoothed data. We then computed Pearson coefficients at the individual level for the following correlations: (1) between the t-values of the [GJ\u2212refGJ] contrast and the t-values of the [MI\u2212refMI] contrast, (2) between the t-values of the [GJ\u2212refGJ] contrast and the t-values of the [LJ\u2212refLJ] contrasts and (3) between the t-values of the [MI\u2212refMI] contrast and the t-values of the [LJ\u2212refLJ] contrasts. To estimate whether significant correlations reflect a high degree of similarity between tasks, we also computed voxelwise correlations on the contrasts between experimental and reference tasks using a split-half procedure. This allowed us to compare the between-task correlations to the within-task correlations. Finally, in order to rule out that these correlations could be driven by physiological or measurement-related artefacts or general processes such as attention, we computed a representational similarity matrix (RSM) from the betas values and compared the pattern of correlations among experimental tasks with the pattern of correlations among reference tasks. If the correlations were driven by basic confounds, the reference tasks should also correlate with each other. The mean coefficient of each correlation was tested against 0 using a one-sample t-test and coefficients were compared to each other when relevant by using paired-sample t-tests. T-tests were corrected for multiple comparison with Bonferroni correction. \n\n\n##### Lateralization \n  \nWe also investigated the lateralization of the activations during graspability judgments, length judgments and motor imagery by extracting the t-values from the left vs. right aIPS for each participant and each experimental task contrasted with its reference. These regions of interest (ROIs) were defined as 5-mm-radius-spheres, centered around the average x,\u00a0y,\u00a0z coordinates obtained from a meta-analysis of the regions constitutive of the grasping execution network , which were then transformed into the MNI space. The resulting MNI x, y, z coordinates were \u2212\u200939, \u2212\u200944, 44 for the left aIPS and 42, \u2212\u200943, 47. The definition of the ROIs and the extraction of the t-values were performed with the MarsBAR toolbox ( ). The t-values of the left and right aIPS were then compared, separately for each experimental task, using paired sample t-tests corrected for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction. \n\n\n\n\n### TMS-MEP experiment \n  \n#### Participants \n  \nNine healthy volunteers (7 females,   M  \u2009=\u200924\u2009\u00b1\u20090.94\u00a0years) participated in this experiment. They were right-handed according to the Edinburgh inventory questionnaire , had no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and had not participated in the fMRI experiment. All were screened for TMS contraindications, including recent use of alcohol, caffeine and drug . They gave their written informed consent prior to the experiment and were unaware of the purpose of the study. The study was non-invasive and\u00a0performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n#### Tasks and stimuli \n  \nParticipants were required to perform similar prospective graspability judgments and length judgments as in the fMRI experiment, with two main changes. First, in order to disentangle the veridical size of the graspable stimuli from their perceived size relative to the visual context, judgments were performed on a horizontal line ended by arrows pointing inwards or outwards. Typically, when the line is ended by inwards pointing arrows (>\u2009<), it appears to be longer, while it appears smaller\u00a0when it is ended by outwards pointing arrows (<\u2009>), corresponding to the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion configuration. We also used an additional figure with vertical lines (| |) displayed at each end of the horizontal line as a control, not inducing any illusion. Previous studies showed that the size distortion is striking in perceptual length judgments, but its effect on grip aperture during grasping movement towards the horizontal line is\u00a0significantly smaller, most probably because action is more object-centered and less influenced by the visual context than perception . Second, in order to get a finer behavioral measure, we added two intermediate lengths for the horizontal line resulting in \u2212\u20095, \u2212\u20093, \u2212\u20092, \u2212\u20091, 0,\u2009+\u20091,\u2009+\u20092,\u2009+\u20093,\u2009+\u20095\u00a0cm, with respect to the standard (length judgment) or maximum grip aperture (graspability judgment). Mean stimuli length was 11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.41\u00a0cm for both the graspability and length judgments. The analysis of behavioral performance showed that participants performed the two tasks correctly while relying on the veridical size of the stimuli to judge their graspability and on the perceived size to judge their length (see Supplemental Material). \n\n\n#### Experimental procedure \n  \nThe graspability and length judgments were performed on distinct sessions scheduled on two different days at a one-week interval. During each session, the participants sat at 60\u00a0cm of a computer screen with both hands resting on a table, palms down and arms semiflexed. Each trial started with the presentation of a fixation cross for 500\u00a0ms followed by a M\u00fcller-Lyer figure. The participants responded \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d aloud to indicate whether they judged the horizontal line as graspable or not (graspability judgment) or as larger than the standard or not (length judgment). The instructions emphasized the need to respond as quickly and accurately as possible, and responses were noted by the experimenter. After response, the figure disappeared and a blank screen was displayed for a time randomly set between 3000 and 5000\u00a0ms before a new trial started. For each judgment, all possible combinations of lengths (i.e., 9 values), illusions (i.e., 3 displays) and TMS timings (i.e., 3 delays, see below) were repeated three times, in random order, giving rise to 243 trials divided in two sub-blocks. \n\n\n#### TMS-MEP protocol \n  \nSingle-pulse TMS was applied with a 70\u00a0mm figure-of-eight coil connected to a Magstim 200 magnetic stimulator (Magstim, Whitland, Dyfed, UK). The coil was placed over the left M1, tangentially to the skull, with the handle pointing backward and laterally at a 45\u00b0 angle away from the sagittal axis, approximately perpendicular to the central sulcus . MEPs were recorded following each TMS pulse with surface electromyography (EMG) electrodes disposed on the FDI, APB and ADM muscles of the right hand. EMG data were collected for 1000\u00a0ms spanning the range of 500\u00a0ms before to 500\u00a0ms after the pulse. The EMG signals were amplified (\u00d7\u20091000), bandpass filtered online (10\u2013500\u00a0Hz; NeuroloLog; Digitimer), and digitalized at 2000\u00a0Hz for offline analysis. \n\nIn each participant, we first located the optimal spot for eliciting MEPs in the FDI muscle (  i.e.  , the \u201chotspot\u201d). This site was marked on a cap fitted on the participant's head to provide a reference point of M1 throughout the experimental session . The resting motor threshold (rMT) was defined as the lowest stimulation intensity allowing the generation of MEPs of at least 50\u00a0\u03bcV peak-to-peak on 5 out of 10 consecutive trials in the FDI muscle. Across participants, the rMT was 43% (\u00b1\u20097.4) of maximum stimulator output. The TMS intensity used during the experimental session was set at 115% of the rMT . At this intensity, a single TMS pulse delivered with a figure-of-eight coil, which stimulates a zone of about 10\u00a0mm of diameter, elicits MEPs simultaneously in adjacent hand muscles (  i.e.  , in the FDI, APB and ADM muscles) as corticospinal neurons projecting to different muscles of a given limb strongly overlap within M1 . To probe the putative changes in\u00a0CSE occurring during graspability and length judgments, we delivered a pulse at one out of three possible timings in the two tasks: (1) 150\u00a0ms or (2) 300\u00a0ms after stimulus onset, and (3) between 3000 and 5000\u00a0ms after response onset during the inter-trial interval (ITI). The timings of stimulation were defined after the observation of magnetoencephalography activity during the mental rotation of hand representation in the visual cortex from 150 to 180\u00a0ms after stimulus onset and in the parietal and premotor areas from 200 to 400\u00a0ms after stimulus onset . The pulses at 150 and 300\u00a0ms after stimulus onset thus provide a measure of corticospinal activity before and during the period the hand representation is expected to be transformed in motor areas under the assumption that graspability judgments involves motor simulation. A total of 81 MEPs was recorded at each timing in each task, with three MEPs for each possible combination of object size and illusion display. In addition, we recorded 20 MEPs, before each sub-block started, to obtain a baseline measure of MEP amplitude throughout the experiment. \n\n\n#### Data analysis \n  \nTrials with background electromyography (EMG) activity (root mean square computed from \u2212\u2009250 to \u2212\u200950\u00a0ms before the TMS pulse) exceeding 2.5 SD above the mean were discarded (2.22% removal). This was done to prevent contamination of the MEP measurements by significant fluctuations in background EMG . We then extracted the MEP peak-to-peak amplitude for each trial. MEP amplitudes were averaged separately for each TMS timing, each muscle, each task and each subject. MEPs with an amplitude exceeding 2.5 SD around the mean of the condition were discarded (73\u2009\u00b1\u20094 trials remaining per condition). A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was then used to model the MEP amplitude in each muscle, separately, with  (length vs. graspability),   (baseline  150\u00a0ms, 300\u00a0ms vs. ITI) and their interaction as fixed effects, and the differences between participants as random effects. Bonferroni correction was applied to post hoc comparisons where relevant. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### fMRI experiment \n  \n#### Whole-brain analysis \n  \n##### Graspability judgment \n  \nContrasting fMRI responses for the graspability judgment task with those for its reference task revealed brain activations bilaterally in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and along the anterior\u2013posterior axis of the IPS, including the aIPS (MNI coordinates x, y, z: 42, \u2212\u200949, 47 and \u2212\u200945, \u2212\u200937, 44). Parietal activations in the right hemisphere included the supramarginal and angular gyri, the superior parietal lobule (SPL) and extended to the precuneus. Frontal activations were almost restricted to the right hemisphere, including the right middle and anterior cingulate cortex and the superior and middle frontal gyri in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the SMA. Activations were also registered within the pars opercularis, orbitalis and triangularis of the right inferior frontal gyrus, which partly corresponded to the rostral part of PMv. In the occipital areas, clusters of activation were found around the right calcarine sulcus and in the left inferior occipital gyrus, corresponding to secondary (V2) visual areas. Other clusters of activations were found in the left posterior lobe of the cerebellum (VI and crus I and II of VII), and in the left and right insula (Table  a and Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nBrain regions showing significant activations for (a) graspability judgments, (b) motor imagery and (c) length judgments compared to their own reference task.\u00a0k = cluster size (number of voxels); x,y,z = peak coordinates (MNI); T = t-statistic. \n    \nRendering of the statistical maps showing the cortical areas activated in (  A  ) the graspability judgment task vs. its reference, (  B  ) the motor imagery task vs. its reference and (  C  ) the length judgment task vs. its reference, surviving at a statistical threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 corrected at the cluster level for multiple comparisons and extending to   k  \u2009=\u2009at least 10 contiguous voxels . \n  \n\n\n##### Motor imagery \n  \nContrasting the motor imagery task with its reference revealed a large left-lateralized fronto-parietal network. Parietal activations were found in the left IPL (including the supramarginal gyrus),\u00a0along the anterior\u2013posterior axis of the IPS (including aIPS; \u2212\u200945, \u2212\u200934, 41), extending to the SPL and the precuneus. Frontal activations were found in the SMA bilaterally, the left anterior cingulate cortex, precentral gyrus (in particular the PMd and caudal PMv) and middle frontal gyrus (DLPFC). Activations were also revealed in the pars triangularis and opercularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus, corresponding to rostral PMv. In the right hemisphere, frontal activations were restricted to the precentral gyrus, the superior frontal gyrus, and the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus. There were also activation foci in both the left and right associative visual cortex of the inferior occipital gyrus, the left middle occipital gyrus, fusiform area and the right inferior temporal gyrus. Finally, there were clusters of activation in the left and right posterior lobes of the cerebellum (VI and crus I of VII), the insula and the left putamen (Table  b and Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n##### Length judgment \n  \nContrasting the length judgment task with its reference revealed foci of activations bilaterally in the IPL and along the anterior\u2013posterior axis of the IPS (including aIPS; 39, \u2212\u200943, 44 and \u2212\u200945, 40, 44). Parietal activations in the right hemisphere included the angular and supramarginal gyri, the superior parietal lobule and the precuneus. Frontal activations were restricted to the right hemisphere and included the middle and anterior cingulate cortex, the superior and middle frontal gyri (DLPFC) and the pars opercularis, orbitalis and triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, which partly corresponded to the rostral part of PMv. In the occipital cortices, clusters of activations included both the right and left inferior occipital gyri and along the calcarine sulcus, and the right middle occipital gyrus, corresponding to V2 and the associative visual areas. Activations were also found in the right inferior temporal gyrus, bilaterally in the insula and the left posterior lobe of the cerebellum (VII, crus I and II; Table  c and Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n##### Graspability judgment and motor imagery \n  \nThe conjunction of graspability judgment and motor imagery, each contrasted to its own reference ([GJ\u2212refGJ] AND [MI\u2212refMI]), revealed the areas commonly involved in both tasks. They mainly corresponded to a fronto-parietal network including the left IPL, around the aIPS (\u2212\u200945, \u2212\u200937, 44), the left and right SMA and the right medial superior frontal gyrus. Additional activations were observed in the left and right insulas (Table   and Fig.\u00a0 ). In order to identify which of these brain areas were specific to the context of action, the same conjunction was masked exclusively by the contrast between the length judgment and its reference ([GJ\u2212refGJ] AND [MI\u2212refMI] masked exclusively by [LJ\u2212refLJ]). This did not reveal any significant cluster.   \nBrain regions showing activation in (a) the conjunction of the graspability judgment and motor imagery task, (b) the contrast between graspability judgments and motor imagery, (c) the contrast between motor imagery and graspability judgments and (d) the conjunction of the graspability and length judgments, each experimental task first being contrasted to its reference. k\u2009=\u2009cluster size (number of voxels); x,y,z\u2009=\u2009MNI coordinates of peak activation at the cluster level; T\u2009=\u2009t-statistic. \n    \nRendering of the cortical areas commonly activated in the graspability judgment and the motor imagery task, surviving a statistical threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 corrected at the cluster level for multiple comparisons and extending to k\u2009=\u2009at least 10 contiguous voxels . \n  \n\n\n##### Graspability and length judgments \n  \nThe picture emerging from the preceding task contrasts (see renders on Fig.\u00a0 ) suggests that graspability and length judgments involved the same right-lateralized fronto-parietal network. To investigate further this, we contrasted graspability judgment to length judgment ([GJ\u2212refGJ]\u2212[LJ\u2212refLJ]), and conversely ([LJ\u2212refLJ]\u2212[GJ\u2212refGJ]). The contrasts did not reveal any difference between the brain activations elicited by the two tasks. \n\n\n\n#### Voxelwise correlations \n  \nThe conjunction analysis performed on the three tasks (  i.e  ., [GJ\u2212refGJ] AND [MI\u2212refMI] AND [LJ\u2212refSJ]) revealed the same 5 clusters of activation as\u00a0the conjunction between graspability judgment and motor imagery (  i.e  ., [GJ\u2212refGJ] AND [MI\u2212refMI]): SMA, left aIPS, left IPL, left insula and right insula; Table  ; Fig.\u00a0 ). The voxelwise correlations on the contrast between each experimental task and its reference in each of the five regions identified by the conjunction analysis revealed positive and significant correlations in all ROIs between all pairs of tasks (all   r   ranging between 0.24 and 0.55; all   p  \u2009<\u20090.003). The Pearson coefficients for the correlation between the t-values of [GJ\u2212refGJ] and [MI\u2212refMI], [GJ\u2212refGJ] and [LJ\u2212refLJ] and between [MI\u2212refMI] and [LJ\u2212refLJ] are reported in Table  .   \nMean Pearson coefficients (\u00b1\u2009S.E.) of the correlations between the patterns of activation induced by the graspability judgment, length judgment and motor imagery tasks taken in pairs within the five regions revealed by the conjunction analysis of the three experimental tasks;  * p  -value\u2009<\u2009.05; **   p  -value\u2009<\u2009.01. \n  \n\nWe then compared the size of between-task correlations with the size of within-task correlations after splitting the data from each experimental task in two functional runs. This analysis showed that, in all ROIs, correlations between two runs of the same task were positively correlated (  r   between 0.21 and 0.67, all   p  -values\u2009<\u20090.001) and correlations between graspability and length judgments (  r   between 0.21 and 0.57, all   p  -values\u2009<\u20090.01) were as large as these within-task correlations. Paired sample t-tests showed that, for these two judgments, between-task correlations were not significantly different from within-task correlations (all   p  -values\u2009>\u20090.05). These results suggest that the functional overlap between the circuits involved in graspability and perceptual length judgments is similar to what could be expected based on the reproducible pattern of activations within each type of judgment. Because the motor imagery task used real object pictures (vs. rectangles) and required explicit motor imagery (vs. size comparison), we expected a difference in the size of between-task correlations and within-task correlations involving motor imagery. Indeed, correlations between GJ and MI (  r   between 0.19 and 0.38, all   p  -values\u2009<\u20090.01, except in the left insula where   r   between 0.06 and 0.22 were mostly   ns  ) and between LJ and MI (  r   between 0.17 and 0.33, all   p  -values\u2009<\u20090.05) were smaller than within-task correlations between two runs of MI (  r   between 0.36 and 0.67, all   p  -values\u2009<\u20090.001). \n\nFinally, to exclude that these correlations were due to physiological or measurement-related artefacts, we extracted the beta values and computed voxelwise correlations among the experimental tasks and among the reference tasks. In all ROIs, we found positive and significant correlations between the experimental tasks (all   r   ranging between 0.24 and 0.69, all   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), but close to zero and non-significant correlations between different reference tasks (all   r   ranging between \u2212\u20090.05 and 0.06, all   p  \u2009>\u20090.388). Note that the same detection task was used as a reference for graspability and length judgments explaining their positive correlation across ROIs (all   r   ranging between 0.21 and 0.42, all   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nRepresentational similarity matrices (RSM) representing the pairwise correlations between the beta values of all experimental and reference tasks in each of the five regions commonly activated by the graspability judgment, length judgment and motor imagery tasks. \n  \n\n\n#### Lateralization analysis \n  \nThe comparison of the t-values extracted from the left and right aIPS indicated significantly more activation in the left compared to the right aIPS for the [MI\u2212refMI] contrast (mean \u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\u2009=\u20091.48,   t  (29)\u2009=\u20098.83,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). On the contrary, there was significantly less activation in the left compared to the right aIPS for the [GJ\u2212refGJ] contrast (mean \u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\u2009=\u2009\u2009\u2212\u20090.47,   t  (29)\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20093.36,   p  \u2009=\u20090.002) and the [LJ\u2212refLJ] contrast (mean \u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.88,   t  (29)\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20095.68,   p  \u2009<\u20090.0\u200901). \n\n\n\n### TMS-MEP experiment \n  \n#### FDI \n  \nThe GLMM analysis on the amplitude of the MEPs recorded from the FDI showed a main effect of judgment,   F  (1,4979)\u2009=\u2009447.69,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, a main effect of timing,   F  (3, 4979)\u2009=\u20094.76,   p  \u2009=\u20090.003, and a significant interaction between the two factors,   F  (3, 4979)\u2009=\u20092.97,   p  \u2009=\u20090.031. For the graspability judgment, post-hoc pairwise contrasts indicated that, compared to the baseline (0.91\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15\u00a0mV), the MEPs were significantly larger during the ITI (1.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16\u00a0mV),   t  (4979)\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20093.72,   p  \u2009=\u20090.001. For the length judgment, post-hoc pairwise contrasts did not show any significant difference between TMS conditions (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nMean MEP amplitude (mV) recorded from the right FDI, APB and ADM following TMS over left M1. MEPs are shown for the baseline out, 150\u00a0ms, 300\u00a0ms and ITI in both the graspability (left side) and length (right side) judgment. Error bar represent standard errors;  * p  -value\u2009<\u2009.05; **   p  -value\u2009<\u2009.01. \n  \n\n\n#### APB \n  \nThe GLMM analysis on the amplitude of the MEPs recorded from the APB showed a significant effect of judgment,   F  (1,5076)\u2009=\u2009565.15,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, of timing,   F  (3, 5076)\u2009=\u200919.29,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, and a significant interaction between the two factors,   F  (3, 5076)\u2009=\u20094.16,   p  \u2009=\u20090.006. For the graspability judgment, post-hoc pairwise contrasts indicated that, compared to the baseline (0.47\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10\u00a0mV), the MEPs were significantly larger at 150\u00a0ms (0.56\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12\u00a0mV),   t  (5076)\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20093.33,   p  \u2009=\u20090.004, 300\u00a0ms (0.51\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\u00a0mV),   t  (5076)\u2009=\u2009 \u2212\u20091.97,   p  \u2009=\u20090.049, and during ITI (0.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14\u00a0mV),   t  (5076)\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20093.92,   p  \u2009=\u20090.001. For the length judgment, post-hoc pairwise contrasts did not show any significant difference between the timings (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n#### ADM \n  \nThe GLMM analysis on the amplitude of the MEPs recorded from the ADM showed a significant effect of judgment,   F  (1,4784)\u2009=\u2009239.11,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001, indicating that MEPs were larger during the graspability judgment (0.39\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u00a0mV) than during the length judgment (0.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\u00a0mV). There was a main effect of timing, suggesting an increase of MEP amplitude at 300\u00a0ms and during ITI, but pairwise contrasts with the baseline showed no significant differences (  p  -values\u2009>\u20090.1). There was no significant judgment x timing interaction,   F  (3, 4784)\u2009=\u20091.07,   p  \u2009=\u20090.362 (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nPrevious studies suggest that predicting the outcome of an action implies the mental simulation of this action. The brain circuits supporting such prospective action judgments and motor imagery are thus expected to overlap in the parietal and frontal cortices. However, the existence and precise nature of this neural overlap has never been addressed directly by comparing the brain activations elicited by the two tasks. Moreover, part of the neural network involved in prospective action judgments is also involved in spatial cognition tasks not related to action, such as comparing two lengths . The fronto-parietal activations observed during graspability judgments might thus indicate that they are achieved through the direct comparison of magnitude estimates, computed from grip aperture and object size, without implying any form of motor simulation as assumed earlier . To disentangle these accounts, an fMRI experiment assessed the possible neural overlap of prospective judgments and explicit imagery of grasping, and tested its specificity relative to the neural correlates of perceptual length judgments. The results showed that graspability judgment and motor imagery show overlapping activations within fronto-parietal areas, but that this shared network is also common to length judgment. In all the identified fronto-parietal areas, the pattern of activation selective to each experimental task correlated positively across voxels, indicating a similar spatial distribution of activations among the three tasks. When looking more closely at the left and right aIPS, a ROI analysis revealed hemispheric specialization, with the left aIPS contributing significantly more to motor imagery than to graspability/length judgments and the right aIPS contributing significantly more to graspability/length judgments than to motor imagery. Finally, an independent TMS-MEP experiment investigated motor excitability changes at the muscle level during graspability and length judgments. The results showed that graspability judgments caused a steady increase of the CSE, in-between trials, in the hand muscles specific to the precision grip. \n\nTo sum up, the conjunction of the activations registered during graspability judgment and motor imagery revealed a fronto-parietal network including the left IPL, aIPS, and the SMA bilaterally, with additional bilateral activations within the insula. However, all these areas were also involved in perceptual length judgments devoid of any motor content. The voxelwise correlation analysis indicates, at the best spatial resolution achievable in the present study, that overlapping activations do not result from separate intermingled networks since the distribution of the activations elicited by each task was similar across voxels. Further analyses allowed us to exclude that these correlations were driven by physiological artefacts, low-level perceptual or response preparation processes. We also showed\u00a0that the correlations between graspability and length judgments did not differ in size from the within-task correlations estimated from separate runs of the same task, suggesting the pattern of activation was highly similar between these two judgments. Together, these results show that the fronto-parietal network shared by the graspability judgment and motor imagery\u00a0task does not dissociate from the network involved in a perceptual length judgment with no motor component, and thus\u00a0cannot be interpreted as reflecting motor simulation. Instead, this network might reflect the processing of magnitude, which was a common principle of the three tasks that all required the computation of object size and/or grip aperture estimates. Previous studies have shown that areas around the IPS, in particular, are activated whenever two magnitudes presented visually (  e.g.,   sizes, lengths or orientations) have to be compared . This recurrent finding has been taken as evidence for the existence of a generalized magnitude system housed in the horizontal part of the IPS and involved in the sensorimotor transformations achieved by the parietal cortex, such as matching grip aperture with object size . This close connection between magnitude and action processing might also explain the involvement of some frontal areas contributing to graspability and length judgments. Previous studies indicated that the premotor cortex, including PMv and PMd, is activated whenever spatial distances are compared  or held in short-term memory . We propose that overlapping activations within the fronto-parietal cortex underlie the computation of object size estimates and the comparison to a reference maintained in short-term memory. Current models do not allow us to make precise predictions about which processes and/or representations are behind the comparison of object size and grasping capability . For instance, it is not clear whether magnitude processing or stimulus size representation is behind the involvement of the parietal cortex. A former parametric study of perceptual judgments has shown that the modulatory effect of size illusions on right parietal activity depends on whether the task explicitly requires object size comparison, suggesting that active magnitude processing rather than stimulus representation might cause parietal activation . These questions require further theoretical elaboration and experimental investigation using more sophisticated approaches such as representational similarity analyses or classification methods taking into account the variations in object size and the motor content of the judgments . The critical finding of the present experiment is that fronto-parietal regions contribute to magnitude processing irrespective of body capabilities, favoring the   comparison-without-simulation   hypothesis over the   motor simulation   hypothesis. \n\nWhile the results of the fMRI experiment could not dissociate the network involved in the graspability judgment from the network involved in the perceptual length judgment, the results of the TMS-MEP study revealed an increase in hand motor excitability during graspability judgment only. More particularly, graspability judgment induced a selective increase of MEP amplitude in the FDI and APB\u2014but not ADM\u2014muscles of the right hand. Such modulation of MEP amplitude was not observed in perceptual length judgment, which was fully matched with graspability judgment, except for the fact that it did not require activating grip representation. Thus, this increase can be viewed as the signature of the sensorimotor representation of the precision grip, which is involved in graspability, but not length judgments, and requires FDI and APB\u2014but not the ADM muscle. However, the activation of this sensorimotor representation was not limited to the time where the judgment took place. The timing of CSE changes in FDI and APB was not locked to the resolution of the graspability judgment. Compared to baseline, the MEP amplitude increased not only during the trials,   i.e.   150 and 300\u00a0ms after stimulus onset, but also in-between trials,   i.e.   more than 3000\u00a0ms after response onset, and this increase was actually larger in the latter condition. This pattern of results deviates from what has been previously observed in motor imagery tasks, where CSE changes are strictly bound to the progression of the imagined movement . In accordance with the fMRI results, the MEP results do not provide evidence for graspability judgments to involve the simulation of any reach and grasp movement. The particular enhancement of motor excitability in-between trials rather suggests that participants covertly activated the motor representation of their precision grip in preparation for the upcoming trial, or in reminiscence of the previous one, as if they were refreshing their memory of the maximal achievable grip aperture to facilitate the next judgment or verify the previous judgment. While it is noteworthy that this motor representation was maintained active during the judgment, as evidenced by the lower but significant enhancement of motor excitability during each trial, the results clearly emphasize the off-line involvement of the hand motor representation whose supportive role becomes manifest in-between trials. \n\nThese findings highlight the advantage of using TMS to probe the state of the motor system in the covert stages of action. In motor imagery tasks, the BOLD signal reflecting M1 activity is indeed cut down by 30\u201350%, which makes it difficult to detect , although emerging techniques such as laminar fMRI might definitely overcome this difficulty in the near future . The TMS-MEP study allowed probing the motor system differently, offering a temporal resolution near 100\u00a0ms, a greater sensitivity through the direct stimulation of hand muscles, and specificity through a distinction between agonist and non-agonist muscles of the imagined movement. \n\nThe brain imaging results further showed that the fronto-parietal activations were mainly left-lateralized during motor imagery and right lateralized during graspability and length judgments. More particularly, the motor imagery task engaged the left IPL, aIPS, and SPL, the left PMv and PMd, as well as the left M1 and S1, in line with previous studies . In the right hemisphere, the IPL, the rostral PMv and the SMA were also involved, though to a lesser extent. On the contrary, the graspability and length judgments showed large clusters of activations in the right hemisphere, namely the right precuneus, IPL, aIPS and SPL, as well as the SMA, right PMv and DLPFC, while activation in the left hemisphere were restricted to the IPL and aIPS. This hemipsheric lateralization was corroborated by the ROI analysis of the grasping network, with the left aIPS contributing exclusively to motor imagery and the right aIPS contributing to graspability/length judgments. The larger involvement of the left hemisphere during motor imagery is consistent with the dominant role of this hemisphere in motor functions . The larger involvement of the right hemisphere during graspability and length judgment is consistent with the role of this hemisphere in spatial cognition and in non-symbolic magnitude comparison . \n\nIt might be argued that the absence of difference between the networks involved in graspability and length judgments results from participants confounding perceptual and motor strategies. However, the instructions for the graspability and length judgments were formulated differently in order to prevent participants from adopting a similar strategy in both tasks: while participants had to judge whether a rectangle was small enough to be grasped between finger and thumb in the graspability judgment, they had to decide whether a rectangle was larger than a memorized reference in the length judgment. Hence, graspability judgments required a \u201cyes\u201d response to small rectangles whereas length judgments required a \u201cno\u201d response to small rectangles. Moreover, the perceptual reference used in the length judgment was of a\u00a0different length than the MGA in each participant. Behavioral data (procedure and results reported in the Supplement Material available online) of both experiments indicated that the regression of participants\u2019 responses on stimulus length had a negative slope in graspability judgments and a positive slope in length judgments, confirming that they\u00a0answered each task differently. Furthermore, in the TMS-MEP experiment, the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion was introduced as an additional means to differentiate the processing of relative and veridical object size estimates in length and graspability judgments. We observed that graspability judgments were less affected by the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion than perceptual judgments, in line with the idea that object-directed actions rely on a different spatial reference frame that insulates the object from the visual context. Both judgments thus integrated information relative to the visual context but the reduced effect of M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion in graspability judgments suggests the involvement of concurrent mechanisms that refined object size estimates for action calibration. This observation goes against a strict independence of the processes underlying visual perception and object-driven action, but fits with the idea that the visual context matters less when object size is matched with grip aperture rather than with a perceptual template . \n\nTo conclude, our results indicate that the fronto-parietal regions involved in graspability judgments do not dissociate from those involved in length judgments devoid of any motor content, favoring the idea that size comparison\u2014rather than motor imagery\u2014determines their involvement. The right hemisphere contribution to graspability and length judgments contrasts with the left hemisphere contribution to explicit motor imagery and further challenges the idea that prospective action judgments involve the mental simulation of the judged action. Our brain imaging and electrophysiological data actually rather converge to suggest that the motor system is activated covertly, at a subthreshold level, to refresh the short-term memory of one\u2019s maximal grip aperture and facilitate its comparison with object size in subsequent judgments or verify the correctness of previous judgments. Overall, the study demonstrates how neurophysiological measurements obtained with non-invasive brain stimulation may bridge the gap between cognitive and brain imaging research and thereby renew functional hypotheses about action prediction. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tAnatomical regions\tk\tx\ty\tz\tT\na\t[GJ\u2212refGJ]\t[GJ\u2212refGJ]\t[GJ\u2212refGJ]\t[GJ\u2212refGJ]\t[GJ\u2212refGJ]\t[GJ\u2212refGJ]\n\tRight calcarine sulcus\t340\t18\t\u2212\u200990\t\u2212\u20092\t11.31\n\tRight middle cingulate gyrus, medial superior frontal gyrus\t387\t6\t26\t38\t10.57\n\tLeft inferior occipital gyrus\t232\t\u2212\u200924\t\u2212\u200994\t\u2212\u200910\t10.29\n\tRight insula\t365\t36\t20\t2\t10.13\n\tRight inferior parietal lobule, intraparietal sulcus, superior parietal lobule\t811\t38\t\u2212\u200956\t48\t9.29\n\tRight middle frontal gyrus\t139\t42\t50\t12\t8.71\n\tRight precuneus\t71\t8\t\u2212\u200970\t52\t8.45\n\tRight middle frontal gyrus and triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus\t152\t46\t32\t28\t8.33\n\tLeft inferior parietal lobule, intraparietal sulcus\t49\t\u2212\u200946\t\u2212\u200938\t44\t8.00\n\tLeft cerebellar lobule VI and VII (Crus I)\t80\t\u2212\u200932\t\u2212\u200966\t\u2212\u200930\t7.76\n\tLeft cerebellar lobule VII (Crus II)\t24\t\u2212\u20096\t\u2212\u200978\t\u2212\u200926\t7.46\n\tLeft insula\t89\t\u2212\u200934\t18\t\u2212\u20092\t7.44\n\tRight superior frontal gyrus, bilateral supplementary motor area\t18\t14\t20\t64\t7.40\n\tRight orbital part of the right inferior frontal gyrus\t25\t44\t46\t\u2212\u20094\t7.06\n\tLeft inferior parietal lobule\t31\t\u2212\u200938\t\u2212\u200950\t50\t6.88\n\tRight supramarginal gyrus\t10\t52\t\u2212\u200932\t48\t6.72\n\tRight anterior cingulate gyrus\t10\t8\t36\t22\t6.69\n\tRight precentral, opercular part of the frontal inferior gyrus\t20\t44\t4\t26\t6.50\nb\t[MI\u2212refMI]\t[MI\u2212refMI]\t[MI\u2212refMI]\t[MI\u2212refMI]\t[MI\u2212refMI]\t[MI\u2212refMI]\n\tRight cerebellar lobule VI and VII (Crus I), inferior occipital gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus\t1370\t34\t\u2212\u200952\t\u2212\u200928\t16.34\n\tLeft inferior occipital gyrus, cerebellar lobule VI and VII (crus I), fusiform gyrus\t2425\t\u2212\u200944\t\u2212\u200974\t\u2212\u20098\t16.05\n\tLeft inferior parietal lobule, intraparietal sulcus, superior parietal lobule, precuneus, middle occipital gyrus\t3474\t\u2212\u200950\t\u2212\u200928\t42\t14.69\n\tLeft precentral gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral supplementary motor area, left middle frontal gyrus\t2111\t\u2212\u200926\t\u2212\u200912\t56\t14.55\n\tLeft precentral gyrus, opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, insula\t1176\t\u2212\u200952\t8\t26\t12.73\n\tLeft middle frontal gyrus, triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus\t243\t\u2212\u200944\t38\t12\t8.94\n\tRight precentral, superior frontal gyrus\t102\t26\t\u2212\u200910\t56\t7.81\n\tRight insula, opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus\t40\t36\t20\t4\t7.27\n\tLeft insula\t18\t\u2212\u200940\t0\t2\t6.81\n\tLeft putamen\t22\t\u2212\u200920\t2\t6\t5.96\nc\t[ LJ\u2212refLJ]\t[ LJ\u2212refLJ]\t[ LJ\u2212refLJ]\t[ LJ\u2212refLJ]\t[ LJ\u2212refLJ]\t[ LJ\u2212refLJ]\n\tRight inferior parietal lobule, including the angular and supramarginal gyri, intraparietal sulcus, superior parietal lobule, precuneus, middle occipital gyrus\t2616\t40\t\u2212\u200942\t44\t12.66\n\tRight insula, triangular, orbital and opercular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus\t2242\t48\t30\t28\t11.87\n\tRight middle and anterior cingulate gyrus, medial superior frontal gyrus\t867\t6\t26\t38\t11.85\n\tLeft cerebellar lobule VII (Crus I)\t423\t\u2212\u200932\t\u2212\u200966\t\u2212\u200930\t11.42\n\tRight calcarine sulcus, inferior and middle occipital gyri\t490\t18\t\u2212\u200992\t\u2212\u20092\t11.26\n\tLeft cerebellar lobule VII (Crus II)\t189\t\u2212\u20096\t\u2212\u200978\t\u2212\u200928\t10.38\n\tLeft inferior occipital gyrus, calcarine fissure, fusiform gyrus\t348\t\u2212\u200924\t\u2212\u200994\t\u2212\u200910\t10.30\n\tLeft insula\t290\t\u2212\u200934\t18\t0\t9.66\n\tRight middle and superior frontal gyrus\t448\t30\t2\t52\t9.53\n\tLeft intraparietal sulcus\t83\t\u2212\u200946\t\u2212\u200938\t44\t8.85\n\tLeft inferior parietal lobule\t148\t\u2212\u200934\t\u2212\u200952\t46\t8.41\n\tLeft middle occipital gyrus\t37\t\u2212\u200926\t\u2212\u200974\t28\t7.95\n\tRight inferior temporal gyrus\t54\t54\t\u2212\u200950\t\u2212\u200910\t7.60\n\tLeft inferior parietal lobule, middle occipital gyrus\t10\t\u2212\u200926\t\u2212\u200960\t40\t6.35\n### Caption\nBrain regions showing significant activations for (a) graspability judgments, (b) motor imagery and (c) length judgments compared to their own reference task.\u00a0k = cluster size (number of voxels);

Given that the hippocampus contains a high density of cannabinoid receptors, hippocampal-mediated cognitive functions, including visuospatial memory, may have increased vulnerability to chronic marijuana use. Thus, the current study examined brain activation during the performance of a virtual analogue of the classic Morris water maze task in 10 chronic marijuana (MJ) users compared to 18 nonusing (NU) comparison subjects. Imaging data were acquired using blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI at 3.0\u2009Tesla during retrieval (hidden platform) and motor control (visible platform) conditions. While task performance on learning trials was similar between groups, MJ users demonstrated a deficit in memory retrieval. For BOLD fMRI data, NU subjects exhibited greater activation in the right parahippocampal gyrus and cingulate gyrus compared to the MJ group for the Retrieval-Motor Control contrast (NU > MJ). These findings suggest that hypoactivation in MJ users may be due to differences in the efficient utilization of neuronal resources during the retrieval of memory. Given the paucity of data on visuospatial memory function in MJ users, these findings may help elucidate the neurobiological effects of marijuana on brain activation during memory retrieval. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nResearch on marijuana (MJ) use continues to be a major area of investigation, since MJ remains the most widely used illicit drug in several countries, including the United States [ ]. Daily, long-term, and frequent MJ use can have serious adverse effects on mental and physical health and can affect work performance, family, and school functioning [ ]. In 2009, epidemiological data (Treatment Episode Data Set) indicated that MJ was associated with 740,800 substance abuse treatment admissions, with daily use being reported in 23% of treatment entries [ ]. Nearly half (46.3%) of daily MJ admissions occurred in individuals between ages 26 and 40 years old and 34.2% between ages 18 and 25 years old [ ]. In addition, there has been a rise in the prevalence of MJ use among youth, with 36.4% and 22.6% of high school seniors reporting past year and past 30 days use, respectively. Given that rapid brain maturation occurs from adolescence into the early twenties [ ,  ], a time when MJ use is often initiated and tends to increase, identifying neurobiological vulnerabilities associated with MJ use is critical. \n\nShort-term effects of MJ have been reported across a number cognitive domains (for review [ ,  ]), including deficits in memory [ ], attention and mental flexibility [ ], response inhibition [ ], decision making [ ,  ], emotional processing [ ], and impulsivity [ ]. However, to date there have been limited studies examining the effects of MJ on spatial memory processing. While chronic MJ users have been shown to exhibit deficits on tests of visual recognition, delayed visual recall, and prospective memory [ ], a meta-analytic study failed to find substantial long-term neurocognitive deficits, except in the domains of learning and forgetting [ ]. To this end, significant structural and functional changes have been reported in young MJ users in brain regions implicated in learning and memory [ \u2013 ]. \n\nThe hippocampus may be notably vulnerable to the effects of MJ, given the high density of cannabinoid receptors in this area [ ]. Findings from animal studies have provided evidence supporting cannabinoid-induced impairments on hippocampal-mediated memory tasks [ \u2013 ]. For instance, activation of cannaninoid-1 (CB ) receptors in mice in the hippocampal region inhibited long-term potentiation (LTP), which is a neurobiological model for learning and memory [ ]. Administration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u0394 -THC) impaired spatial memory in mice tested on the Morris water maze task (WMT), while the CB  receptor antagonist SR141716A reversed the impairment [ ]. Similar Morris water maze impairments were reported in mice after injection of \u0394 -THC or inhalation of marijuana smoke [ ]. These findings provide evidence of cannabinoid-induced impairments on hippocampus-dependent spatial learning tasks, likely due to interference in learning acquisition and retrieval processing. \n\nThe hippocampus is necessary for processing spatial layout and configural representation of an environment [ \u2013 ], as rodents with hippocampal lesions demonstrate spatial memory deficits, evidenced as an inability to find a hidden platform in the Morris WMT [ ,  ,  ]. In addition to compelling animal literature indicating that MJ exposure impacts hippocampal function [ ,  ,  ], humans with medial temporal lobe damage, including the hippocampus and associated areas, exhibit impaired declarative memory, such that patients have an inability to describe time, place, and meaning of events [ ]. Patients with unilateral hippocampal resections demonstrate impaired spatial navigation during performance of a virtual Morris WMT [ ]. Studies employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques provide evidence for altered brain activation patterns in memory-related processing regions associated with heavy MJ use. Long-term, heavy MJ users exhibit greater widespread blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation compared to NU during a spatial working memory task after short-term drug withdrawal [ ]. In a study using a visuospatial 2-back working memory fMRI task, MJ users and NU exhibited similar task performance; however, MJ users demonstrated greater activation in the inferior and middle frontal gyri, areas associated with visuospatial working memory, and increased activation in the right superior temporal gyrus, an area not typically recruited for visuospatial working memory [ ]. The parahippocampal area also plays an important role in spatial memory, namely, allocentric memory processing, especially during viewing of complex scenes with objects and landmarks (e.g., [ \u2013 ]). An increased response in the parahippocampal gyrus has been reported for objects at relevant locations (i.e., at decision making points) during an object-location memory task [ ], suggesting that neural activation in the parahippocampus is associated with the navigational relevance of an object's location. \n\nThe frontal cortex, specifically, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, has been implicated in spatial working memory tasks [ ,  ]. While MJ effects on spatial working memory have been the subject of several investigations, the objective of the present study was to investigate MJ-related effects on spatial memory (learning and retrieval) to examine differences in neural activation during the performance of a virtual analogue of the Morris water maze task. Based on the work by Jager and colleagues [ ], it was hypothesized that MJ users would demonstrate hypoactivity in the hippocampal/parahippocampal region relative to NU participants. Further, exploratory analysis of the cingulate gyrus was performed, given that this region is activated during WMT performance [ ], but also frontal-related alterations associated with MJ use have been previously reported [ ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nThe study sample consisted of ten chronic marijuana (MJ) users (8 males) and eighteen nonusing (NU) comparison subjects (11 males). Participants were recruited through local advertisement and screened by telephone interview to ensure they met criteria for inclusion in the study. All aspects of the clinical research protocol were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of McLean Hospital (Belmont, MA, USA). After a complete description of the study, participants provided written informed consent. All participants received monetary compensation ($100) for study completion. Participant demographics are presented in  . \n\nTo qualify for study entry, MJ smokers had to have smoked MJ a minimum of 2500 times, used MJ at least five of the last seven days prior to the study visit, test positive for urinary cannabinoids, and meet DSM-IV criteria for MJ abuse on the day of scanning. MJ users were asked to refrain from smoking for 12 hours immediately preceding the study visit and were told a urine sample would be collected at the initiation of the study visit, in order to improve compliance. The NU participants reported fewer than 5 lifetime episodes of MJ use and did not use any other illicit substances. Exclusion criteria for all subjects included history of head injury, loss of consciousness, history of organic mental disorder, seizure disorder or central nervous system disease, and contraindications to MR scanning (e.g., pacemaker, aneurysm clips, metallic implants, pregnancy, or claustrophobia). MJ users reported consuming 4.4 \u00b1 4.3 alcoholic beverages per week, while NU participants reported consuming 1.8 \u00b1 2.5 alcoholic beverages per week (  F  (1,26) = 4.2,   P   = .05). Four MJ users reported recent nicotine use (ranging from 1 pack per day; 1 pack every 2 weeks; 1 pack per month; occasional/social use). NU adults did not report any use of nicotine. \n\nThe Barratt Simplified Measure of Social Status (BSMSS) was used to measure socioeconomic status (SES) [ ]. Clinical interviews were conducted using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID; [ ]). All participants were free of Axis I diagnosis, except the MJ group, who were required to meet criteria for MJ abuse. Participants completed the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS; [ ]), a 20-item scale measuring positive and negative affects, and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A; [ ]), a 14-item scale measuring anxiety level. The Addiction Severity Index (ASI) was used to evaluate substance abuse using a 5-point scale (0 = not at all; 4 = extremely) for questions regarding seven areas in their life that include medical condition, employment, drug use, alcohol use, illegal activity, family/social relations, and psychiatric function [ ]. The Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist (MWC), a 12-item scale, was used to assess withdrawal symptom during the early stages of abstinence is a 12-item scale used [ ]. Clinical data are presented in  . \n\nAll participants provided a urine sample to be tested for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (Triage Drugs of Abuse Panel: Immediate Response Diagnostics, Biosite, San Diego, CA, USA). A positive result for THC confirmed recent MJ use in the MJ group, while a negative result was required for the NU group. Standard laboratory urinalysis assessed an aliquot of the urine sample, which included gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy in order to quantify the level of 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) and creatinine (Quest Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA, USA). To allow for differences in urinary concentration among the participants, levels of THC-COOH were normalized to urinary creatinine levels. \n\nA measure of general intellectual ability (IQ) was derived using two of the four subtests (vocabulary and matrix reasoning) from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI, [ ]). Visuospatial ability and spatial perception were assessed using the Mental Rotation Task [ ] and the Santa Barbara Sense-of-Direction Scale (SBSOD) [ ]. The Mental Rotation Task is a four-minute paper-pencil test in which participants match a target item to two of four rotated versions. One point is given for a correct response, with a maximum score of 24. The SBSOD is a 15-item self-report measure of environmental spatial ability. The questionnaire consists of several statements about spatial and navigational abilities, preferences, and experiences. Subjects circle a number to indicate their level of agreement with each statement using a seven-point scale ranging from \u201c1: strongly agree\u201d to \u201c7: strongly disagree\u201d. \n\nA PC-compatible laptop was used for testing and operating the virtual water maze program (NeuroInvestigations, Inc., Lethbridge, Canada). The virtual environment was comprised of a circular pool located in the center of a square room, with four large abstract pictures positioned on the walls, which served as landmarks ( ). Subjects viewed the virtual environment from a first-person perspective and navigated through the environment using an MR-compatible joystick that allowed right, left, and forward, but not backward, movements. Participants began each trial facing the wall of the pool, from each of four starting positions: north, south, east, and west. The platform was always located in the northeast (NE) quadrant for all trials for all participants. \n\nPrior to the start of the experiment (nonscanning and scanning conditions), participants completed a training phase outside of the MR suite, which consisted of two trials with the platform visible in the NE quadrant, in order to familiarize them with the task and the use of the joystick. The virtual environment used for training had landmarks that were unique from those in the virtual environment presented during nonscanning and during fMRI. The experimental phase consisted of three conditions: Learning (Hidden Trials\u2014conducted outside the magnet/nonscanning); Retrieval (Hidden Trials\u2014conducted in the magnet); Motor Control (Visible Trials\u2014conducted in the magnet). During the Learning condition, each participant completed 4 blocks of hidden platform trials (4 trials per block, each trial beginning from a different location), in which the platform was hidden under the surface of the water and the participants were instructed to navigate to the platform as quickly as possible. The platform was always located in the same position. Once the participant successfully navigated to the area where the platform was located, a message on the computer displayed \u201cPlatform found.\u201d If the platform was not located within 60\u2009sec, the platform became visible and the following message was displayed on the screen: \u201cThe platform is visible, swim to it.\u201d The next trial began 1\u2009sec after the previous trial ended (1\u2009sec intertrial interval (ITI)). After completion of the Learning trials, the Probe trial began, in which the platform was removed from the virtual environment unbeknownst to participants. The probe trial ended after participants navigated around the environment for 30\u2009sec. \n\nThe Retrieval Condition was similar to the Learning condition and participants were instructed to navigate to the hidden platform as quickly as they could. The platform was always located in the same location as during the learning condition. During the Motor Control condition, each participant completed 2 blocks of visible platform trials (4 trials per block, each trial beginning from a different location). The platform was visibly above the surface of the water and participants were instructed to navigate to the platform as quickly as possible, without paying attention to environmental landmarks. The location of the platform was the same as in the hidden condition, thereby minimizing the potential for encoding novel information during navigation in the environment. The scanning sequence lasted for 360\u2009sec and consisted of alternating \u201con\u201d (4 active \u201con\u201d periods) and \u201coff\u201d periods (5 rest \u201coff\u201d periods). During the \u201con\u201d periods participants navigated through the virtual environment and completed as many trials as possible within each of the four 60\u2009sec \u201con\u201d periods. Therefore, the number of completed trials varied between participants. During \u201coff\u201d periods, participants viewed a black screen that displayed the message \u201cplease wait for instructions\u201d ( ). \n\nDependent measures for Learning, Retrieval, and Motor Control conditions on the WMT included path length, navigation latency, and first movement latency. Path length (relative to pool diameter) was measured as the distance to reach the platform. Navigation latency was measured as the total time (sec) to complete the task minus the total elapsed time (sec) prior to the first movement. Latency to first movement was measured as the time (sec) before the participant initiated navigation in the pool. Path length (distance to the platform), navigation latency, and latency to first movement measures were averaged across trials per block for the Learning, Retrieval, and Motor Control conditions. For the Probe trial, dependent measures included percent of total distance traversed within the correct platform quadrant (NE), reflecting as an index of spatial learning, and heading error towards the platform, calculated as the angular deviation from a straight path to the center of the platform from the starting position. Heading error was measured at the first occurrence that participant distance was greater than 25% of the pool diameter from the starting position. The number of trials completed during the Retrieval and Motor Control conditions was also recorded. \n\nTwo independent raters blind to participant diagnosis rated navigation strategies used by participants during the Probe trial. The strategy chosen to solve the water maze could affect behavioral performance [ ]. Participant navigation strategies were rated as a direct strategy, where participants navigated directly to the platform location, or a nondirect strategy, where participants navigated in a circuitous or random route that was not in the direction of the platform quadrant (NE) ( ). Interrater reliability for strategy coding was   r   = .53,   P   = .004 (Pearson's   r   correlation coefficient, two-tailed). \n\n\n### 2.2. Functional MRI Acquisition \n  \nFunctional MRI scanning was performed on a 3T Siemens Trio whole-body MR scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), using a birdcage quadrature RF head coil for acquisition of echo planar imaging (EPI) blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI. Sagittal scout images were first acquired for alignment and localization using a fast spin echo sequence (FSE) with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 3\u2009msec, echo time (TE) = 40\u2009msec, field of view (FOV) = 20\u2009cm, matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64, slice thickness = 7\u2009mm (1\u2009mm gap), and flip angle = 90\u00b0. Images were acquired from the whole brain using the following parameters: 100 images per slice using a single-shot, gradient pulse-echo sequence, slice thickness = 5\u2009mm, 0\u2009mm skip, flip angle = 90\u00b0, TE = 30\u2009msec, and TR = 3000\u2009msec. For each participant, matched T1 and T2 EPI image sets were also obtained: T1-matrix size = 256 \u00d7 256, TR = 5760\u2009msec; TE = 80\u2009msec, number of shots = 4, flip = 90\u00b0; T2-matrix size = 256 \u00d7 256, TR = 6680\u2009msec, TE = 75\u2009msec, number of shots = 4, flip = 90\u00b0; 64 \u00d7 64 image matrix, 3\u2009mm \u00d7 3\u2009mm in plane resolution. In order to maximize the amplitude of the task-induced signal intensity changes, a gradient echo pulse sequence was utilized.The virtual water maze environment was projected via an LCD video projector (Resonance Technology Inc., Northridge, CA, USA) onto a translucent screen located at the rear of the bore, visible to subjects using a mirror mounted on the head coil. \n\n\n### 2.3. Functional MRI Analyses \n  \nSPM5 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College, London, UK) was run in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) for analysis of functional MRI data. To correct for motion in BOLD fMRI data, an intrarun realignment algorithm was utilized, which uses the first image as a reference. An exclusionary criterion of 2\u2009mm of head motion in any direction was used. An EPI template in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotactic space was employed to normalize the realigned images, which were resampled into 2\u2009mm cubic voxels. To spatially smooth the normalized images, an isotropic Gaussian filter (full width half maximum [FWHM] = 10\u2009mm) was then applied [ ]. In SPM5, high-pass temporal filtering, with a cut-off of 128\u2009sec was applied, and serial autocorrelations were modeled using an AR(1) model. Global scaling was not utilized. Using the framework of the general linear model, statistical analysis for individual subjects was performed [ ,  ] using a box-car reference function convolved with the hemodynamic response function. \n\nThe motor control condition of the water maze paradigm was used as a control condition since there was no learning or memory component (i.e., subjects simply navigate to the visible platform). Age was entered as a covariate into the analysis. To identify brain areas activated during hidden conditions, predetermined condition effects were calculated at each voxel by the fixed model and a single image of mean activation for Retrieval-Motor Control was created for each subject. The group data were then analyzed using a random-effects model on a second level to account for interindividual variance. Comparisons between groups (NU > MJ; MJ > NU) were performed using a two-sample   t  -test with a priori threshold of   P   < .005, uncorrected, with a minimum extent threshold (  k  ) set at 20 contiguous voxels. Anatomic regions (hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and cingulate gyrus) for the region of interest analyses were automatically defined using the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas [ ] in SPM5 using a threshold of   P   < .05 and   k   = 20. Thresholds were based on previously published methods used in BOLD fMRI studies of MJ users [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n### 2.4. Statistical Analysis \n  \nOne-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to compare MJ users and NU on demographic, clinical measures, cognitive measures, and behavioral measures. SPSS 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for all statistical analyses (  \u03b1   = .05). Two-way (Group \u00d7 Block) repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted for path length, navigation latency, first movement latency on WMT Learning trials. One-way ANOVAs were conducted for all other WMT performance measures. Chi-square nonparametric analyses were conducted to compare navigation strategies, that is, direct strategy versus the nondirect strategy, between groups. Significant group differences were observed for age (  F  (1,27) = 5.0,   P   = .03) and education (  F  (1,27) = 5.10,   P   = .03), and, therefore, fMRI analyses included age as a covariate. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Demographic Variables \n  \nAs illustrated in  , data for the MJ group confirm near daily MJ use, as indicated by ASI scores of MJ use in the last 30 days, smoking episodes per week, total grams of MJ used per week and average urinary cannabinoid levels (ng/mg). MJ users also reported very low scores (out of a total 36) on the MWC, suggesting no significant withdrawal symptoms were present on study day. \n\n\n### 3.2. Clinical and Cognitive Measures \n  \nNo significant differences were observed between the groups for IQ, as measured by WASI, or for mood, as measured by the HAM-A, or on PANAS (positive or negative affect subscales) ( ). Further, no significant performance differences were detected between the MJ and NU groups on the Mental Rotation Test Total Score, or on the SBSOD Total Score ( ). \n\n\n### 3.3. Virtual Water Maze Behavioral Performance \n  \n#### 3.3.1. Pre-fMRI Hidden Platform Trials: Learning \n  \nThere was a significant effect of Block (  F  (3, 78) = 5.1,   P   < .005), with both groups displaying shorter path lengths to reach the hidden platform by the fourth block ( ). For navigation latency, there also was a significant main effect of Block (  F  (3,78) = 3.8,   P   < .05), again with both groups displaying shorter navigation latencies to successfully complete the trial with increasing number of completed trials (Block 1: 16.0 \u00b1 9.2; Block 2: 11.0 \u00b1 6.9; Block 3: 12.9 \u00b1 13.2; Block 4: 9.8\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4). There was a significant main effect of Block (  F  (3, 78) = 17.1,   P   < .001) for latency to first movement, with both groups displaying shorter latencies to initiate movement by the fourth block (Block 1: 5.6.0 \u00b1 1.8; Block 2: 4.1 \u00b1 1.8; Block 3: 4.1 \u00b1 1.7; Block 4: 3.8 \u00b1 1.9). No interactions Block \u00d7 Group interactions reached statistical significance for any of these measures. \n\n\n#### 3.3.2. Pre-fMRI Probe Trial: Retention \n  \nThe Group effect for Retention trended towards significance, with MJ users displaying a lower percentage of total navigation distance within the NE (correct) platform quadrant on the Probe trial relative to NU (41.6% \u00b1 15.6 versus 50.7% \u00b1 10.6, resp.; include   F   value,   P   = .08). Heading error did not differ significantly between MJ and NU groups (27.9 degrees\u00b0 \u00b1\u200928.6 and 20.6\u00b0 \u00b1 21.5, resp.). \n\n\n#### 3.3.3. fMRI Hidden Platform Trials: Retrieval \n  \nThe number of hidden platform trials completed during fMRI did not differ between groups, with MJ users completing 10.3 \u00b1 3.6 and NU completing 11.4 \u00b1 2.7 hidden platform trials during fMRI BOLD acquisition. Despite a lack of difference in the number of trials completed, there was a significant group effect for latency to first movement. MJ users demonstrated shorter latencies to first movement (3.2\u2009sec \u00b1 1.2) relative to NU (4.6 \u00b1 1.6) (  F  (1, 26) = 5.9,   P   < .05) and longer path lengths to reach the hidden platform (MJ: 1.7 \u00b1 1.5 versus NU: 0.8 \u00b1 0.4;   F  (1, 26) = 4.8,   P   < .05). There were no significant group differences for navigation latency (MJ users: 15.1 \u00b1 12.9; NU: 9.9 \u00b1 5.5). \n\n\n#### 3.3.4. fMRI Visible Platform Trials: Motor Control \n  \nThe number of visible platform trials completed also did not differ between groups, with MJ users completing 15.7 \u00b1 1.3 and NU completing 15.0 \u00b1 1.4 visible platform trials during fMRI BOLD acquisition. There were no significant group differences observed for path length (MJ users: 0.5 \u00b1 0.1; NU: 0.4 \u00b1 0.01), navigation latency (MJ users: 3.9 \u00b1 0.5; NU: 3.9 \u00b1 0.7), or latency to first movement (MJ users: 3.3 \u00b1 1.4; NU: 4.4 \u00b1 1.7). \n\n\n#### 3.3.5. fMRI Navigation Strategies \n  \nThere was a significant preference observed for the use of a direct versus a nondirect strategy during the Probe Trial in the NU group, with 78% (  n   = 14) employing a direct search strategy and 22% (  n   = 4) employing a nondirect strategy (  \u03c7  (1,18) = 5.6,   P   < .05). A strategy preference was not observed in the MJ group, 50% (  n   = 5) utilized a direct strategy and 50% (  n   = 5) utilized a nondirect strategy. \n\n\n#### 3.3.6. fMRI BOLD Activation \n  \n Whole-Brain Analysis: Retrieval-Motor Control Condition  . NU, relative to MJ group, demonstrated greater BOLD activation in the bilateral inferior frontal pars triangularis and bilateral inferior frontal pars opercularis, left superior frontal gyrus, left superior frontal pars orbitalis, bilateral middle frontal gyrus, right pallidum, and right putamen for the Retrieval-Motor Control contrast ( ). However, the MJ group relative to NU did not show greater BOLD activation in any region ( ).  \n\n Region of Interest Analysis: Retrieval-Motor Control Condition  . NU, relative to MJ group, displayed significantly greater BOLD activation in the right parahippocampal gyrus (cluster size (  k  ) = 26,   x   = 24,   y   = \u22124,   z   = \u221228,   P  \u2009\u2009uncorrected = 0.018) for the Retrieval-Motor Control contrast ( ). However, no significant group differences in BOLD activation were detected in the hippocampus. In addition, MJ users demonstrated no regions of greater BOLD activation relative to the NU group in either the parahippocampal gyrus or hippocampus. For the exploratory analysis of the cingulate gyrus, the NU group relative to the MJ group also demonstrated greater bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus and bilateral midcingulate gyrus activation ( ), however, MJ users showed no greater activation in this area relative to the NU group ( ). \n\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThis pilot study compared current, chronic MJ users and NU during performance of a virtual water maze task of spatial learning and memory. While task performance on learning trials was similar between groups, there was a trend for MJ users to display a lower percentage of total navigation distance within the correct quadrant during the probe trial relative to NU, suggesting a subtle difference in memory retention. During performance on hidden trials during fMRI, although the number of completed trials did not differ between groups, MJ users exhibited significantly longer path lengths and shorter latencies to first movement, which also indicates a deficit in memory retrieval. Performance on visible trials did not differ between groups, however, suggesting that groups had comparable motor abilities. Visuospatial perception (i.e., mental rotation) and environmental spatial ability (i.e., Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale) also did not differ between groups, which is consistent with a previous investigation that failed to find differences in orientation skills   in MJ users   [ ]. Importantly, this first pilot fMRI investigation of water maze performance in current MJ users revealed that in addition to some behavioral performance differences during memory retrieval, brain activation patterns differed significantly during task performance, with MJ users demonstrating less BOLD activation in the right parahippocampus and the cingulate gyrus relative to NU. \n\nThe parahippocampal area is necessary for the processing associations between landmark objects and the environment (landmark-based memory), or contextual memory [ ]. In the current study, the NU group demonstrated greater recruitment of the parahippocampus during the retrieval of the hidden platform location, which was located between two relevant landmarks (e.g., abstract paintings) within the environment, which provides consistent support for this brain region being involved in spatial navigation in healthy adults [ ]. Although there are no existing data on MJ effects on BOLD activation during a spatial memory task, alterations in hippocampal activation in MJ users relative to nonusers have been reported for nonspatial, associative memory tasks. Jager and colleagues [ ] reported that despite normal memory performance, abstinent MJ users displayed hypoactivity in the hippocampal/parahippocampal area compared to NU during the learning phase of a pictorial memory pairing task [ ]. In contrast, hyperactivation of the hippocampal/parahippocampal area was reported during the learning phase in a face-name matching task in MJ users compared to nonusers [ ]. Similarly, hyperactivation in the left parahippocampal gyrus was observed during the encoding of face-profession pairs in high-frequency versus low-frequency MJ users [ ]. Overall, these data suggest evidence for hippocampal/parahippocampal activation differences associated with MJ use during the performance of memory tasks, although memory for objects versus memory for faces may underlie the MJ-related differences in the direction of BOLD activation effects (hypoactivation versus hyperactivation) across these previously published studies. \n\nIn the present study, exploratory analysis of the cingulate gyrus revealed greater activation of the anterior cingulate and the midcingulate gyrus during memory retrieval in the NU group compared to the MJ group. The anterior cingulate cortex is an executive region that plays a critical role in modulation of attention, with reciprocal connections with the amygdala, providing support for its role in arousal and motivation [ ]. These preliminary data suggest that NU may differentially activate this frontal region to meet the attentional demands posed by this task, which subsequently leads to a greater utilization of attentional resources during memory retrieval as compared to MJ users. These findings are consistent with previous studies, in which frontal hypoactivation was observed in MJ users relative to nonusers [ ]. Nestor and colleagues [ ] demonstrated hypoactivation in the frontal gyrus in MJ users relative to nonusers during the learning phase in a face-name association task. The majority of remaining available data on brain activation differences associated with MJ use are based on investigations of spatial working memory, which employs a different neural circuitry that is more frontally mediated, compared to more traditional memory tasks that involve the medial temporal lobe. Nonetheless, adolescents with recent MJ use exhibit greater activation of the medial and left superior prefrontal cortex and bilateral anterior insula, despite similar task performance, and as compared to an abstinent group and nonusers during the performance of a 2-back spatial working memory task [ ]. In addition, young adult MJ users were reported to demonstrate greater activation in the inferior and middle frontal gyri, as well as the right superior temporal gyrus, an area not typically recruited for visual spatial working memory during the performance of a visuospatial 2-back working memory task [ ]. Long-term heavy MJ users also exhibit increased activation in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate, as well as the basal ganglia, compared to non-users, during performance of a spatial working memory task [ ]. Taken together, these data suggest that MJ users exhibit altered neural functioning during spatially-related cognitive challenges, with deficits being observed in both frontal and temporal cortices and suggesting evidence for compensatory and adaptive functioning to overcome inefficient activation of the neural network associated. \n\nBrain activation changes associated with MJ use appear to be task specific, with some studies demonstrating hyperactivation, suggestive of increased recruitment, and other studies demonstrating hypoactivation, suggestive of inefficient neural networking [ ,  ,  ]. Overall, studies that have reported hyperactivation of brain areas suggest functional compensation and possible neural recruitment of additional brain areas [ ]. Alterations in brain activation (e.g., hypoactivation) can also be affected by differences in cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) [ ]. Studies using dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging (DSC MRI) have provided important insight into the effects of marijuana on cerebral hemodynamics, demonstrating that while CBV levels begin to normalize with continued abstinence from marijuana in frontal areas, temporal and cerebellar brain regions show slower CBV decreases [ ,  ]. These findings have important implications for understanding the effects of changes in the microvasculature blood volume and/or blood flow that can affect fMRI BOLD signal in chronic marijuana users and nonusers [ ,  ]. \n\nAt least in the current study, the strategy chosen to solve the water maze could have affected behavioral performance [ ]. A significantly greater percentage of NU than MJ users employed a direct navigation strategy, which relies on spatial cues and is the most efficient means to reach the platform quadrant. Indeed, only half of the MJ users used a direct approach to complete the task, which may have contributed to the trend for worse performance on the Probe trial and greater path lengths during retrieval. It is plausible that choosing a less efficient strategy to solve the water maze could have likewise contributed to differences in BOLD activation during spatial navigation. These preliminary findings should therefore be replicated in a larger sample of MJ and NU subjects, which would permit the ability to examine strategy choice in relationship to BOLD activation during spatial memory task performance. \n\nThere are a number of strengths and weakness associated with this pilot study. A strength of this study is that it is the first investigation of hippocampal brain activation during the performance of a virtual analogue of the well-established Morris water maze task in MJ users, who were well characterized, clinically diagnosed with marijuana abuse, and who did not meet criteria for any other substance abuse disorders. Furthermore, self-report of marijuana use was confirmed by urine drug toxicology screen and results from the SCID and the MWC suggest that in this sample of chronic, heavy MJ smokers, they were not experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms at the time of assessment. In terms of limitations, only a modest number of subjects were examined in this pilot study, which limits generalizability and precludes the ability to examine sex differences within the groups. Performance measures of spatial ability typically have large variability and, therefore, the current investigation should be replicated using a larger sample of subjects. However, despite the modest sample size, significant BOLD activation differences in the parahippocampal and cingulate region were detected. Although differences in age may have been a potential confound, fMRI analyses were corrected for age and differences remained significant between groups. The MJ group also endorsed more alcohol and tobacco use than the NU comparison group, albeit at modest, nonclinical levels. Nonetheless, effects on BOLD activation cannot be ruled out, particularly since nicotinic alpha-7 acetylcholine receptors are highly distributed in the hippocampus [ ] and alcohol use has been reported to block the induction of long-term potentiation in hippocampal rat slices [ ]. Although subjects from the current study were well characterized with regard to their clinical, demographic and MJ-use status, formal personality testing was not completed with instruments designed to specifically assess Axis II pathology, which may impact neurocognitive performance. It is of note, however, that the majority of these subjects (80%) were enrolled in a separate, multiweek study, which repeatedly assessed clinical state through clinical scales and interviews, and none appeared to meet criteria or demonstrate any symptoms of a personality disorder [ ,  ]. In terms of fMRI data processing, the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas was used to define region of interest (ROIs). It is difficult to localize activation in small areas such as the hippocampus, since areas such as the parahippocampal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and lingual gyrus surround this area. Thus, the atlas map chosen for analysis could have contributed to varied results across studies. \n\nThe length of the period of abstinence from marijuana use has been shown to impact performance on memory tasks and brain function [ ]. Even though, the MWC suggests that the MJ users are not experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms, it cannot be discounted that the observed group differences could still reflect residual effects of MJ use and may account for the disparate findings amongst studies. While the MJ users in the Jager et al. study [ ] were abstinent for at least 7 days prior to testing, participants in the current pilot study abstained for only a minimum of 12 hours. Regardless, both studies demonstrated hypoactivation of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus in MJ users relative to nonusers during a learning and memory task. In order to examine the potential adverse effects of MJ use on neural activity beyond a week of abstinence, a logical next step to this work would be to examine subjects who have undergone a longer period of abstinence to explore whether functional changes in BOLD signal between MJ users and NU result from potential washout effects associated with drug abstinence. \n\nIn summary, data from this pilot study demonstrate significant differences in BOLD activation in MJ users compared to a NU comparison group during memory retrieval on a spatial navigation task. These data suggest that MJ users utilize neuronal resources in a manner that differs from NU, as suggested by the observed hypoactivation of the/parahippocampal area during navigation, but perhaps also from frontal hypoactivation due to the attentional demands of the task. Further research is warranted to determine the potential mechanism of action by which MJ use may affect brain activation during memory retrieval. Nevertheless, the current findings demonstrate that MJ use exerts a significant effect on neural activity, which is relevant to public health concerns associated with understanding the long-term consequences of chronic marijuana use on brain function in young adults. Indeed, altered brain function in the absence of gross behavioral performance differences may be an early indicator of future long-term consequences associated with continued use, particularly given that relatively short history of MJ use in the current study sample. Early alterations in neuronal function may potentially be related to the later manifestation of MJ-related cognitive impairments, as well as an increased risk for psychiatric conditions [ ], which underscores the need for additional investigations focusing on the neurobiological consequences of MJ use. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tMJ (n = 10)\tNU (n = 18)\nAge (years)\t20.3 \u00b1 3.6\t22.8 \u00b1 5.0\nAge (years)\t(Age range: 18\u201330)\t(Age range: 18\u201333)\nEducation (years)\t13.4 \u00b1 1.5\t15.5 \u00b1 2.4\nEthnicity (Caucasian/non-Caucasian)a\t9/0\t11/7\nSESb\t43.4 \u00b1 10.6\t49.1 \u00b1 12.2\nAge of MJ onset\t15.6 \u00b1 1.2\t\u2014\nSmokes per week\t10.7 \u00b1 5.5\t\u2014\nGrams per weekc\t4.8 \u00b1 4.9\t\u2014\nDuration of use (yrs)\t4.0 \u00b1 2.4\t\u2014\nASI (MJ use out of 30 days)\t25.5 \u00b1 4.0\t\u2014\nMWC\t2.0 \u00b1 2.1\t\u2014\nTHC (ng/mL)\t193.5 \u00b1 219.2\t\u2014\n### Caption\nDemographic and marijuana use data.\n### Footer\nData represent mean \u00b1 standard deviation.

WM encoding and WM retrieval have not been investigated in schizophrenia without the confounds of illness chronicity or the use of antipsychotics and illicit substances. Moreover, it is unclear if WM deficits may be linked to cannabinoid 1 receptor dysfunction in schizophrenia. Sixty-six volunteers (35 controls, 31 drug-free patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) completed the Sternberg Item-Recognition paradigm during an fMRI scan. Neural activation during WM encoding and WM retrieval was indexed using the blood-oxygen-level-dependent hemodynamic response. A subset of volunteers (20 controls, 20 drug-free patients) underwent a dynamic PET scan to measure [ C] MePPEP distribution volume (ml/cm ) to index CB1R availability. In a whole-brain analysis, there was a significant main effect of group on task-related BOLD responses in the superior parietal lobule during WM encoding, and the bilateral hippocampus during WM retrieval. Region of interest analyses in volunteers who had PET/fMRI indicated that there was a significant main effect of group on task-related BOLD responses in the right hippocampus, left DLPFC, left ACC during encoding; and in the bilateral hippocampus, striatum, ACC and right DLPFC during retrieval. Striatal CB1R availability was positively associated with mean striatal activation during WM retrieval in male patients (  R  \u2009=\u20090.5,   p  \u2009=\u20090.02) but not male controls (  R  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.20,   p  \u2009=\u20090.53), and this was significantly different between groups,   Z  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.20,   p  \u2009=\u20090.02. Striatal CB1R may contribute to the pathophysiology of WM deficits in male patients and have implications for drug development in schizophrenia. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nVerbal working memory (WM) deficits are a stable component of the cognitive deficit seen in schizophrenia [ ] that predict poor clinical [ ] and functional outcomes [ ]. However, the neurobiology underlying WM impairments remains poorly understood and unaddressed by current treatments [ ]. Identifying the pathophysiology underlying impairments in WM is therefore important for the development of pharmacological treatments targeting WM deficits in schizophrenia. \n\nWM, the temporary storage and manipulation of information, is comprised of distinct processes including encoding, maintenance and retrieval [ ]. Studies using the Sternberg Item-Recognition paradigm (SIRP), able to disentangle the effects of WM encoding and WM retrieval, have shown that healthy volunteers show greater task-dependent blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses during WM encoding in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventral striatum, left hippocampus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral parietal cortex; and greater BOLD signal during WM retrieval in the bilateral parietal cortex, bilateral ttemporal cortex and the posterior cingulate [ ]. \n\nWhile numerous studies have investigated WM in schizophrenia [ ], few studies have used paradigms that are able to investigate WM encoding and retrieval mechanisms separately [ \u2013 ], and those that have, typically fail to model them separately [ \u2013 ] or do not report findings for both WM encoding and retrieval [ ]. While one study investigated WM encoding and retrieval in anti-psychotic-treated, male patients with chronic schizophrenia [ ], groups were not matched on performance. \n\nIn this context, anti-psychotic treated patients relative to controls showed lower activation during WM encoding in the inferior and middle frontal gyri, but greater activation during WM retrieval in the left hippocampus, left striatum and the right inferior and frontal gyri [ ]. However, it is unclear if group differences [ ] may be related to the effects of anti-psychotic medication, substance use, illness chronicity or poor task engagement. \n\nMice deficient in cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) on GABAergic interneurons exhibit WM deficits [ ]. Moreover, alterations in peripheral CB1R mRNA levels have been associated with poor cognitive performance [ ]. We recently showed that patients with schizophrenia show fewer cortical CB1Rs, where lower levels are associated with poorer cognitive functioning [ ]. Moreover, medication-na\u00efve FEP patients, who do not use cannabis, show greater levels of the endogenous CB1R agonist, anandamide [ ], shown to impair memory retrieval in rodents [ \u2013 ]. \n\nWe aimed to investigate the neural basis of both WM encoding and WM retrieval, and their relationship to CB1R availability. We predicted that patients relative to controls would show lower CB1R availability [ ,  ] and altered functional activation during WM encoding and WM retrieval [ ]. Taking together findings that CB1R modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity underlying memory [ \u2013 ] and literature showing an association between CB1R availability and behavioural measures of cognition in schizophrenia [ ], we predicted that CB1R availability would be associated with the neural correlates of WM. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Design \n  \nA cross-sectional design was used. The neural correlates of WM were investigated in males and females, as well as males alone. Due to sex differences in CB1Rs [ ], we investigated CB1Rs in males, with the view of investigating females in future. The PET data, but not the fMRI or PET-fMRI relationships, were recently reported [ ]. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nSixty-six volunteers including 31 patients with drug-na\u00efve/free first episode psychosis (FEP) (mean [SD], age, 26.64 [4.68] years; 26 males, 5 females) and 35 healthy volunteers (mean [SD] age, 27.12, [5.32] years; 26 males, 9 females) matched on age (age \u00b13 years) and sex were included. Patients were recruited from early intervention services for psychosis and healthy volunteers were recruited via local advertising in London, United Kingdom. A power calculation indicated that a sample size of 20 volunteers per group would have >80% power to detect a relationship of   R  \u2009=\u20090.35,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (two-tailed) (see supplementary for full details). \n\n\n### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nPatients met the following criteria: (1) <3 years of illness onset; (2) mental capacity to consent; and (3) diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder [ ]. Healthy volunteers met the following criteria: (1) no current/lifetime history of an Axis I disorder, as determined by the Structured Clinical Interview of DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders (SCID) [ ]; (2) and no family history (first/second-degree) of an Axis I disorder [ ]. \n\nExclusion criteria for all volunteers were as follows: (1) current/lifetime history of substance abuse/dependence, as determined by the SCID [ ]; (2) substance use within the last month; (3) positive result on a urine toxicology test detecting THC metabolites for up to 30 days (50\u2009ng/ml cut off) or a positive result on a test detecting cocaine, amphetamine, cannabis, opiates and benzodiazepines; (4) head injury leading to loss of consciousness; and (5) contraindications to MRI safety. \n\n\n### Measures \n  \n#### Clinical and demographic variables \n  \nAge, sex, ethnicity, current/previous alcohol, nicotine and illicit substance use, age of illness onset/duration were recorded. Clinical symptom severity was determined using the Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS) [ ]. \n\n\n#### Neuroimaging \n  \n##### Sternberg Item-Recognition Paradigm (SIRP) \n  \nHigh-resolution T1-weighted images and the SIRP were acquired on a General Electric MR750 3.0 tesla scanner (see supplementary materials for neuroimaging acquisition parameters). The SIRP, shown to have good reliability [ ], was used to investigate WM [ ]. The task comprised of (1) encoding trials, where volunteers were instructed to memorize sets of letters; (2) retrieval trials, where volunteers indicated whether they had seen the letters previously; and (3) rest trials (see supplementary materials for details and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0  for a paradigm schematic). \n\n\n##### Cannabinoid 1 receptor availability \n  \nAs reported elsewhere [ ], a CB1-selective radiotracer, [ C]MePPEP using arterial blood sampling, was used to measure CB1R availability [ ] (see supplementary materials for neuroimaging acquisition parameters). \n\n\n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nStatistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS; Version 22) [ ]. Data normality was assessed using the Shapiro\u2212Wilk test; and equality of variances were assessed using the Lavene\u2019s test. \n\n#### Behavioural data analysis \n  \nGroup differences in categorical and continuous variables were determined using chi-square and independent samples   t   tests, respectively. \n\n\n#### fMRI analysis \n  \nData were analysed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM-12; Version 6684) [ ] using Matlab 8.5 [ ]. Frame-wise displacement was calculated used methods described previously [ ]. High velocity motion spikes were regressed out by including scan nulling (censoring) regressors for volumes with volume-to-volume frame-wise displacement greater than 0.5\u2009mm. A standard pre-processing pipeline was implemented (see supplementary materials for methods). The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response was modelled using an event-related design where a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) was convolved with regressors encoding the onset and duration for the following ten conditions: encoding load (EL) 1, EL 3, EL 5, EL 7, EL 9, retrieval load (RL) 1, RL 3, RL 5, RL 7, and RL 9. Rest trials were left un-modelled and served as an implicit baseline. Individual fixed-effects analyses were performed for each participant to identify regional differences in relative activation using the following linear contrasts of parameter estimates: EL 3-1, 5-1, 7-1 and 9-1 and RL 3-1, 5-1, 7-1 and 9-1. To investigate group differences in the neural correlates of WM, a 2 (group: patient vs. control)\u2009\u00d7\u20094 (load: 3-1, 5-1, 7-1 and 9-1) ANOVA was conducted for encoding and retrieval, respectively, controlling for age, sex and mean frame-wise displacement. Independent samples   t   tests were also used to investigate group differences in (1) mean frame-wise displacement and (2) task response accuracy (% of overall correct responses). \n\nWhole-brain analyses were conducted using the full sample (  N  \u2009=\u200966) including males and females, as well as males only (  N  \u2009=\u200952). Whole-brain and region of interest (ROI) analyses were repeated in male volunteers (  N  \u2009=\u200940) who had PET/fMRI, in order to permit the investigation of the association between CB1R and the neural correlates of WM in the same volunteers. ROI analyses were conducted for the ACC, hippocampus and striatum, defined using a standard probabilistic atlas [ ]. Since this atlas [ ] does not include the DLPFC, ROI analyses conducted for the DLPFC were defined using Brodmann areas 9 and 46 [ ] using the WFU PickAtlas Toolbox ( ). These ROIs were selected based on findings that WM encoding activates the bilateral ACC, striatum, hippocampus and DLPFC in controls [ ] and findings indicating that CB1R agonists administered to the striatum [ ,  ], hippocampus [ ,  ] and medial prefrontal cortex impair memory in rodents [ ]. \n\nA result was deemed significant if it survived family-wise error (FWE) correction on the basis of the peak-level extent (pFWE\u2009<\u20090.05). Mean BOLD signal was extracted using the MarsBar toolbox ( ) using independently derived ROIs [ ]. Mean BOLD signal for encoding and retrieval trials were extracted for whole-brain grey matter, defined using the WFU PickAtlas Toolbox ( ) in order to investigate data normality and equality of variances. \n\n\n#### PET analysis \n  \nA standard pre-processing pipeline was implemented (see supplementary materials for methods). CB1R availability was indexed using the distribution volume (  V  ) of [ C]MePPEP using the Logan graphical method with a metabolite-free arterial plasma input function [ ]. CB1R availability was investigated in the same ROIs that were used for the fMRI ROI analyses. A 2 (group)\u2009\u00d7\u20094 (region: DLPFC, ACC, hippocampus, striatum) repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to investigate group differences in CB1R availability. \n\n\n#### PET and fMRI analyses \n  \nPearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the association between CB1R availability and (1) performance accuracy; and (2) the linearity of the load-dependence of the BOLD response during WM encoding and WM retrieval (for each subject, we fitted a linear regression model (intercept and slope) and took the slope as our measure of linearity of the BOLD response, as a function of task difficulty (separately for encoding and retrieval)). Bonferroni corrections were applied. Levels of statistical significance were   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 for all tests (two-tailed). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and clinical data \n  \nAll data were normally distributed. There were no group differences in age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status, years of education, body mass index, current cannabis, alcohol or tobacco use (see Table\u00a0 ).   \nSample clinical and demographic characteristics showing that there were no group differences between healthy volunteers and first episode psychosis patients in age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status, body mass index, cannabis, alcohol or tobacco use. \n  \n N   sample size,   SCZ   schizophrenia,   SCZA   schizoaffective disorder,   PANSS   Positive and Negative Syndrome scale,   t   (independent samples   t  -test),   x   (chi-square test), degrees of freedom (  df  ),   NA   not applicable,   SD   standard deviation \n\nYears of education: calculated as the years of education after compulsory education (minimum compulsory education in the United Kingdom is 12 years) \n\nSocio-economic status: High\u2009=\u2009high, intermediate and lower grade professionals; medium\u2009=\u2009small employer, self-employed and lower technical occupations; low\u2009=\u2009sales, routine occupations, unemployed; student\u2009=\u2009student \n  \n\n\n### Sternberg Item-Recognition fMRI Paradigm \n  \n#### Performance \n  \nThere were no significant group differences in performance accuracy on load 1 (t(64)\u2009=\u20091.44,   p  \u2009=\u20090.15) or 7 (t(64)\u2009=\u20091.95,   p  \u2009=\u20090.06) but there were group differences on loads 3 (t(64)\u2009=\u20092.32,   p  \u2009=\u20090.024), 5 (t(64)\u2009=\u20092.69,   p  \u2009=\u20090.01) and 9 (t(64)\u2009=\u20092.70,   p  \u2009=\u20090.01). These findings did not survive Bonferroni corrections. Relative to controls (M\u2009=\u20090.14\u2009mm; SD\u2009=\u20090.07), patients (M\u2009=\u20090.21\u2009mm; SD\u2009=\u20090.17) showed greater total frame-wise displacement (t(64)\u2009=\u2009\u22122.12,   p  \u2009=\u20090.04). \n\n\n#### fMRI analyses \n  \n##### Data normality and equality of variance \n  \nAll fMRI data were normally distributed. There were no differences in the variances for fMRI data between groups (see supplementary table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n##### Encoding \n  \nIn a whole-brain analysis of encoding trials (35 controls, 31 patients), there was a significant main effect of group in the left angular gyrus, left superior parietal lobe; and a significant main effect of WM load in the lingual gyrus and the posterior cingulate gyrus (see Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). These findings remained unchanged when restricting the analysis to male volunteers (26 controls, 26 patients) (see Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). \n\nIn a whole-brain analysis of encoding trials (PET-fMRI subset), there was a significant main effect of group in the right middle temporal gyrus and frontal gyrus; and a significant main effect of WM load in the left superior parietal gyrus and the left middle frontal gyrus (see Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). In ROI analyses of encoding trials, there was a significant main effect of group in the right hippocampus, left DLPFC and the left ACC; and a significant main effect of WM load in the left striatum, bilateral DLPFC and the bilateral ACC (see Table\u00a0  for full results).   \nRegion of interest analysis of the effects of working memory encoding and working memory retrieval in all male healthy volunteers (  N  \u2009=\u200920) and male patients with first episode psychosis (  N  \u2009=\u200920) who had PET and fMRI when controlling for age, sex and frame-wise displacement. \n  \n H   hemisphere,   L   left,   R   right,   MNI   Montreal Neurological Institute,   CS   cluster size,   p  *   p   value surviving family-wise error (FWE) correction on the basis of peak-level extent \n  \n\n\n##### Retrieval \n  \nIn a whole-brain analysis of retrieval trials (35 controls, 31 patients), there was a significant main effect of group in the bilateral hippocampus and the left posterior cingulate (see Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). These findings remained unchanged when restricting the analysis to male volunteers (26 controls, 26 patients) (see Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). In a whole-brain analysis of retrieval trials (PET-fMRI subset), there was a significant main effect of group in the left hippocampus, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, bilateral putamen, right anterior cingulate gyrus and the left caudate (see Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). In ROI analyses of retrieval trials, there was a significant main effect of group in the bilateral striatum (see Fig.\u00a0 ), bilateral hippocampus, right DLPFC and bilateral ACC (see Table\u00a0  for results).    Statistical parametric maps showing that a main effect of group in the striatum during working memory in first episode psychosis patients relative to healthy volunteers ((MNI coordinates:   x  \u2009=\u200930,   y  \u2009=\u20092,   z  \u2009=\u2009\u22128); F\u2009=\u2009\u200934.32,   Z  \u2009=\u20095.43, cluster size\u2009=\u2009201,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001).  \nThese findings survived family-wise error (FWE) correction on the basis of the peak-level extent (pFWE\u2009<\u20090.05). The colour bar shows the   t   statistic. \n  \n\n\n\n\n### CB1R availability \n  \nData were normally distributed. There was no difference in the variances between groups (see Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). In a 2 (group)\u2009\u00d7\u20094 (region: DLPFC, ACC, hippocampus, striatum) repeated measures ANOVA, there was a significant effect of group (F(1,38)\u2009=\u20094.61,   p  \u2009=\u20090.03) and region (F(1,38)\u2009=\u200927.43,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). However, the group\u2009\u00d7\u2009load interaction was not significant (F(1,38)\u2009=\u20090.47,   p  \u2009=\u20090.50). \n\n\n### Association between CB1R availability and working memory \n  \nThere were no significant associations between performance accuracy and CB1R availability (see supplementary materials). However, male patients showed a significant positive association between striatal CB1R availability (see Fig.\u00a0 ) and mean linear load-dependent responses of striatal BOLD signal during WM retrieval (  R  \u2009=\u20090.50,   p  \u2009=\u20090.02; see Figs.\u00a0 \u2013 ) but male controls did not (  R  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.15,   p  \u2009=\u20090.53). However, neither of these findings survived Bonferroni corrections. The association in patients remained significant, when controlling for mean performance accuracy (  R  \u2009=\u20090.39,   p  \u2009=\u20090.04). However, this association fell short of statistical significance (  p  \u2009=\u20090.05) when restricting the analysis to volunteers who had PET and MRI scans <10 days apart (see supplementary materials). There were no other significant associations (see Supplementary Tables\u00a0 \u2013  for full results).    Statistical parametric maps showing that cannabinoid 1 receptor availability, as determined by the distribution volume of [ C] MePPEP, is significantly lower in the striatum in patients relative to controls.  \nResults are show using a height threshold   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 for visualization purposes. The colour bar shows the   t   statistic. \n     The associtation between striatal CB1R availability and the striatal neural correlates of working memory retrieval.  \n a   Association between the distribution volume of [ C]MePPEP in the striatum (ml/cm ) and mean load-dependent striatal BOLD signal during WM retrieval (beta values) during working memory in the striatum in healthy volunteers and   b   patients with first episode psychosis. A Fisher   r  -to-  z   transformation indicated that these relationships were significantly different between groups,   Z  \u2009=\u2009\u22122.20,   p  \u2009=\u20090.02 (two-tailed). \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur main finding was that male patients relative to male controls showed altered functional activation during WM encoding in the DLPFC, ACC and hippocampus and altered functional activation during WM retrieval in the DLPFC, ACC, hippocampus and striatum. Interestingly, the same male patients showed fewer cannabinoid 1 receptor levels in these brain regions relative to healthy volunteers. Moreover, male patients showed a positive association between striatal CB1R availability and load-dependent functional activation in the striatum during WM retrieval. \n\nConsistent with previous literature [ ], WM encoding was associated with greater task-related BOLD responses in the hippocampus and striatum. However, our finding that controls showed greater striatal and hippocampal activation during WM retrieval was not shown previously [ ]. Instead, greater task-related BOLD responses during WM retrieval in the parietal, temporal and cingulate cortices have been reported in controls [ ]. Since we used peak-level thresholding, this discrepant finding may be explained by the use of cluster-extent thresholding in this previous study, shown to have poor spatial specificity and increase false positive rates [ ]. \n\nOur finding that patients showed greater activation during WM retrieval in the left hippocampus and the left caudate in drug-free patients is consistent with findings in anti-psychotic-treated, chronic male patients [ ]. However, our finding extends this work by showing that drug-free/na\u00efve FEP patients show altered activation during WM retrieval. Although our finding that patients show greater activation in the middle frontal gyrus during WM encoding is at odds with literature reporting decreased activation in this region during WM encoding [ ], this previous study showed group differences in performance accuracy which may indicate poor task engagement in patients [ ]. \n\nOur finding that patients showed lower CB1R availability in regions implicated in memory [ ] is consistent with previous work using arterial blood sampling [ ,  ], but is at odds with a study that failed to use arterial blood sampling [ ], necessary for the reliable estimation of the radiotracer kinetics [ ]. Our finding that patients show lower CB1R levels, in the context of functional alterations during WM, is consistent with literature demonstrating that CB1R-deficient mice exhibit WM deficits [ ,  ]. Moreover, our finding that CB1R levels were not associated with behavioural measures of WM is also consistent with literature showing that peripheral CB1R mRNA levels were not associated with WM [ ]. \n\nA recent meta-analysis indicated that central levels of CB1R agonist, anandamide, are elevated in patients with psychotic illnesses [ ]. Moreover, the acute administration of partial CB1R agonist, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, consistently induced WM deficits in healthy volunteers in a systematic review of 35 human studies [ ]. Previous work has also shown that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol induces greater WM deficits in schizophrenia relative to healthy individuals [ ]. While it is unclear if higher levels of endogenous CB1R agonists precipitate CB1R down-regualtion in psychosis, the chronic exposure to CB1R agonists, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, down-regulates CB1R levels in humans. Moreover, CB1R knockout mice, who are deficient in CB1R on GABAergic interneurons, show WM deficits [ ]. \n\n### Strengths and limitations \n  \nA strength of the study was that patients were anti-psychotic na\u00efve/free and satisfied criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, shown to have good diagnostic stability [ ,  ]. A limitation of our study, inherent to all cross-sectional designs, is that we are unable to determine if CB1R alterations are causally implicated in cognitive impairments. Future longitudinal studies using pharmacological interventions, that modulate CB1R availability, are needed to determine whether CB1R agonist-mediated reductions in CB1R availability [ ] induce WM impairments in humans. A limitation of the study was that CB1R availability was only investigated in male volunteers. Given sex differences in CB1R availability [ ] and sex differences in the behavioural and functional effects of cannabinoids on neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity [ ], we specifically investigated the association between CB1R and WM in males to reduce the effect of sex as a source of variability. However, future studies are needed to determine if our findings generalize to female patients. \n\nPET and MRI scans were conducted as closely together as possible. However, due to limited scanner availability, these scans were approximately 1 month apart. Since test\u2212retest data indicates that CB1R availability, as determined by the VT of [ C]MePPEP, remains stable between 1 and 309 days [ ], the delay between the two scans is unlikely to impact the variability of the VT. When restricting the analysis to volunteers who had PET and MRI scans less than 10 days apart, we observed a trend-level association between striatal CB1R availability and mean linear load-dependent BOLD responses in the striatum during memory retrieval. This association is likely to have fallen short of statistical significance (  p  \u2009=\u20090.05) since the sample was statistically underpowered, in accordance with our power calculation. \n\nSince the endocannabinoid system dynamically changes in response to cannabis use [ ], we ensured that all subjects had negative urine drug screens prior to both scans and that subjects with current substance or a history of substance abuse/dependence were excluded. However, future studies should use simultaneous PET-fMRI scanners to improve the integration of multimodal imaging data. \n\nWhile some subjects had previously used cannabis, 1 month of abstinence normalizes CB1R levels [ ] and there were no associations between CB1R levels and prior cannabis use [ ]. Similarly, although tobacco use may influence CB1R levels [ ], there were no group differences in tobacco use or associations between CB1R levels and tobacco use [ ]. \n\nAlthough we were able to disentangle the effects of WM encoding and WM retrieval, WM maintenance was not modelled. Future studies could address this by imposing a longer delay between encoding and retrieval blocks. Although performance was not included in the model, the association between striatal CB1R availability and striatal fMRI BOLD responses remained unchanged when controlling for performance. However, this finding did not survive Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. Moreover, while patients showed greater frame-wise displacement relative to controls, we controlled for frame-wise displacement in all fMRI analyses and thus, this is unlikely to be a significant confound. \n\nGiven findings indicating that behavioural and functional measures of WM are associated with functional polymorphisms in the cannabinoid 1 receptor (  CNR1  ) gene [ ,  ], a limitation was that we were unable to investigate functional polymorphisms in the   CNR1   gene and how they may be linked to CB1R and WM in schizophrenia. \n\n\n### Implications for understanding the neurobiology of working memory deficits \n  \nOur finding that patients show greater activation during both WM encoding and WM retrieval, in the context of no significant differences in performance, suggests that patients may utilize greater levels of neural activity to achieve levels of performance comparable to controls. \n\nOur findings show that WM encoding and WM retrieval processes are both altered in the early stages of schizophrenia without the confounds of substance use [ ] and anti-psychotic medication [ ]. Moreover, our finding that striatal CB1R availability is associated with altered striatal fMRI activation during WM retrieval in drug-na\u00efve/free FEP patients extends preclinical literature demonstrating that CB1R agonists administered to the striatum impair memory [ ,  ]. Since this association was exclusively shown in patients, but not controls, striatal CB1R dysfunction may precipitate an adaptation in the normal mechanisms underlying WM retrieval in the early stages of psychosis. \n\nOur finding that striatal CB1R availability was associated with striatal activation during WM retrieval may be due to the unique topographical organization of striatal CB1R. CB1R are densely distributed on GABAergic interneurons in the striatum, where they inhibit GABA release [ ,  ], a mechanism known as depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition [ ]. By contrast, CB1R are predominately localized on glutamate neurons in the hippocampus [ ] and pyramidal neurons in the cortex [ ], where they inhibit glutamate release, a mechanism known as depolarization-induced suppression of excitation [ ]. The regional specificity of our findings may therefore indicate that WM impairments in schizophrenia are linked to alterations in the disinhibition of synaptic transmission, arising from striatal CB1R dysfunction on GABAergic interneurons. This adds to other neurochemical evidence implicating the striatum in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia [ \u2013 ]. \n\nSince CB1R regulate neurotransmitter release by inhibiting N-, P- and Q-type calcium channel openings and by activating inwardly rectifying potassium channels [ ], fewer CB1R may disrupt the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission underlying long-term potentiation [ ,  ]. These findings identify the CB1R as potential target for the treatment of WM impairments in FEP. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nRelative to controls, drug-na\u00efve/free FEP patients exhibit functional alterations during WM encoding and WM retrieval. In contrast to controls, patients showed a positive association between striatal CB1R availability and mean load-dependent striatal functional activation during WM retrieval. These findings identify altered striatal CB1R availability and striatal neural correlates of WM retrieval in the pathophysiology of WM impairments in FEP. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tHealthy volunteers\tFirst episode psychosis patients\tt/x2/U\tdf\tp\nN\t35\t31\t\t\t\nAge mean (SD), years\t27.12 (5.32)\t26.64 (4.68)\tt\u2009=\u20090.52\t64.0\t0.6\nSex (male/female)\t26/9\t26/5\tx2\u2009=\u20091.18\t2.0\t0.55\nEthnicity (Caucasian/Black African or Black Caribbean/ Asian/ Mixed/missing)\t15/3/11/4/2\t12/0/6/3/0\tx2\u2009=\u20098.49\t6.0\t0.2\nYears of education after compulsory education mean (SD)a\t4.01 (3.81)\t3.01 (2.59)\tt\u2009=\u20091.63\t58.0\t0.11\nSocio-economic status (high/medium/ low/unemployed/ student/missing data)b\t3/4/10/1/13/4\t1/2/13/5/7/3\tx2\u2009=\u200924.38\t20.0\t0.23\nBody mass index mean (SD) score\t25.12 (3.81)\t25.65 (5.10)\tt\u2009=\u2009\u22120.41\t46.0\t0.68\nCurrent cannabis use (yes/no)\t0/35\t0/31\t\t\t\nCurrent alcohol use (yes/no/missing data)\t21/12/2\t17/13/1\tx2\u2009=\u20092.88\t4.0\t0.6\nCurrent tobacco use (yes/no/ missing data)\t10/23/2\t13/17/1\tx2\u2009=\u20093.14\t4.0\t0.53\nDiagnosis (schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder)\t\t28/3\t\t\t\nIllness duration mean (SD), months\t\t22.39 (12.80)\t\t\t\nDuration of prior treatment mean (SD), months\t\t6.16 (10.10)\t\t\t\nCurrent use of antipsychotics (yes/no)\t\t31/0\t\t\t\nPrior use of antipsychotics (yes/no)\t\t23/8\t\t\t\nPANSS positive mean (SD) score\t\t25.83 (14.90)\t\t\t\nPANSS negative mean (SD) score\t\t24.10 (7.53)\t\t\t\nPANSS general mean (SD) score\t\t40.45 (10.20)\t\t\t\nPANSS total mean (SD) score\t\t86.82 (21.83)\t\t\t\n### Caption\nSample clinical and demographic characteristics showing that there were no group differences between healthy volunteers and first episode psychosis patients in age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status, body mass index, cannabis, alcohol or tobacco use.\n### Footer\nN sample size, SCZ schizophrenia, SCZA schizoaffective disorder, PANSS Positive and Negative Syndrome scale, t (independent samples t-test), x2 (chi-square test), degrees of freedom (df), NA not applicable, SD standard deviationaYears of education: calculated as the years of education after compulsory education (minimum compulsory education in the United Kingdom is 12 years)bSocio-economic status: High\u2009=\u2009high, intermediate and lower grade professionals;

Nevertheless, some profoundly deaf individuals do learn to read at age-appropriate levels. The question of what differentiates proficient deaf readers from less-proficient readers is poorly understood but topical, as efforts to develop appropriate and effective interventions are needed. This study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain activation in deaf readers (N\u200a=\u200a21), comparing proficient (N\u200a=\u200a11) and less proficient (N\u200a=\u200a10) readers\u2019 performance in a widely used test of implicit reading. Proficient deaf readers activated left inferior frontal gyrus and left middle and superior temporal gyrus in a pattern that is consistent with regions reported in hearing readers. In contrast, the less-proficient readers exhibited a pattern of response characterized by inferior and middle frontal lobe activation (right>left) which bears some similarity to areas reported in studies of logographic reading, raising the possibility that these individuals are using a qualitatively different mode of orthographic processing than is traditionally observed in hearing individuals reading sound-based scripts. The evaluation of proficient and less-proficient readers points to different modes of processing printed English words. Importantly, these preliminary findings allow us to begin to establish the impact of linguistic and educational factors on the neural systems that underlie reading achievement in profoundly deaf individuals. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe orthographic representation of English encodes relationships between the sound-based properties of English words and conventionalized graphemic forms. As profoundly -deaf individuals often lack the ability to hear word forms of spoken English, a deaf learner\u2019s ability to master the sound-form mappings is often hampered. Though this mapping in English is not fully transparent, decades of research with normally hearing children indicates that the appreciation of the relationship between visual symbols and the sounds these visual forms represent is often highly predictive of reading success  \u2013 . However, while some profoundly deaf individuals do learn to read and process written English at levels comparable to their normally hearing peers, little is known about how these readers ultimately succeed in this task. In this study, we compare proficient deaf readers and less-proficient deaf readers in an attempt to characterize the patterns of brain activity that may differentiate these understudied groups. \n\nAlthough opinions differ significantly  ,  , two prevailing hypotheses about how deaf readers attain reading success can be identified. The most common assumption is that successful deaf readers are those who have obtained some degree of phonological awareness of English that is sufficient to provide a consistent mapping between visual letters and English words  . Support for this phonological hypothesis comes from the finding that, despite profound hearing loss, some deaf individuals obtain above-chance performance on English-based phonological tasks such as rhyming, even when orthographic similarity does not provide clues to sound-based similarity  \u2013 . As might be expected, some of these studies have also reported a relationship between English phonological skills and reading  ,  ,  , but see also  . It is often assumed in these cases that the successful deaf reader is in fact making use of auditory, articulatory, and perhaps visual properties of English phonology in forming relationships between print and meaning. Though not a necessary condition of the phonological hypothesis, it is reasonable to assume that these skilled deaf readers engage largely similar neural regions during reading as their hearing counterparts  . The assumption here is that while there may be subtle differences due to the distribution of effort required for relating visual symbols to lexical meaning, the fundamental cognitive processing is likely to be quite similar. Under this view, the successful deaf reader has simply been able to master the same mapping strategies utilized by hearing individuals, albeit at times with some compensatory strategies for inferring sound forms, such as a greater reliance on the articulatory and visual properties of oral English. \n\nA second, though less well-developed, class of hypotheses posit that some successful deaf readers have mastered reading through a qualitatively different process than hearing individuals. Under one formulation, deaf individuals do not decompose English words into constituent sounds, but rather they are able to map directly between visual word forms and lexical-semantic representations  ,  . In some aspects, this hypothesis appears to be similar to the \u201cwhole-word\u201d reading approach popularized by Goodman   and Smith  . However, proponents of this view suggest that the end result is a mapping not to English-based representations per se, but to semantic representations that underlie native-language abilities, which for many deaf individuals in the United States is American Sign Language  ,  . Proponents of this view suggest that deaf readers may resemble non-native (i.e. L2) speakers reading English, especially when early language preferences are based in signed languages. In support of this hypothesis, studies have shown that native (L1) competence in a sign language is a good predictor of success in English reading  \u2013  and that there is evidence for activation of ASL forms during the processing of English word forms  . \n\nThe idea that an alternative and non-phonologically based mapping between visual form and meaning exists is ensconced in the classic dual route models of reading, and in the more nuanced and complex implementations thereof  . The motivation for a non-phonological route for reading is based, in part, from consideration of the acquired dyslexias, specifically the syndrome known as deep dyslexia. Deep dyslexic readers are characterized by a constellation of reading errors which include impaired abilities to read non-words aloud, the presence of reading errors that are based in visual similarity (tribute \u2192 tribe; thing \u2192 thin), and additional unusual semantic errors (cart \u2192 horse; slope \u2192 snow). It is of further interest to note that deep dyslexics also make orthographic errors in spelling, which have been taken as evidence of lexical mediation across output domains (oral reading, writing, etc.)  . Collectively, these reading errors are thought to reflect the inability to make use of phoneme-to-grapheme routines and an over-reliance on the visual and semantic properties of print forms. \n\nStudies of deaf readers\u2019 spelling errors suggest that deaf subjects make more phonologically implausible errors than hearing counterparts (responsible \u2192 responbile; medicine \u2192 medince). While this may indicate a lack of appreciation of English phonotactics, they nevertheless tend to be orthographically legal. The sources of the observed spelling error patterns are difficult to categorize but likely reflect multiple constraints such as those on permissible syllable forms  . In their examination of deaf spelling errors, Olson and Caramazza   note that spelling patterns were not strongly predicted on the basis of purely visual-based frequency effects governing orthographic regularity as might be expected. For example, less common letter combinations are not replaced by more frequently occurring bigrams in these data. However, the visual-based frequency discounted by Olson and Caramazza is but one of many possible indications of an over-reliance on visual word form properties, and more work is needed to fully characterize the distribution and development of spelling errors in deaf subjects and how these patterns may reflect their processing of text. \n\nConsideration of theories which suggest non-phonologically mediated routes of reading in deaf subjects have several implications for neural systems which may support successful reading in deaf signers. First, researchers have suggested that the non-phonological reading exhibited by deep dyslexics reflects a non-optimal right hemisphere visual language processing strategy  ,  . However, reading abilities observed in deaf readers have not implicated right hemisphere compensatory strategies. Second, theories which posit that deaf readers are making use of L1 ASL representations in their understanding of English print independently suggest differences in the neural representation of reading in deaf signers. For example, several studies have indicated that in hearing populations L2 reading engages the primary language areas associated with L1 written language processing, often to a greater extent  ,  . While research has shown that sign language processing calls upon left-hemisphere perisylvian regions in much the same way as spoken language processing  , there remain subtle differences reported for ASL especially in the distribution of activations in posterior temporal-parietal regions. For example it has been shown that ASL processing in native signers recruits both the left and right posterior parietal regions  \u2013 , and that lesions to the right hemisphere can lead to impairments in the use of spatial-linguistic properties of ASL  . If skilled deaf readers are relying upon a mapping from English orthographic form to ASL semantic representations, it is reasonable to assume that this strategy would evoke activation in left hemisphere perisylvian language areas common to English and ASL, as well as regions believed to be unique to ASL processing, for example right hemisphere inferior parietal regions. Whether this same pattern of result would hold for less successful deaf readers is unclear. \n\nFinally, whether successful deaf readers decompose English words into constituent sounds or process written English in a whole-word fashion, it is germane to consider the influence of the orthographic system itself. An emerging literature suggests that neural activation may be differentially distributed as a function of the form of script used  ,  . For example, research has shown that reading alphabetic scripts engenders more left-hemisphere fusiform processing whereas logographic writing systems like Chinese activate fusiform gyri bilaterally  . Moreover, studies have shown that the processing of logographic scripts evokes relatively greater activation in the left middle frontal gyrus (MidFG) while phonologically based scripts engender relatively greater activation in the left inferior frontal opercular region associated with phonological processing  . These script-based activation discrepancies are thought to reflect the differences in cognitive processing required for alphabetic words, which are predominantly read out by assembling fine-grained phonemic units (i.e., by assembled phonology)  ,  , as opposed to the phonological codes resultant from logographic orthographies (i.e. addressed phonology) which are thought to arise after the visuo-orthographic information of the appropriate lexical candidate has been identified  . To the extent that orthographic forms for deaf readers are essentially non-canonically \u201cassembled\u201d they may show activation in neural regions which are more reflective of logographic scripts, which would give rise to differences in early temporal-ventral visual processing regions as well as differences in MidFG and opercular regions. \n\nThe consideration of experiential factors of deafness, coupled with theoretical models of reading in normal and disordered populations have led us to make several predictions regarding the neural regions which support the processing of orthographic word forms in English. To the extent that deaf readers are using some type of decomposition that entails aspects of phonological processing (whether auditory, visual or articulatory) we suggest these readers will show activations similar to that of hearing readers. Specifically we predict that we should find activation in left inferior frontal gyrus and left posterior-temporal regions. Conversely, under the premise that deaf readers are using qualitatively different means for understanding written words, we might expect neural activations that differ from hearing peers. These differences may manifest in several ways. First, to the extent that deaf readers mirror the strategies of acquired dyslexia (i.e. individuals who have lost the ability to use a phonologically mediated form for reading), we expect greater contributions of the right hemisphere. Second, if deaf readers are making reference to ASL representations during reading we expect English forms to activate L1 processing, which would include both left hemisphere perisylvian regions as well as language-specific right hemisphere activation, particularly in tempo-parietal regions. Finally, to the extent that deaf readers are using strategies akin to the reading of logographic scripts we expect to see activation in early temporal-ventral visual processing regions as well as differences between opercular and MidFG regions relative to what is traditionally reported for readers of alphabetic scripts. Finally, it is possible that a single modal pattern does not underlie both proficient and less-proficient deaf readers. Indeed relative degrees of proficiency may result in qualitatively different patterns between these subgroups of deaf readers. \n\nIn the following study, two groups of deaf readers were presented with English words and unrecognizable \u201cfalse font\u201d forms (see   for discussion and Supplementary materials for examples). In both cases, subjects were asked to analyze only visual characteristics of the stimuli by indicating whether each form had \u201ctall\u201d letters (those which ascended above the midline of the written forms). While both real English words and false fonts should recruit the same degree of low-level visual form processing, it is presumed that English words automatically and irrepressibly engage further lexical processing  . Characterizing the differences in processing between these two conditions allows for the identification of regions which contribute uniquely to reading above those responsible for decomposing complex orthographic stimuli. Furthermore, the patterns of activation between groups of proficient and less-proficient readers are compared, which sheds light on the processing strategies characteristic of these subgroups deaf readers. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe fMRI data reflect a summary statistics approach of random-effects models appropriate when inferences are to be applied to the entire population. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed with Group (proficient vs. less-proficient readers) and Lexicality (words vs. false fonts) as factors. We examine significant main effects of lexicality reporting responses to words and false fonts. We then report a statistical group interaction that reveals neural regions that were more active in proficient readers than less-proficient readers during word reading compared to false fonts. A further investigation into the effects of reading proficiency is highlighted by consideration of a separate group analyses of proficient and less-proficient deaf readers (see   section for details). Please refer to   &   for a list of activation foci and significance values for all comparisons. \n   List of all activation foci in group analysis.           List of all activation foci in the subgroup analyses.        \n### Group Results \n  \nMain effects for Group and Lexicality were significant (both F(1,32)\u200a=\u200a9.09, p<0.005)). A Group\u00d7Lexicality interaction was also significant (F(1,38)\u200a=\u200a7.35, p<0.01). Post hoc analyses were performed to analyze the contributions of individual groups and stimulus conditions. These results are presented below. \n\n#### Positive effect: Words \n  \nAn analysis of the positive effect of words (T(1,38)\u200a=\u200a2.43, p<.01, k\u200a=\u200a10) resulted in large regional activation in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), including the operculum (BA 45; peak at \u221253, 21, 26) with extension to the left middle frontal gyrus (BA8) as well as activation in the right medial frontal gyrus (BA10; peak 16, 39, 8). Prominent bilateral activation was also found in the anterior cingulate cortex (peaks at 1, 10, 26; \u221213, 43, 4),the left cerebellum, and left middle temporal gyrus (BA 22; peak \u221267, \u221236, 0). \n\nThe pattern of activity involving the left inferior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus and the bilateral cingulate gyri is consistent with foci of reported in   which used the same task. However, in our data, inferior frontal gyrus activation was limited to the left hemisphere, while the activation reported in   is more ventral and bilateral. \n\nThe activation of the left frontal operculum has emerged as a consistent cluster in the meta-analysis of ortholinguistic activity reported in  . This region has been extensively described as being involved in aspects of semantic retrieval and selection processing  \u2013 . In the context of the present experiment, this provides evidence that the implicit reading task is sufficient to engage aspects of semantic evaluation of word forms in deaf readers. \n\nThe activation of the anterior cingulate, a region commonly associated with error and conflict monitoring  ,  , is greater in the context of monitoring for critical visual features in the presence of words rather than to meaningless false font word forms. In a fashion similar to the color Stroop task, automatic engagement of reading abilities in the task likely interferes with the attempt to make visual feature judgments. The suppression of the irrelevant dimension (in this case, reading) may result in greater anterior cingulate participation relative to the false font task, where no such implicit lexical activation is possible. \n\n\n#### Positive effect: False fonts \n  \nThe positive effect for false fonts (T(1,38)\u200a=\u200a2.43, p<.01, k\u200a=\u200a10) showed overall less activation, and revealed a pattern more consistent with the simple processing of visual stimuli. The comparison reveals right hemisphere activation in the inferior occipital extrastriate region (peak at 34, \u221294, 8) which has been associated with feature analysis, especially when contrasted with low-level baselines. This has been observed in a variety of domains, including object recognition  , complex scene analysis  , graphical form analysis  ,  , and human action recognition  . \n\n\n#### Positive interaction: Group\u00d7Lexicality \n  \nIn evaluating the interaction of Group by Lexicality (T(1,38)\u200a=\u200a2.43, p<.01, k\u200a=\u200a10), we find several regions that show significantly greater activation for the proficient deaf readers during word processing (relative to false fonts) compared to the less-proficient readers during word processing (relative to false fonts). Activations included left middle frontal gyrus (peak at \u221210, 10, 44), bilateral-fusiform gyrus (peaks at \u221238, \u221254, \u221221; 37, \u221244, \u221225), the left superior and middle temporal gyrus (peaks \u221260, \u221215, 11; \u221249, \u221236, 0), bilateral supramarginal gyrus (left>right; peaks at \u221260, \u221240, 29 and 62, \u221226, 26), left anterior cingulate, and the right cuneus. There were no regions that showed greater activation for the less-proficient readers compare to the proficient readers in evaluation of this interaction. \n\nThe fusiform activations found here are within the range of locations reported for the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA; mean \u221242, \u221257, \u221215) which Cohen et al.   situated at the ventral junction between the occipital and temporal lobes. Originally, the VWFA was characterized as a specifically left-hemisphere region responsible for prelexical processing specific to words or word-like stimuli. In its original description, the VWFA was considered a region with considerable plasticity, tuned to the orthographic regularities that constrain letter combinations during the acquisition of literacy  ,  . In subsequent work, the category-specificity of this region has been challenged  , and research has further shown that a specialized visual analysis region may be seen in right hemisphere inferior temporal regions under some circumstances, as in the present case  \u2013 . Current views suggest that one property of this region is in the participation of segmentation and classification of visually presented stimuli  , an analysis which accords with our results. \n\nIt is important to note that this fusiform gyrus region showed greater activation in our proficient readers relative to the less-proficient readers. Several researchers have suggested that the responsivity of the VWFA is experience dependent  . Particularly relevant to our research is the observation that development of activation in VWFA is related to skill in reading, rather than maturation. Shaywitz and colleagues   reported that activation of the VWFA was positively correlated with standardized scores in grapheme\u2013phoneme decoding ability. Such findings have been taken as evidence that successful mastery of grapheme\u2013phoneme conversion (i.e. decoding) is a critical precursor to the development of the adult-like response properties of the VWFA  . \n\nA second region observed in this interaction was the left-hemisphere superior temporal gyrus (peak at \u221260, \u221215, 11). This region appears to lie proximal to temporal lobe region T1a (\u221256, \u221212, \u22123) reported in  . T1a is considered a \u201cvoice-specific area\u201d  , and is a common area of activation across phonological, semantic and syntactic judgments tasks suggesting this is a region for high-level linguistic integration. As discussed in  , T1a is argued to have a dorsal component more associated with abstract phonological processing and a ventral part involved in the processing of intelligible words  . This characterization appears apt as our deaf subjects, who are unable to process auditory speech, may nevertheless be able to process abstract properties of phonological structure. \n\nTo further explore group differences at a finer level of detail, separate random-effects models were estimated using the existing contrasts for the proficient and less-proficient readers. The data from these models is reported below. \n\n\n\n### Proficient Readers \n  \n#### Words \u2013 false fonts \n  \nFor proficient readers, activation for word stimuli over false font stimuli (p<.005, k\u200a=\u200a15) shows a stronger left-dominant pattern than in the previous full group results (see  ). This includes left Broca\u2019s area (peak \u221253, 21, 15) consistent with the activation found in the full group analysis as well as inferior opercular activation (BA 47, peak at \u221231, 36, \u22127). The opercular portion of Broca\u2019s region has long been implicated in spoken language phonological tasks, including maintenance in phonological working memory, as well as retrieval, manipulation, and selection of phonological representations  , \u2013 . Lexical access is known to rely in particular on Broca\u2019s region in the left inferior frontal cortex, involving areas 44 and 45  \u2013 . Recent work utilizing cytoarchitectonic probability maps   suggests that area 45 supports lexical selection processes whereas area 44 is more involved in lexical access via the segmental route to reading. A number of studies of signed language processing have reliably found activation in the left IFG which further speaks to the modality independence of Broca\u2019s region  ,  ,  . \n   Activations in proficient deaf readers for words versus false fonts, p<.005.    \nProficient readers also exhibited bilateral activation of middle superior frontal gyrus (BA8, peaks \u221220, 28, 40; 16, 36, 51). A wide variety of functions have been assigned to this region, which has traditionally been associated with occulo-motor activity involving frontal eye fields, including activation of left BA 8, and secondary motor areas related to speech  . It is interesting to note that activation in BA 8 has been previously reported in studies of speech reading  . \n\nAnother area of prominent activation was observed in bilateral middle temporal gyrus (MTG; peaks \u221267, \u221240, 0; 66, \u221233, \u22123) and adjacent right superior temporal sulcus (STS; peak 62, \u221211, \u22127). This posterior temporal region is commonly seen in tasks requiring word comprehension both in auditory and visual modalities  . As in the full group analysis, proficient readers showed robust activation in left posterior fusiform gyrus (\u221238, \u221244, \u221221) and anterior cingulate. \n\nFinally, a small region in the right cuneus (peak 8, \u221295, 15) was observed during the reading of words relative to false fonts. Activation of the cuneus is associated with higher level visual processing including action recognition   and visual reading  . The involvement of this region may reflect activation of higher level properties of the visual word stimuli, and/or co-activation of action routines associated with sign language interpretation. Further work is needed to specify the role of this visual processing region in signing deaf readers. \n\nOverall, the data from the proficient deaf readers suggests that these individuals are likely making use of neural regions for lexical recognition that are similar to those utilized by hearing individuals, in particular, involvement in the opercular region of the IFG which is suggestive of lexical selection, and the left-temporal lobe, often observed in studies of lexical semantics. \n\n\n#### False fonts \u2013 words \n  \nThe contrast between false fonts and words, produced no above threshold activation in our group of proficient readers. Activation at a reduced threshold was found only in the right middle occipital gyrus (peak 34, \u221294, 8), a region which has been reported in complex visual processing tasks, including reflecting on the physical appearances of famous persons   and visual memory for barcodes  , suggesting a role of this region in evaluation of high level visual properties. \n\n\n\n### Less-proficient Readers \n  \n#### Words \u2013 false fonts \n  \nExamination of the less-proficient deaf readers in the word versus false font contrasts (p<.005, k\u200a=\u200a15) reveals a markedly different pattern of activation. Prominent activity was observed in the anterior cingulate (12, 39, 11) during this condition. Smaller clusters of activity (p<.005, k\u200a=\u200a5) were located in and left and right middle and inferior frontal gyri BA46/9 (48, 21, 18), BA 44/9 (\u221253, 21, 26). This left inferior frontal gyrus activation lies dorsal to the IFG region observed in the proficient readers (see  ). In this analysis, activation was also observed in the pulvinar (12, \u221229, 15). \n   Activations in less-proficient deaf readers for words versus false fonts, p<.005.    \nThe activation of the left middle frontal cortex in language processing has been repeatedly demonstrated in fMRI studies of logographic reading using Chinese. In particular, left middle frontal activation has been obtained in word generation  , semantic judgment  , homophone judgment (compared to fixation)  , rhyme decision  , and syllable decision tasks  . In a meta-review exploring activation during reading of alphabetic languages versus Chinese, Tan et al.   concluded that the left MFG is responsible for addressed phonology in Chinese reading. The involvement of the MFG in our less-proficient readers may indicate that for these deaf readers the implicit recognition of word forms engenders processing similar to that found in Chinese readers processing logographic scripts. Specifically, these deaf subjects could be processing English word forms as non-decomposable logographic-like forms analogous to Chinese. \n\nThere are, however, some differences between the current findings and those of Chinese logographic reading. First, the less-skilled deaf subjects\u2019 activation was larger in the right hemisphere than left, whereas the results from the Chinese reading studies are clearly left hemisphere dominant. Second, we do not observe robust fusiform activation as might be expected (but see below). \n\nWhile right hemisphere activation in the IFG and MFG has occasionally been reported in tasks of alphabetic reading, leading some to suggest different roles for phonology across the left and right hemispheres, there is little consensus and a general underreporting of right hemisphere effects in alphabetic reading. Pugh et al.   reported a correlation between right hemisphere IFG activation during phonological processing and regularity and word length effects. Regularity effects refer to the relatively slower ability to read words with irregular phoneme-to-grapheme correspondences (e.g. leaf versus deaf). In many models of reading, the reading of irregular words is suggested to place greater demands on lexical-semantic processing. Similarly, word length effects refer to the sensitivity of reading speed to the word length as measured by number of characters. One interpretation of these data would suggest that right hemisphere activation is evoked under conditions of effort, where traditional routes to successful reading are taxed. Thus, the presence of right hemisphere activation seen in the less-skilled deaf readers, encompassing both IFG (BA 46) and MFG (BA 46/9), may be a signature of an inefficient reading strategy. Additional data from reading skill matched hearing controls would be a useful means to further understand this unusual pattern of neural activation in less-proficient deaf readers. \n\n\n#### False fonts \u2013 words \n  \nIn the less-proficient readers, activation for false fonts over words (p<.005, k 15) is again dominated by visual processing. This contrast produced robust bilateral ventral fusiform (peak \u221238, \u221290, \u22123) and right fusiform activation (peak 30, \u221233, \u221228) The right fusiform region appears to be related to the left-hemisphere homologue of VWFA (\u221244, \u221251, \u221216), often reported in visual word processing tasks  . Here again it is interesting to note a hemispheric reversal of typically reported coordinates for the VWFA in the less-proficient readers. \n\nThe relatively large magnitude of visual fusiform activation during the false fonts over words comparison in the less proficient deaf readers compared to the proficient readers is noteworthy. This may be an indication that these less proficient readers are in fact making use of differential visual based analyses for these unusual orthographic false font forms to a greater extent than the more proficient readers. Note that a more expected pattern of left-hemisphere fusiform activation is present in the proficient deaf readers during the words over false font comparisons. Further work is needed to clarify these distributional differences in response to orthographic forms in these populations. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn our study, we speculated that neural imaging studies of deaf readers may result in a number of possible activation outcomes. Based both upon past research with deaf and hearing readers we outlined three possibilities. First, to the extent that deaf readers were using a phonologically based avenue for reading, we might expect neural activation to appear largely similar to hearing readers, specifically with activation in the left IFG, and the posterior and middle temporal regions. Second, we suggested that if deaf readers were making significant use of native language abilities, patterns of activation during English reading should map on to regions independently observed for ASL processing, notably left perisylvian regions and right temporal-parietal regions. Finally, to the extent that deaf readers were using a strategy that circumvented segmental analysis in favor of whole word form processing, we predicted involvement of the left hemisphere MidFG and activation in early temporal-ventral visual processing regions. \n\nIn the overall group analysis, we observed activation of neural regions that were largely similar to those reported previously using this implicit word recognition task. Prominent activation of left MidFG (BA 45) suggests that lexical-semantic processing is being engaged by deaf readers through implicit word recognition when contrasted with false fonts. The contrast of the false fonts relative to words resulted in activation of the right inferior occipital extrastriate regions consistent with a visual feature analysis of these novel and complex stimuli. These data are important as they extend previous findings in studies which have used this implicit reading task to investigate lexical processing in hearing adults, children, and dyslexic readers. Our data provide evidence that this implicit reading task engages neural regions associated with lexical-semantic and visual feature processing in deaf readers. \n\nOne concern raised in the present study is the relative lack of robust patterns of activation in the fMRI data. As seen in the whole group analysis, even with 21 subjects, significance cluster-level values for this reading measure do not often survive corrections for multiple comparisons. Careful inspection of our data suggests considerable variability in this population (resulting in less-robust significance values at the group level), and this heterogenity provides support for the notion that proficient and less-proficient deaf readers may be engaging in differing reading strategies which should be studied in their own right. As further knowledge regarding subgroups of deaf individuals who may exhibit differing reading processing strategies begins to accrue, one may expect more homogeneity to emerge. However, given the paucity of data in this research field, we are purposely taking a less conservative approach in the present paper. The reader should be aware of the limitations associated with this decision. \n\nWhen deaf readers were divided in two groups on the basis of independently obtained reading levels, a particularly interesting finding emerged. In this analysis, we observed that proficient deaf readers activated the left IFG and the left STG in a pattern that is highly consistent with regions that have been reported in hearing readers. These data accord with the reports of Apracio et al.   and MacSweeney et al.   who also noted the prominent role of the left IFG in deaf readers during lexical decision and phonological judgment tasks. The MacSweeney et al.   report is of further interest due to the inclusion of a hearing dyslexic group in their study of pictorial rhyming. MacSweeny et al.   suggested that prominent left IFG activation is indicative of greater reliance on the articulatory component of speech during phonological processing when auditory processes are absent (deaf group) or impaired (dyslexic group). Thus, the brain appears to develop a similar solution to a processing problem that has different antecedents in these two populations. The differences in IFG foci between the deaf subjects (more ventral and superior) and the hearing dyslexics (more anterior and ventral) may reflect different degrees of reliance upon articulatory routines and lexical-semantic access in the service of these tasks. \n\nBased upon the multiplicity of functions now attributed to Broca\u2019s region (including its role in the mediation of sign language), one must exercise some caution in attributing left IFG activation to speech-articulatory processing. This point is underscored in the present study, where in contrast to the studies of Apracio et al.   and MacSweeney et al  , which included a more heterogeneous mix of deaf subjects who used a variety of preferred communicative methods (i.e. oral speech, cued-speech and sign language (LSF & BSL)), had mixed sign-proficiency levels (only four of the seven participants in the MacSweeney et al   study had deaf parents and were assumed to be highly proficient signers and had attended oral-based educational school programs), the present study included only deaf subjects who were highly sign proficient (including 8\u20139 native signers in each group), reported ASL as their preferred mode of communication, and attended residential schools with sign-based instruction. Thus, based upon anatomy alone one cannot assume that the proficient deaf readers were using an oral approach to reading. Rather, given the reported role of BA 45 in aspects of language segmentation in the service of lexical-semantic processing, it seems plausible that these individuals were engaged in a more compositional approach of word recognition in this task relative to the less-skilled readers. Additional work is required to further tease apart how the pedagogical approaches to reading instruction and language competencies influence cognitive routines and the subsequent engagement of reading networks in skilled deaf readers. \n\nThe less-proficient readers exhibited a pattern of response characterized by bilateral middle frontal lobe activation (right>left) and a lack of temporal and/or parietal lobe activation in the word versus false font comparisons. This limited activation appears qualitatively different from that reported by Gizewskiet al.   who examined reading in German deaf signers and hearing non-signers. The adult deaf subjects had good to excellent knowledge of German Sign Language (DGS) but self-reported weak to moderate levels of reading ability. The deaf subjects exhibited a mix of etiologies, including prenatal and postnatal deafened individuals with delayed exposure to sign language that ranged from 0\u20136 years (mean 4.4 years). In this study, read narratives were compared to a baseline of meaningless character strings. The narrative paradigm produced widespread activation, including the left angular gyrus, bilateral occipitotemporal areas, and frontoparietal secondary motor areas in the deaf readers. In contrast, no activation of left temporal lobe (BA 21) was observed. Recall that in our study, the presence of left superior temporal lobe activation differentiated proficient from less-proficient deaf readers. For less-proficient deaf readers, we speculated that word recognition may reflect a less successful whole-word approach to word recognition, one which does not seem to fully engage regions that support a semantic analysis. Moreover, we suggested the middle frontal regions observed seemed similar to, though more medial than, the homologous left hemisphere regions characteristic of logographic reading in Chinese readers, further raising the possibility that these individual are using a qualitatively different mode of orthographic processing than is traditionally observed in hearing individuals reading alphabetic scripts. Finally the robust activation of bilateral temporal fusiform region in the less proficient group during the processing of false fonts relative to alphabetic strings suggest a different emphasis on visual form analysis of grapheme forms. Taken together, the comparisons of proficient and less proficient deaf readers have given an indication that qualitatively different neural processes may be engaged during single word reading. \n\nTo conclude, the implicit word reading task has proven useful in beginning to explicate the systems that deaf readers use during reading. Considerable heterogenity was found in the overall group results, supporting an evaluation of proficient and less-proficient readers which points to different modes of processing in deaf readers\u2019 exposure to printed English words. Importantly, these preliminary findings allow us to begin to characterize the neural signatures related to linguistic and educational factors that underlie reading achievement in profoundly deaf individuals. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-one subjects participated in this study. Before beginning the experiment, written informed consent was acquired in accordance with the regulations of the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Davis. Subjects completed background questionnaires which included items relevant to exposure to ASL. Each subject was further administered an assessment of their English reading comprehension (PIAT, Reading Comprehension Subtest)   after the fMRI session was complete. Median PIAT score was 73, and this served as the basis for placing the subjects into either above-median (proficient) or below-median (less-proficient) groups. Groups were designated for analysis only, and had no effect on the experiment in terms of task. \n\nThe proficient group had eleven subjects (8 female) with an average PIAT score of 84.55 (SD\u200a=\u200a6.15) (mean grade equivalent: 8.7, mean age equivalent: 14). Age ranged from 19 to 46 (average 28.73, SD\u200a=\u200a9.90). Ten subjects reported right-hand dominance; one subject was left handed. Nine subjects were native ASL users as indicated in the background questionnaire; the two remaining subjects reported first using ASL at age 13. The less-proficient group had ten subjects (7 female) with an average PIAT score of 60.80 (SD\u200a=\u200a8.74) (mean grade equivalent: 4.0; mean age equivalent: 9.9). Age ranged from 19 to 45 (average 30.00, SD\u200a=\u200a10.27) and nine subjects reported right-hand dominance; one subject was left-handed. Eight of the below-median subjects were native ASL users, with the remaining two subjects reporting using ASL from ages 8\u20139 and 13 respectively. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nStimuli were composed of 40 English nouns and verbs (words) in standard lowercase orthography and 40 false font items (FF) both projected in black font on a white background. All word and FF items had five orthographic characters, and half of each set contained items with \u2018tall\u2019 letters (those which ascended above the midline of the word) as an experimental manipulation. FF items were created to match the original word stimuli in size, shape, distribution of ascending/descending letters, and overall orthographic frequency. These were created using items from previous implicit reading studies which utilize a font whose characters mimic English orthography in general composition, but are unrecognizable as known letters (see  ,   for discussion). See   and  . A list of all word stimuli used in the experiment is provided in Supporting Information  . A control condition which consisted of a black fixation cross on a white background was also included, and used as the baseline in analysis. \n   False fonts with no tall letters (corresponds to words \u201cmanor\u201d, \u201counce\u201d and \u201cgroom\u201d).       False fonts with tall letters (corresponds to words \u201cstole\u201d, \u201csnort\u201d and \u201cpulse\u201d).    \n\n### Experimental Design and Image Acquisition \n  \nThe experiment was comprised of alternating blocks of word and FF stimuli in two sets. Subjects were presented two alternating blocks of each stimulus type per set, which consisted of 10 unique stimulus items, randomly ordered. Each item was shown for 1 second, followed by 3 seconds of fixation. At the end of each block, the control condition was presented for 18 seconds. Completing the first set, subjects were allowed a break before beginning the second set. Both set order and block order within sets was counterbalanced across subjects. \n\nIn both word and FF conditions, subjects were asked to press a button to indicate whether the presented item contained a letter which ascended above the midline of the word (such as \u2018t\u2019, \u2018h\u2019, \u2018l\u2019, or \u2018d\u2019). All items required a yes/no button press response. Subjects were shown examples of word and FF items similar to those used in the task prior to scanning to ensure they understood the directions. None of the items used in training were included in the experiment. Each subject completed both sets, resulting in the presentation of 40 Word and FF items each. Each set took approximately 5 minutes to complete. Subjects also participated in a second study on ASL and gesture perception, discussed in a separate paper. \n\nImaging data was acquired on two Siemens Trio Tim 3T scanners located at the University of California, Davis Imaging Research Center in Sacramento, California and at the Rochester Center for Brain Imaging in Rochester, New York. A standard Siemens 8-channel head coil was employed in both locations, with added foam padding to minimize subject head movement during scanning. Four functional runs (two word/FF and two sign/gesture) and one structural image were acquired from each subject. Functional runs consisted of 89 volumes and were collected using a gradient echo EPI sequence (46 slices, thickness\u200a=\u200a3.6 mm, TR\u200a=\u200a3000 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a30 ms, flip angle\u200a=\u200a90-, FOV\u200a=\u200a230 mm\u00d7230 mm, voxel size\u200a=\u200a3.6 mm ). Functional volumes were aligned parallel to the anterior-posterior commissure (AC-PC line) and provided full brain coverage. The initial 8 fixation volumes acquired at the beginning of each run were discarded from analysis. \n\nDuring scanning, stimuli were presented via a Digital Projection Mercury 5000HD projector. The experiment was back-projected onto a screen placed at the foot of the scanner bed. A mirror mounted to the head coil and angled at approximately 45 degrees allowed subjects to comfortably view stimuli from inside the scanner bore. Each subject verified their ability to see the stimuli and adjustments were made to mitigate eye strain. Following the acquisition of functional images, a high-resolution structural image covering the entire brain was acquired using an MPRAGE sequence (208 slices, thickness\u200a=\u200a1 mm, TR\u200a=\u200a1900 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a3.06 ms, flip angle\u200a=\u200a7-, FOV\u200a=\u200a256 mm\u00d7256 mm, matrix\u200a=\u200a256\u00d7256, voxel size\u200a=\u200a1 mm ). \n\n\n### Data Analysis \n  \nData from all subjects was preprocessed before being submitted to statistical analysis using SPM8 (Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience). All volumes with large movement artifacts were removed from analysis. Remaining images were slice time corrected and realigned to each subject\u2019s mean image. Both structural and functional images were coregistered to the mean image, and normalized to the MNI template to enable group comparisons. Functional images were smoothed with an 8 mm  FWHM Gaussian kernel. \n\nA random-effects statistical model was used to quantify BOLD effects. First-level condition-related changes in regional brain activity were first estimated for each participant according to the general linear model fitted with the parameters for each condition (words, false fonts, fixation) and each subject\u2019s 6 realignment parameters included as regressors. Significant cerebral activations for the critical contrasts (Words-Fixation, False Font-Fixation) of interest were then examined at the second-level in SPM using a 2\u00d72 analyses of variance (ANOVA) with factors of Group (Proficient vs. Less-proficient) and Lexically (Words vs. False Fonts). Positive interactions for each group were tested using post-hoc T-tests with significance level of p<.01 uncorrected, and a 10 voxel cluster. In addition, separate random-effects models were estimated in SPM for the contrasts (Words-False Fonts) and (False Fonts-Words) for the proficient and less-proficient subjects respectively. Given the smaller sample size, unless otherwise noted, these individual contrasts were evaluated at p<.005 uncorrected, 15 voxel clusters. Values reported in the   &   reflect activations which exceed Z\u22653, p\u200a=\u200a.0013. \n\n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0054696-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nGroup\tContrast\tCluster size\tCoordinates\tt\tz\tp (uncorr.)\tApproximate locations\nAll subjects\tPositive effect: Words\t77\t1, 10, 26\t4.03\t3.65\t0.0\tAC (BA 32)\n\t\t55\t16, 39, 8\t3.92\t3.57\t0.0\tR MFG\n\t\t81\t\u22122 \u221236 \u221243\t3.92\t3.57\t0.0\tL Cerebellum\n\t\t146\t\u221253, 21, 26\t3.65\t3.35\t0.0\tL IFG (BA 45)\n\t\t103\t\u221267, \u221236, 0\t3.46\t3.20\t0.0\tL MTG\n\t\t53\t\u221213, 43, 4\t3.37\t3.13\t0.001\tL AC (BA 32)\n\tPositive effect: False fonts\t45\t34, \u221294, 8\t3.33\t3.10\t0.001\tR MOG (BA 18)\n\tPositive interaction: Proficient readers>Words>>Less-proficient readers>FFs\t217\t\u221210, 10, 44\t3.77\t3.45\t0.0\tL MFG\n\t\t208\t\u221260, \u221215, 11\t3.67\t3.37\t0.0\tL STG (BA 22)\n\t\t56\t\u221260, \u221240, 29\t3.53\t3.26\t0.001\tL SMG (BA40)\n\t\t67\t62, \u221226, 26\t3.19\t2.98*\t0.001\tR SMG (BA40)\n\t\t76\t\u221238, \u221254, \u221221\t3.31\t3.08\t0.001\tL Fusiform\n\t\t44\t\u221249, \u221236, 0\t3.21\t3.00\t0.001\tL MTG (BA22)\n\t\t91\t37, \u221244, \u221225\t3.35\t3.11\t0.001\tR Fusiform\n\t\t36\t26, \u221269, 15\t3.68\t3.38\t0.0\tR Cuneus\n### Caption\nList of all activation foci in group analysis.\n### Footer\nAC\u200a=\u200aanterior cingulate; IFG\u200a=\u200ainferior frontal gyrus; MFG\u200a=\u200amedial frontal gyrus; MTG\u200a=\u200amiddle temporal gyrus; MOG\u200a=\u200amiddle occipital gyrus; STG\u200a=\u200asuperior temporal gyrus; SMG\u200a=\u200asupramarginal gyru.

Method  : 24 adult persons (12 with phobia) were studied. The diagnosis of phobia was obtained with a structured interview and questionnaires. All participants were exposed to a 3D video presentation during an fMRI session.   Results  : The phobic group showed significant differential activations that were congruent with a dual route model of fear processing through the thalamus-amygdala (route I) and the thalamus-sensory and association cortex-entorhinal cortex-hippocampus-subiculum-amygdala (route II). Apart from this dual route, we also found differential activations in the globus pallidum, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, pars orbitalis, triangularis and opercularis of the frontal cortex, and cerebellum. Respect to non-phobic group, no activations were found in the insula or the anterior cingulate cortex.   Conclusions  : There seems to be a dual route depending on how persons with phobia to cockroaches process phobic stimuli. This double processing can have implications for the psychological treatment of specific phobias. \n \n\n# Body\n \nNeuroimaging studies of patients with mental disorders have been conducted with the main aim of providing evidence of the neurological bases of such diseases. Such knowledge is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the neuropsychological mechanisms of psychopathology and consequently to the improvement of psychological and biological treatments ( ;  ). Phobias are a type of anxiety disorder and refer to a high persistent anxiety response that people usually (but not always) consider excessive or irrational to the presence or anticipation of a threatening object or situation (American Psychiatric Association,  ). According to the APA, three groups of phobias (i.e., agoraphobia, social phobia, and specific phobias) are the most prevalent mental disorders overall. Of these, specific phobias have the highest prevalence rates, which range from 7% to 12.1% ( ;  ).   pointed out that small animal phobia is one of the most disabling phobias because there is a possibility of encountering the animal in everyday life. According to these authors, 40% of specific phobias are phobias of small animals. \n\nAs shown by systematic reviews ( ,  ) and meta-analyses ( ;  ), neuroimaging studies of phobias have found a group of similar brain areas and circuits to be related to brain responses to phobic stimuli. The areas most often found are those associated with limbic and paralimbic structures. The amygdala (especially the left amygdala) is the brain structure that has been found to be most closely associated with specific phobia in several studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, other brain areas have also been found to be activated by phobic stimuli. Such is the case of the left insula, cingulate gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and orbitofrontal cortex ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nThe differences between those studies illustrate the complexity of neurological processes in phobias. However, the differences found may also be due to the methodological characteristics of those studies. In fact, studies differ from one another in many ways. A few examples are the use of clinical or subclinical samples, the type of phobia, age, gender, the presence or absence of a control comparative group, and procedural differences. In this regard, not all studies used the same type of fMRI machine. Despite commercial differences, most of the studies used 1.5\u00a0T machines. Machines with higher spatial resolution such as the one used in this study\u20133 T\u2013allow a better delimitation of the brain structures detected and may explain some slight differences found between studies. There may also be specific effects depending on whether participants are shown pictures or a video presentation. \n\nConsidering the above, a more refined meta-analysis was performed of studies including an fMRI procedure whose participants included persons with small animal phobia and a healthy control group. The left amygdala and insular cortex were the brain areas found to be associated with the presence of phobic stimuli. Other structures involved in phobic responses were the fusiform gyrus, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the left cingulate cortex. Overall, this review found that the role of frontal areas seemed to be less stable than that of limbic areas ( ). Considering the findings of the above-mentioned review, the aim of the present study was to provide data about brain activation in individuals with specific phobia (i.e., cockroach phobia). To do so, we intended to compare a group of persons with cockroach phobia to a control group of individuals without phobia. The fMRI was performed while participants watched a 3D video presentation of the stimuli, cockroaches moving around, to enhance the sensation of presence. This study was designed with these methodological requirements in order to avoid the heterogeneity of data obtained in previous studies. Apart from taking into account patients\u2019 treatment preferences ( ), as   pointed out, a multi-method approach is needed to increase the accuracy in selecting the best psychological treatment. In this regard, knowing which nuclei of the brain are related to fear can be a predominant step to improve the strategies aimed at eliminating its pathological learning ( ). \n\n## Method \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe sample was composed of 24 adults, of whom 12 had cockroach phobia and 12 did not have any phobias. Each of these two groups included eight female participants and four male participants. The mean age of phobic individuals was 40.08 years (  SD   11.96) and that of non-phobic individuals was 24.08 years (  SD   7.73). There was a significant difference between both groups in age (  F  (1)= 15.15;   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.001). All participants were right handed. For phobic individuals, we applied the following inclusion criteria: Being an adult with this type of phobia; the phobia had to be a primary psychological disorder and not be explained by another health condition, including another phobia or panic attack. The remaining inclusion criteria were not receiving any treatment for cockroach phobia, being right handed, having normal vision, and not having any impediment for a magnetic resonance imaging session. Non-phobic participants were recruited in a similar way among the students of the University of La Laguna in Tenerife, Spain. In this case, subjects obtained course credit in exchange for their participation. \n\n\n### Instruments \n  \nIn order to verify the diagnosis of phobia, we used the questions about phobias and panic disorder of the   Composite International Diagnostic Interview   (CIDI), Version 2.1 ( ). The CIDI is a structured interview for major mental disorders according to the CIE-10 criteria (World Health Organization,  ). For the purposes of this study, items/questions related to specific phobia, social phobia, agoraphobia, and panic attack were selected. In addition, to verify whether participants met the inclusion criteria, a semi-structured interview was conducted asking for each specific criterion. Participants diagnosed with specific small animal phobia were included (F40.218;  ). The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and S-R Inventory of Anxiousness were administered as a complementary diagnosis. \n\nThe HAM-A ( ) is a rating scale for clinicians developed to measure the severity of a patient's anxiety. It assesses 14 areas with a 5-point scale. It is a well-established scale ( ) with adequate psychometric properties, especially inter-rater reliability (interclass correlation coefficients ranged from .74 to .96;  ). In phobic participants, a score of 14 or higher was required. \n\nThe S-R Inventory of Anxiousness ( ) is a 14-item inventory that assesses the most usual symptoms (physiological, cognitive, and behavioral) associated with the response to an anxious stimulus with a 5-point Likert scale. The evaluator points out the target phobic stimulus (in our case, cockroaches) prior to the participant's response. This instrument has high internal consistency (.95;  ) and adequate convergent validity ( ). \n\nHand preference was assessed with the   Edinburgh Handedness Inventory   ( ). \n\nThe nuclear magnetic resonance device used was a GE 3.0\u00a0T Signa Excite HD. Given that anxious participants could drop out of the study if they felt distress in the magnetic resonance device, an ASSET method (with 35 images with ang= 50\u00b0, TE= 2.1\u00a0ms, TR\u00a0=\u00a0150\u00a0ms, 32\u00a0\u00d7\u00a032 matrix and 6\u00a0mm slice width) was chosen to reduce time in the machine. Functional images were recorded with Gradient Echo (TR= 2000\u00a0ms, TE= 30\u00a0ms, FA\u00a0=\u00a075\u00b0, FOV\u00a0=\u00a025.6, Dim. Image\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064\u00a0\u00d7\u00a032, Dim. Voxel\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04x4\u00a0mm). \n\n\n### Design \n  \nA two-group experimental design was used ( ): phobic versus non-phobic individuals. Both groups were exposed to two different conditions: phobic stimuli (cockroaches) and neutral stimuli (wooden balls). Given that we used passive stimulation, a block design was used to present the stimuli in the magnetic resonance device. Each participant was randomly presented with 16 blocks of cockroach images and 16 blocks of images of wooden balls. The duration of each block was 20\u00a0seconds. All images had an identical white background. Participants were exposed to phobic and neutral stimuli in a stereoscopic 3D video with VisualStim digital MRI compatible 3D glasses (graphics card: GeForce 8600GT). \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nThe study was conducted from April to July 2016. Phobic participants were recruited through various media (website, press, flyers, radio, TV, and newspapers), asking for persons with small animal phobia to participate in an fMRI research study. It was explained that after participating in the study, subjects would receive an eight-session psychological treatment for cockroach phobia. Once verifying participants met the inclusion criteria (through the interview and questionnaires), participants were asked to undergo the magnetic resonance test. Prior to that, they signed an informed consent protocol. All participants who met an initial diagnosis of specific phobia (according questionnaire scores), was corroborated by the semi-structure interview (only participants with no-removable metallic belongings, such as implants or devices, were excluded due its interference with fMRI analysis). Participant in non-phobic group were assessed with the same instruments in order to determine they did not meet the criteria for phobic disorder. \n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Research and Animal Welfare of the University of La Laguna (ref. CEIBA2012-0033). \n\n\n### fMRI and data analysis \n  \nBrain images were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 12) software. Pre-processing procedures included realigning, co-registering, segmenting (with forward deformation fields), normalizing (structural images with a 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01x1\u00a0mm voxel size and functional images with a 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04x4\u00a0mm voxel size), and smoothing (Gaussian Kernel of 8\u00a0mm, FWHM). Images were rendered and adjusted to the standard brain template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). In addition, the Xjview 8.14 package was used for neuroanatomic identification of active brain structures. \n\nAs regards specific statistical analyses, a whole-brain study with hierarchized random effects was performed as a general linear model. Intra- and intergroup analyses were made by conducting   t  -test comparisons. Because there was a significant difference in age, the age variable was introduced as a vector in those analyses (as a covariate). \n\nAs a conservative strategy, the Family-Wise Error (  p  <.05 FWE corrected) correction was used to assume when brain activation reached statistical significance. However, non-corrected probabilities were admitted when they were congruent with the biological model of phobias (but never higher than .005, uncorrected). With a voxel size of 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0mm, activations equal to or higher than a cluster size of 5 were selected. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn order to test for internal validity, preliminary ANOVAs were performed to compare the differences in anxiety and phobia scores between the phobic group (PhG) and the non-phobic control group (CG). In general anxiety (HAM-A scale), the PhG showed a mean (  M  ) of 18.25, with a standard deviation (  SD  ) of 10.18. The CG had a   M  \u00a0=\u00a00.67, and a   SD  \u00a0=\u00a01.37. The ANOVA yielded an   F  (1)\u00a0=\u00a035.15, which was statistically significant (  p  \u00a0=\u00a0.001). In the phobia score (S-R scale), the PhG had a M\u00a0=\u00a027.5 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a07.88) and the CG had a   M  \u00a0=\u00a07.75 (  SD  \u00a0=\u00a05.88). This difference was also significant [  F  (1)\u00a0=\u00a048.42;   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.001]. These data show that the PhG had higher scores in anxiety and cockroach phobia than the CG. \n\nAfter testing for internal validity, the analyses were divided into two groups: First, we compared the brain activation of both the PhG and CG in the presence of phobic stimuli and neutral stimuli. Second, we compared the responses of the PhG and CG. \n\n### Phobic group \n  \nIn this section we describe the results in brain activation obtained by the PhG when phobic stimulation and neutral stimulation were compared. Data are summarized in  . These results correspond to the situation when phobic stimuli elicited a greater activation than neutral stimuli, because, as expected, participants did not show a greater activation in the presence of neutral stimuli compared to phobic stimuli.   \nDifferences in functional brain activation in phobic participants. A greater activation was recorded in the presence of phobic stimuli, with FWE corrected and uncorrected   p  -value. \n  Table 1     \n\nAs can be observed, differences in brain activation (i.e., phobic stimulation) were found in the thalamus, pulvinar nucleus, and amygdala; all areas were bilaterally activated). Differential activations were also detected in the superior occipital gyrus (bilateral), and inferior (left), left hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus (bilateral). Similar results were found for the cingulate gyrus: the posterior cingulate gyrus showed a bilateral activation but the anterior cingulate (and superior parietal) gyrus only showed activation on the left side. \n\nTwo areas were activated on the right side: the fusiform gyrus and middle temporal gyrus. The insula had bilateral activation. The inferior frontal gyrus had a differential activation depending on the brain side: its pars triangularis and opercularis were activated on the right side. By contrast, the pars orbitalis showed activation in two areas on the right side and in one area on the left side. \n\nFinally,   shows the differences in both left inferior and left precentral circonvolutions, in the posterior part of the right medial frontal gyrus, in the globus pallidum, and in two areas of the left cerebellum. \n\n\n### Non-phobic group \n  \nThe initial results were similar to those of the phobic group but affected fewer brain areas. As shown on  , the thalamus, pulvinar nucleus, and amygdala were bilaterally activated by phobic stimuli. The inferior occipital gyrus (left), hippocampus (but only the right side), hippocampal gyrus (only left), and superior parietal lobule (only right) were also activated. The superior occipital gyrus was activated by phobic stimuli, but only on the right side and not bilaterally, as happened in the PhG; moreover, in the non-phobic group activation on the right side was observed in the inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis and opercularis) and fusiform gyrus. The precuneus was activated in this group but not in the phobic group.   \nDifferences in functional brain activation in non-phobic participants. A greater activation was recorded in the presence of phobic stimuli, with FWE corrected and uncorrected   p  -value. \n  Table 2   \n\n\n### Differences between the phobic and non-phobic groups \n  \nGiven that a significant difference was found in age between both groups, the age variable was introduced as a covariate. No statistically significant results were found regarding the modulating role of age in the following results. For all dependent variables, there were not F value higher than   F  (1,20)\u00a0=\u00a014.82 (coefficient from which age could be considered to play a significant role). \n\nWhen both groups were compared in the phobic stimuli condition (see  ), the PhG showed a significantly higher activation in left side structures such as the thalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, and inferior temporal gyrus. On the right side of the brain, a higher activation was observed in the parahippocampal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis), and middle temporal gyrus. The non-phobic group showed a higher significant activation in the left middle temporal gyrus.   \nDifferences in functional brain activation between the phobic and non-phobic groups under the phobic stimuli condition, with FWE corrected and uncorrected   p  -value. \n  Table 3   \n\nTo illustrate the differential activations found between both groups,   shows standardized brain activations during phobic stimulation for the phobic and non-phobic groups. As can be observed, both groups produced an emotional activity responding to phobic stimuli. But PhG attained higher brain activity (more yellow colour). This higher hemodynamic response can be observed, practically, in all brain slices. Also, it can be observed a more bilaterally activation in phobic individuals.   \nGraphical representation of differential brain activations of phobic group (PhG) versus non-phobic control group (CG). \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study we attempted to answer two questions about brain activation in specific phobia. We intended to explore the differences under phobic stimulation vs. non-phobic stimulation and the differences between phobic and non-phobic individuals under phobic stimulation. In order to obtain a sample with greater homogeneity than that of previous studies, cockroach phobia was selected as the specific phobia. In addition, to increase the realism of stimuli, a 3D video stimuli presentation was used. \n\nWhen we analyzed the brain responses of phobic individuals under phobic vs. neutral stimulation, we found a significant differential activation pattern that was consistent with previous data. The results obtained were congruent with a model of the existence of a two-route functional network in processing feared stimuli ( ,  ,  ). According to this model, the information related to emotional stimuli follows a dual route toward the amygdala: (i) a \u201cshort and non-conscious route\u201d that involves a direct link between the thalamus and the amygdala; and (ii) a \u201clong and conscious route\u201d that involves the thalamus-sensory and association cortex-entorhinal cortex-hippocampus-subiculum-amygdala. Both routes are used by emotional responses to phobic stimuli, with their behavioral, cognitive, physiological, and endocrine components. \n\nIn our study, individuals with phobia exhibited a differential bilateral activation of the thalamus that was greater on the left side and a differential activation of the amygdala (\u201cshort route\u201d). In the \u201clong route\u201d we observed a differential activation of the superior and inferior occipital gyri (also detected by  ).   found that these areas were highly sensitive to emotional visual information. Moreover, the intense activation of the hippocampus (bilaterally) indicates a certain level of perceived threat ( ,  ). The pulvinar portion is associated with the integration of sensory stimulation and attention. Along with the amygdala, the anterior cingulate gyrus is also involved in fear processing (with awareness in the long route and without awareness in the short route) and response modulation ( ). In phobic individuals, the anterior cingulate gyrus is activated on the left side, while the posterior cingulate gyrus is bilaterally activated. These data are consistent with those reported by  , and  . By contrast,   found that the posterior cingulate gyrus was de-activated during differential conditioning. \n\nApart from this   dual route  , the bilateral activation of the globus pallidum (a structure involved in movement regulation, inhibiting cerebellum impulses) has been found in other studies on specific phobias ( ,  ). The bilateral activaction of the parahippocampal gyrus\u2013a memory area particularly associated to the coding and recognition of enviromental stimuli\u2013has been found in the studies reviewed by  . The bilateral activation of the insula is associated with subjective distress in phobic individuals ( ) and conditioned fear ( ). \n\nThe pars orbitalis, triangularis, and opercularis (inferior frontal cortex) exhibited a differential activation in the presence of phobic stimuli. These areas are involved in emotional regulation of phobias, generally according to the information received from the amygdala ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In addition,   found that areas such as the inferior frontal gyrus, parietal lobule, temporal areas, and anterior cingulate gyrus are involved in the inhibition of both cognitive and motor responses. This may suggest that the phobic participants in our study were inhibiting cognitions and escape behaviors in the presence of phobic stimuli. \n\nThe cerebellum is a structure involved in the acquisition and expression of emotional associative learning that is directly related to fear behavior ( ;  ). Our data are consistent with previous studies that found activation of the cerebellum in response to phobic stimulation ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nWhen controls were exposed to phobic stimulation compared to neutral stimulation we also found activation in several similar brain areas, such as the thalamus, amygdala, occipital and parietal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and supraorbital cortex. This result is similar to those reported by  . Yet, there were no differences in the insula and anterior cingulate gyrus. The prefrontal activation pattern was different compared to phobic individuals. There was activation in the pars triangularis and opercularis, but not in the pars orbitalis. \n\nA possible explanation may be that non-phobic individuals were expressing emotional activity, but without the cognitive distress process (assigned to the left insular cortex) or the emotional regulation of the medial and orbital prefrontal cortex. Indeed, these participants did not show anxiety, as shown by their scores on the inventories. Other authors have found similar results, supporting the differences between anxiety (phobic individuals) and distress (non-phobic individuals).   studied individuals with spider phobia and suggested that the insula is related to a defensive response and the amygdala is related to the detection of emotionally relevant stimuli.   also found higher activation of the amygdala to faces with emotional expressions than to phobic stimuli involving small animals. \n\nThese findings are consistent with our results, since seeing cockroaches caused emotional changes in both phobic and non-phobic individuals. Cockroaches as stimuli may be more likely to elicit disgust, aversion, and fear, because they are associated with the transmission of diseases, dirty places, sewers, etc. Yet, the phobic group also showed a defensive behavior, due to the activation of the insula. It would be interesting to test if this same pattern of activation can be found in individuals with specific phobia of small animals less associated with contamination and dirt (e.g., spiders or lizards). \n\nComplementary results are provided by  , who found bilateral activation of the amygdala in response to unpleasant pictures, and joint activation of the amygdala and insula in response to phobic pictures. In our study, although cockroaches are insects that are likely to lead to a response of disgust and distress in non-phobic persons, the defensive response was only shown by phobic individuals. \n\nIn relation to the above, phobic individuals exhibited a higher activation of the right middle temporal gyrus than non-phobic individuals. However, controls showed higher activation of the left middle temporal gyrus. According to  , this is consistent with our results, because activation of the right middle temporal gyrus is more associated with a phobic response, and activation of the left middle temporal gyrus is more associated with a disgust response. \n\nThis study has several limitations. First of all, sample size may affect the reliability of results ( ). This study only used a type of specific phobia (cockroach phobia) with few experimental stimulation conditions. We cannot establish if these results are due to a phobic condition or can also be observed in anxious non-phobic individuals. Moreover, we did not assess participants\u2019 level of disgust as an emotional state different from fear/phobia ( ). Also, due to sample size, gender differences could not been taken into account. \n\nIn conclusion, the data support the existence of a dual route in the processing of phobic stimuli: one route directly related to emotional processing (short/non-conscious), and another route involving several brain areas more related to a cognitive processing of feared stimuli (long/conscious). \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis research was carried out thanks to the financial support\u00a0provided by the Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain (project PSI2013-42912-R). \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: tbl0005\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tSide\tCoordinates\tt value\tp\tCohen's d*\nThalamus\tRight\t22, -28, -2\t6.79\t.001 uncorr.\t2.9\nThalamus\tLeft\t\u221222, -28, -2\t8.93\t<.0001 uncorr.\t3.81\nPulvinar\tRight\t21, -28, 2\t6.15\t<.0001 uncorr.\t2.62\nPulvinar\tLeft\t\u221221, 28, 2\t6.06\t<.0001 uncorr.\t2.07\nAmygdala\tRight\t30, 0, -18\t4.85\t.001 uncorr.\t2.01\nAmygdala\tLeft\t\u221222, 0, -18\t4.72\t.001 uncorr.\t3.15\nSuperior occipital gyrus\tRight\t26, -72, 30\t7.38\t<.0001 FWE corr.\t2.55\nSuperior occipital gyrus\tLeft\t\u221222, -72, 34\t5.99\t<.0001 FWE corr.\t5.19\nInferior occipital gyrus\tLeft\t\u221242, -76, -2\t12.17\t<.0001 FWE corr.\t4.25\nHippocampus\tLeft\t\u221226, -28, -6\t9.97\t<.0001 FWE corr.\t2.01\nParahippocampal gyrus\tRight\t34, -4, 22\t4.71\t.001 uncorr.\t1.54\nParahippocampal gyrus\tLeft\t\u221234, -4, -22\t3.62\t.001 uncorr.\t1.94\nPosterior cingulate gyrus\tRight\t10, -44, 6\t4.55\t.001 uncorr.\t1.55\nPosterior cingulate gyrus\tLeft\t\u221210, -44, 6\t3.63\t.001 uncorr.\t1.45\nAnterior cingulate gyrus\tLeft\t\u22126, 36, 2\t3.4\t.002 uncorr.\t3.48\nSuperior parietal lobule\tLeft\t\u221222, -64, 54\t8.17\t<.0001 FWE corr.\t4.65\nFusiform gyrus\tRight\t42, -56, -18\t10.9\t<.0001 FWE corr.\t3.45\nFusiform gyrus\tRight\t30, -84, 2\t8.08\t<.0001 FWE corr.\t4.61\nMiddle temporal gyrus\tRight\t46, -68, 6\t10.8\t<.0001 FWE corr.\t1.42\nInsula\tRight\t46, 12, -2\t3.34\t.002 uncorr.\t1.8\nInsula\tLeft\t\u221234, 4, 18\t4.22\t.001 uncorr.\t3.4\nInferior frontal gyrus (p. triangularis)\tRight\t54, 20, 22\t7.97\t<.0001 FWE corr.\t3.13\nInferior frontal gyrus (p. orbitalis)\tRight\t46, 32, 2\t7.34\t.002 FWE corr.\t2.75\nInferior frontal gyrus (p. orbitalis)\tRight\t30, 28, -10\t6.46\t.015 FWE corr.\t2.81\nInferior frontal gyrus (p. orbitalis)\tLeft\t\u221226, 32, -2\t6.58\t.015 FWE corr.\t2.64\nInferior frontal g.

Studies report persistent deficits in number processing and aberrant functional activation of the fronto-parietal numerical network in DD. However, the neural development of numerical abilities has been scarcely investigated. The present paper provides a first attempt to investigate behavioral and neural trajectories of numerical abilities longitudinally in typically developing (TD) and DD children. During a study period of 4 years, 28 children (8\u201311 years) were evaluated twice by means of neuropsychological tests and a numerical order fMRI paradigm. Over time, TD children improved in numerical abilities and showed a consistent and well-developed fronto-parietal network. In contrast, DD children revealed persistent deficits in number processing and arithmetic. Brain imaging results of the DD group showed an age-related activation increase in parietal regions (intraparietal sulcus), pointing to a delayed development of number processing areas. Besides, an activation increase in frontal areas was observed over time, indicating the use of compensatory mechanisms. In conclusion, results suggest a continuation in neural development of number representation in DD, whereas the neural network for simple ordinal number estimation seems to be stable or show only subtle changes in TD children over time. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nHow does the \u201cnumerical brain\u201d develop? Numbers are omnipresent in our lives and our innate ability to detect small numerosities enables us to develop complex mathematical skills at a young age (Starkey et al.,  ; Xu and Spelke,  ; Izard et al.,  ). Not surprisingly, individuals with Developmental Dyscalculia (DD) struggle in their everyday life. DD is a learning disability affecting the acquisition of numerical-arithmetical skills in children with normal intelligence and age-appropriate school education (WHO,  ). Many studies have shown that children with DD display various deficits in number processing skills such as magnitude processing or spatial number representation (Landerl et al.,  ; Rousselle and No\u00ebl,  ; Mussolin et al.,  ; Landerl,  ). Those skills are assumed to predict later arithmetical achievement (Halberda et al.,  ; De Smedt et al.,  ; Geary et al.,  ; Tr\u00e4ff,  ) and are therefore essential for the development of numeracy. DD has a high prevalence (3\u20137%) (Gross-Tsur et al.,  ; Wyschkon et al.,  ; Reigosa-Crespo et al.,  ) and a persisting character (Shalev et al.,  ,  ). The fact that difficulties in numeracy result in reduced employment opportunities and high public costs underscores the importance of understanding more about numerical brain development (Parsons and Bynner,  ; Gross,  ). \n\nResearch performed over the last decades demonstrates that from the first day after birth, infants are capable of discriminating quantities (Xu et al.,  ; Izard et al.,  ) and show specialized neuronal correlates for the processing of numerosities early in development (Hyde et al.,  ; Hyde and Spelke,  ). Over development, a spatial representation of quantity and numbers, also known as mental number line (Berch et al.,  ; Dehaene,  ), emerges. With the acquisition of number words and the symbolic number system, the formation of such an internal representation further refines (Siegler and Booth,  ; von Aster and Shalev,  ; Ebersbach et al.,  ; Halberda and Feigenson,  ). Moreover, numerical magnitude processing skills (linearity of the mental number line, performance in quantity comparison tasks) correlate with arithmetical knowledge and predict future mathematical achievement (Booth and Siegler,  ; De Smedt et al.,  ). A recent study further showed that number line estimation is a good predictor of arithmetic ability at an early age, whilst ordinal processing of numerical symbols was revealed to be a strong predictor of older children's arithmetical skills (Lyons et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ). Besides various other deficits in numerical-arithmetical skills, several studies with DD children reported that they are less accurate in placing numbers on a number line (Geary et al.,  ; Landerl,  ). Piazza et al. ( ) showed that DD children performed at a similar level as 5-years-younger typically developing (TD) children in a task measuring number representation. Furthermore, results of a review reveal that weak performance of magnitude processing skills correlates with low mathematical achievement and DD (De Smedt et al.,  ). These results are supported by neuroimaging findings demonstrating that children with DD show aberrant functional activation in number tasks compared to TD peers. Significantly reduced activation is mainly found in domain-specific regions of the parietal lobe, known to be important for magnitude and ordinal processing and supposed to incorporate the mental number line (Kucian et al.,  ,  ; Price et al.,  ; Mussolin et al.,  ; Ashkenazi et al.,  ). For instance, children with DD showed reduced activation in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and superior parietal lobe when solving a number processing task (Kucian et al.,  ). Moreover, when confronted with arithmetical problems, DD children failed to show a task related modulation in parietal areas. However, findings are not consistent and some studies describe increased activation in DD in these areas (Davis et al.,  ; Kaufmann et al.,  ,  ). Rosenberg-Lee et al. ( ), for instance, reported that children with DD show hyper-activation in parietal cortices when solving subtraction problems. Moreover, activation differences are also found in domain-general regions mainly in the frontal brain, attributed to working memory, attention and planning, but also in occipito-temporal areas of the brain (Kucian et al.,  ,  ; Price et al.,  ; Davis et al.,  ; Kaufmann et al.,  ; Rosenberg-Lee et al.,  ). Recent studies further revealed that children with DD show functional hyper-connectivity of the IPS with the bilateral fronto-parietal network (Jolles et al.,  ; Michels et al.,  ). To summarize, these findings describing an aberrant brain activation pattern possibly reflect the typical deficiency in number processing and the greater cognitive resources needed to solve numerical tasks. \n\nA number of cross-sectional studies have been conducted to investigate age dependent neural differences of numerical functions in TD children. Findings suggest that children activate similar regions to adults when solving numerical tasks (Peters and De Smedt,  ). However, children recruit parietal regions to a lesser extent, in particular the IPS, and show increased frontal activation compared to adults (Ansari et al.,  ; Ansari and Dhital,  ; Cantlon et al.,  ; Kucian et al.,  ; Holloway and Ansari,  ). According to these findings, researchers hypothesized that there is a shift from an initially controlled and effortful (frontal activation) to a subsequently more automatic processing of numerical magnitude (parietal activation) (Ansari et al.,  ; Rivera et al.,  ; Kucian et al.,  ; Holloway and Ansari,  ). Conversely, Rosenberg-Lee et al. ( ) reported an increase in parietal, but also prefrontal and visuo-temporal regions over 1 year in children solving arithmetic problems, suggesting a nonlinear trajectory of development. \n\nSeveral behavioral long-term studies investigated the development of typical and atypical number processing (such as dot enumeration, counting, and number comparison), showing that its efficiency is a good predictor for arithmetical achievement (Halberda et al.,  ; Desoete et al.,  ; Geary et al.,  ; Passolunghi and Lanfranchi,  ; Landerl,  ; Reigosa-Crespo et al.,  ; Tr\u00e4ff,  ). Landerl ( ) followed children's numerical abilities over 2 years and found that even if dyscalculic children showed improvements, numerical processing remains persistently deficient. This is also in line with the results of a systematic review about longitudinal studies of mathematical difficulties indicating that students with math difficulty improve in mathematical measures over time but do not catch up to their peers (Nelson and Powell,  ). Further studies revealed that those deficits are already detectable in kindergarten and continue to persist into adolescence (Shalev et al.,  ,  ; Stock et al.,  ; Geary et al.,  ; Mazzocco et al.,  ). \n\nTo date, the current body of research has identified a substantial deficit in numerical processing in children with DD. Studies with TD subjects indicate that there is a functional specialization in the areas devoted to numerical magnitude representation and involved in the development of the mental number line. On the neural level, DD is associated with aberrant activation patterns of the number-specific parietal regions and domain-general areas. Nevertheless, little is known about the neural development of numerical abilities. \n\nHence, the goal of the present study was to investigate the typical and atypical neural development of numerical abilities by means of longitudinal functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and behavioral data. With fMRI we investigated the ordinal aspect of number processing, as differences between DD and TD children have been reported in parietal and domain general regions during a numerical order task (Kucian et al.,  ). In addition, ordinal number processing has been shown to be an important predictor for arithmetic skills as development progresses (Lyons et al.,  ). Together with behavioral measures on the spatial representation of quantity and numbers (number line task) we aimed to provide insight into the development of numerical abilities. \n\nEvidence from studies with TD children and adults revealed a shift from frontal to parietal activation over time. Based on this literature, we expect to find an increase in activation in the number-specific parietal regions and a decrease in the domain-general regions reflecting the growing proficiency in number processing in TD children (Ansari and Dhital,  ; Cantlon et al.,  ; Holloway and Ansari,  ). To our knowledge there are no studies about the neuro-functional development of children with DD, making predictions about the atypical development difficult. However, studies show that children and adults with DD show aberrant activation in the number-specific parietal areas (Molko et al.,  ; Kucian et al.,  ,  ; Kaufmann et al.,  ). Furthermore, longitudinal behavioral findings show that children with DD show persistent deficits in numerical processing (Geary et al.,  ; Landerl,  ; Nelson and Powell,  ). In line with these findings, we hypothesize a persistent deficiency in numerical processing and consistently lower parietal activity in children with DD compared to TD children (Kucian et al.,  ,  ; Price et al.,  ). As we predict persistent aberrant parietal activity, but at the same time improvements in number processing (Landerl,  ; Nelson and Powell,  ), we further expect to find higher frontal activation over time in DD children reflecting the changes in the requirement of the cognitive resources as a result of a delayed development. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Study design and participants \n  \nIn this longitudinal study, a group of children with DD and a group of TD children were evaluated by neuropsychological tests and fMRI (baseline). After 4.2 (SD = 0.46) years, children returned for a second neuropsychological and fMRI assessment (follow-up) (Figure  ). \n  \nStudy design. Overview of the behavioral tests and fMRI task performed at baseline and after 4.2 years at follow-up. ZAREKI-R, Neuropsychological Test Battery for Number Processing and Calculation in Children; BASIS-MATH 4\u20138, Basic Diagnostic in Mathematics for Grades 4\u20138; KFT 4\u201312, Cognitive Abilities Test; WISC, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children; BTT, Block-Tapping-Test; TAP, Testbattery for Attentional Performance; SLRT-II, Salzburg Reading and Orthography Test. \n  \nIn total 35 (23 DD, 12 TD) children between 8 and 11 years were recruited into this study, of which 25 took part in a previous study (Kucian et al.,  ) (Note that while the previous study acquired data both before and after number line training, only the pre-training data from this previous study were included as a baseline measurement for the present study. Therefore, all children included in the present study participated for the first time in a study at our MRI center and performed the same behavioral tests and fMRI paradigm). Inclusion criteria for all children were an IQ > 85 and no history of a neurologic or psychiatric disorder. Additionally, DD children had to perform below the 10th percentile in the total score or three subtests of a standardized numerical test battery (ZAREKI-R) at baseline. TD children required age-appropriate mathematical performance at baseline and follow-up, defined as performing above the 10th percentile in the ZAREKI-R (range of the TD children: PR 46-100) and above the cut-off of 67 points in the BASIS-MATH 4-8 (range of the TD children: 68\u201383) (see also Figure   and Supplementary Material). According to these criteria, six DD children were excluded because they exceeded the cut-off in the numerical test and one TD child because of medication. Therefore, the behavioral data analyses are based on 17 DD and 11 TD children. \n\nFor the fMRI analysis, three data sets at baseline and seven at follow-up were excluded because of task performance < 50% (1 data set), scanner problems (3 data sets) or poor image quality caused by dental braces (6 data sets). Hence, subsequent statistical group comparisons are based on 14 DD and 11 TD fMRI data sets at baseline, and 13 DD and 8 TD fMRI data sets at follow-up. \n\nInformed and written consent was obtained from participants when older than 16 years and all parents. The study was approved by the Ethics committee of Zurich, Switzerland based on guidelines from the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki (WMA,  ). \n\n\n### Behavioral testing \n  \nAll children completed age-appropriated neuropsychological tests at baseline and follow-up (for an overview see Figure  ). \n\n#### Handedness \n  \nHandedness (3 left handed, 8 ambidextrous, 17 right handed) was determined by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield,  ). \n\n\n#### Diagnosis of DD and general numerical abilities \n  \nAt baseline, numerical abilities were assessed using the revised version of the Neuropsychological Test Battery for Number Processing and Calculation in Children (ZAREKI-R) (von Aster et al.,  ). This test battery consists of 12 subtests assessing basic numerical skills as well as calculation (see Supplementary Material for detailed information about the subtests). Based on this test battery children with DD were identified from scores below the 10th percentile in three subtests or in the total test score (test scores are reported in percentile ranks). At the follow-up assessment, the test for Basic Diagnosis in Mathematics Education for Grades 4\u20138 (BASIS-MATH 4\u20138) (Moser Opitz et al.,  ) was used instead, because it is the only German test in existence which can identify numerical deficiencies up to the eighth grade. The BASIS-MATH test battery is composed of three difficulty levels measuring several arithmetical abilities (see also Supplementary Material). The test battery assumes that mastery of basic mathematical concepts is not reached, if the performance falls under a threshold value of 67 points (out of total 83 points, reported test scores are raw values). \n\nIn order to asses children's arithmetic performance at the peer level, the Arithmetic subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) (Tewes et al.,  ) was performed at baseline. In this subtest children had to solve story problems of increasing difficulty within a set time limit (reported test values are IQ scores). At the follow-up measurement, the Quantity Comparison subtest of the Cognitive Abilities Test (KFT 4-12+R) (Heller and Perleth,  ) was performed. In the Quantity Comparison subtest subjects had 10 min time to solve as many quantity comparisons as possible of increasing difficulty (reported test values are T scores). \n\n\n#### Number line task \n  \nThe spatial representation of numbers was measured by means of a paper-and-pencil number line task adopted from Kucian et al. ( ). Children had to estimate the position of 20 Arabic digits on a left to right oriented number line (length 16 cm) with the labeled end points 0 and 100. A single number was presented verbally as well as visually in form of an Arabic digit on a card. Each number had to be marked on consecutive number lines to avoid the possibility of comparisons between items. Two items per decade were chosen in order to evaluate the entire spatial representation between 0 and 100. \n\nAt the follow-up, a computerized and age-adapted version of the number line task was used. Each of the 20 numbers was presented visually on the screen and its position was indicated by mouse-click. The number line was 21.3 cm in length (806 pixel, with a screen resolution 96 dpi) and had labeled end points. For the number range 0\u2013100, two numbers per decade were selected again. Additionally, participants had to solve 20 items in the number range between 0 and 1000. To obtain the items in the range 0\u20131000, the numbers of the number line test 0\u2013100 were multiplied by 10 and a random digit between 0 and 9 was added in the unit position. \n\nIn both test versions accuracy was measured by calculating the percentage distance from the marked to the correct position of the given number (reported test values are raw values). \n\n\n#### Basic arithmetic operations \n  \nChildren solved 40 basic arithmetic problems (20 addition and 20 subtraction) (Kucian et al.,  ). Each problem was presented verbally as well as visually on a card. The child had to provide the solution verbally and the examiner noted it on the evaluation sheet. There was no time limit for this test. The items ranged from 1 to 100 with single digit as well as double digit problems (e.g., 7+15, 36+42). The items were balanced for frequency of digits and bridging ten. The number of correctly solved items was quantified (reported test values are raw scores, maximum value 20). \n\nAt the follow-up, a computerized and age-adapted version of this task was used. Each of the 20 addition and 20 subtraction was presented visually on the screen and solutions were typed on a keyboard. There was no time limit for this test. To prevent ceiling effects, the test was expanded to numbers up to 1000. Items consisted of one-, two- and three-digit numbers (e.g., 811+5, 235+324) and were balanced for frequency of digits and bridging ten/hundred. RT was measured and the number of correctly solved items was quantified (reported test values are raw scores, maximum value 20). \n\n\n#### Intelligence quotient \n  \nIntelligence was measured with the third, respectively fourth edition of the WISC (Tewes et al.,  ; Petermann and Petermann,  ) (WISC-III: Similarities, Block Design, Vocabulary, Picture Arrangement; WISC-IV: Similarities, Block Design, Matrix Reasoning). Table   shows the estimated general IQ (reported test values are IQ scores). \n  \nDemographic characteristics and scores on numerical abilities, intelligence quotient, working memory, attention, and reading. \n  \n ZAREKI-R, Neuropsychological Test Battery for Number Processing and Calculation in Children [PR], BASIS-MATH 4\u20138, Basic Diagnostic in Mathematics for Grades 4\u20138 [raw score]; WISC, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children [IQ score]; KFT 4-12+R, Cognitive Abilities Test [T score]; BTT, Block-Tapping-Test [raw score]; TAP, Testbattery for Attentional Performance [PR]; SLRT-II, Salzburg Reading and Orthography Test [PR]  . \n  \n\n#### Working memory \n  \nVisuo-spatial and verbal working memory was assessed in order to control for memory effects. At baseline and follow-up working memory was measured with the Block-Suppression-Test (Beblo et al.,  ). The task required subjects to reproduce every second block of a previous presented sequence on a board with nine cubes. The sequences had a length of 3\u20139 cubes. Three items per sequence were presented. The longest sequence which was reproduced correctly twice was quantified (reported test values are raw scores, maximum value 9). \n\nAt the follow-up the subtest Digit Span of the WISC-IV (Petermann and Petermann,  ) was additionally performed. In this task subjects had to repeat an auditorily presented sequence of numerals backwards. The sequences had a length of 2 to 8 numerals. The longest sequence which was reproduced correctly was quantified (reported test values are raw scores, maximum value 8). \n\n\n#### Attention \n  \nLevels of attention and inhibition were measured at follow-up by means of the subtests Alertness and Go-Nogo of the computerized Testbattery for Attentional Performance (TAP) (Zimmermann and Fimm,  ). In the Alertness subtest, subjects had to react as quickly as possible when the target stimulus \u201cX\u201d appeared (intrinsic alertness). Half of the trials were preceded by an acoustic cue stimulus (phasic alertness). The test has four runs and a total of 80 target items. For each subject the percentile rank of the median RT was quantified (reported test values are percentile ranks). In the Go-Nogo subtest, subjects had to react as quickly as possible to a target stimulus (\u201cX,\u201d go condition), but inhibit reactions on a second presented stimulus (\u201c+,\u201d nogo condition). The test has a total of 40 items (20 go and 20 nogo items). For each subject the percentile rank of the median RT was quantified (reported test values are percentile ranks). \n\n\n#### Reading \n  \nThe 1-Min-Reading-Task from the Salzburg Reading and Orthography Test (SLRT-II) (Moll and Landerl,  ) assessing word and pseudoword reading fluency was used to estimate the reading performance at follow-up. Two sheets of paper with either 156 words or 156 pseudowords of increasing length and difficulty were presented. Subjects had 1 min per sheet to read as many words as possible. The amount of correctly read items was quantified (reported test values are percentile ranks). Because of lacking test norms in grades 7 and 8, we interpolated the norms from the test manual (grade 6) and from Kronschnabel et al. ( ) (grade 9). \n\n\n\n### fMRI task \n  \nThe fMRI task, adopted from Kucian et al. ( ), was identical between the baseline and follow-up measurements. In the experimental condition, subjects had to make ordinal judgements (numerical order task: \u201cAre the numbers in an ascending/descending order?\u201d). The control condition was a number identification task (\u201cIs the number 2 present?\u201d) (Figure  ). The entire paradigm lasted 10.5 min and consisted of four blocks of the numerical order task alternating with four blocks of the number identification task. Blocks were counter-balanced between subjects. At the beginning of each block an instruction was shown for 2 s, followed by 10 trials of one of the two conditions and a rest period with a fixation cross for 20 s, resulting in a total block length of 59.5 s. Every stimulus was presented for 2 s, followed by a blank screen with an inter-stimulus-interval jittered between 3 and 5 s. \n  \nfMRI task. The paradigm consisted of alternating blocks of the experimental and control condition. In the experimental condition, subjects had to decide if the three presented numbers were in ascending or descending order (numerical order task). For instance, subjects had to press \u201cyes\u201d in the first and last trial shown in the picture and \u201cno\u201d for the second one. In the control condition, subjects had to indicate if the number 2 was present. Every stimulus was presented for 2 s, followed by a screen with a fixation cross ( ) shown for 3\u20135 s. Reprinted from Kucian et al. ( ), copyright (2011) with permission from Elsevier. \n  \nA stimulus consisted of three Arabic digits between \u201c2\u201d and \u201c9\u201d (horizontally aligned) shown simultaneously via a video goggles system (VisuaStimDigital, Resonance Technology Inc., USA). 40 numerical order items were presented, one fourth with ascending (correct), one fourth with descending (correct) and half of them with no specific order (incorrect). The order of the numerals in the ascending condition (e.g., 2 5 7) was reversed to obtain the descending items (e.g., 7 5 2) and mixed up to obtain the items with no specific order (e.g., 5 2 7). In the control condition, 40 number identification items were presented (20 correct and 20 incorrect items). The paradigm was balanced for numerical distance [max(  n  )-min(  n  ): 5, 6, or 7] between the correct and incorrect as well as ascending and descending items, respectively. Children responded by a button press of the dominant hand (index finger for \u201cyes,\u201d middle finger for \u201cno\u201d). The paradigm was programmed on E-Prime (Version 2, Psychology Software Tolls Inc., USA) and answers were recorded by an MRI compatible response box (Lumina Respond Pad, Cedrus Corporation, USA). Reaction times (RT) smaller than 300 ms and misses were not included in the analyses of the paradigm. \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nMRI data were acquired on a 3T General Electric Signa Scanner (GE Medical Systems, USA) using an 8-channel head coil. Whole brain functional images were acquired interleaved with a gradient echo EPI sequence [36 slices, slice thickness (ST) = 3.4 mm, no interslice skip, matrix size (MS) = 64 \u00d7 64, field of view (FOV) = 220 \u00d7 220 mm, in-plane resolution = 3.4 \u00d7 3.4 mm, flip angle (FA) = 45\u00b0, echo time (TE) = 31 ms, repetition time (TR) = 2100 ms]. Additionally, a T1-weighted structural image was obtained with a fast spoiled gradient echo sequence (3D FSPGR, ST = 1 mm, no interslice skip, MS = 256 \u00d7 192, FOV = 240 \u00d7 192 mm, FA = 20\u00b0, TE = 2912 ms, TR = 9972 ms). \n\nParticipants were carefully instructed and supplied with hearing protection before entering the scanner. To minimize head motion, the head was stabilized with padding. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Behavioral data \n  \nBehavioral data was statistically analyzed with SPSS (Version 20). To assess group differences parametric   t  -tests for independent samples or, if data deviated from normal distribution, non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z-test were performed. In the cases were the assumption of homogeneity of variance was violated, we adjusted the degrees of freedom using the Welch-Satterthwaite method. A mixed-model ANOVA with time (baseline/follow-up) as within-subject factor and group (DD/TD) as between-subject factor was conducted to examine developmental effects. Effect sizes are reported as Cohen's d for   t  -tests and partial \u03b7  for the mixed-model ANOVA. As suggested by Cohen ( ) effect sizes are interpreted as small (  d   = 0.2, \u03b7  = 0.01), medium (  d   = 0.5, \u03b7  = 0.06) or large (  d   = 0.8, \u03b7  = 0.14). \n\n\n#### fMRI data \n  \n##### fMRI motion \n  \nFor each subject the motion finger print according to Wilke ( ) was calculated. Total displacement, a vector combining the measures of translation (x, y, and z) and rotation (pitch, roll, and yaw), was used to check if there is a difference in motion between the baseline and the follow-up measurement and TD and DD group, respectively. In more detail, the motion fingerprint provides a total displacement value and a scan-to-scan displacement value for each volume. For each subject the mean total displacement (td) and mean scan-to-scan displacement (sts) over the time series were calculated (values are reported in mm). \n\nGroups did not differ at the baseline in td (DD: 0.34-2.10, Median = 0.66, TD: 0.43\u20132.34, Median = 0.98, Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z = 1.02,   p   = 0.17, two-sided) or sts (DD: 0.06\u20130.41, Median = 0.14, TD: 0.07\u20130.73, Median = 0.13, Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z = 0.48,   p   = 0.83, two-sided). Also at follow-up, we did not find any differences between the groups for td (DD: 0.44\u20131.13, Median = 0.70, TD: 0.31\u20131.28, Median = 0.90, Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z = 0.81,   p   = 0.40, two-sided) and sts (DD: 0.05\u20130.19, Median = 0.06, TD: 0.05\u20130.10, Median = 0.06, Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z = 0.26,   p   = 0.95, two-sided). \n\nBetween the baseline (0.34\u20132.34, Median = 0.91) and follow-up (0.31\u20131.28, Median = 0.75) no difference was found for td (Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test,   z   = \u22121.39,   p   = 0.17, two-sided). However, the sts displacement was significantly higher for the baseline (0.06\u20130.73, Median = 0.13) compared to the follow-up measurement (0.05\u20130.19, Median = 0.06, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test,   z   = \u22123.53,   p   < 0.001, two-sided). Therefore, it is unlikely that motion affects the results of the group comparison, but it might impact the statistical power of the developmental comparison of the present study. \n\n\n##### fMRI preprocessing \n  \nThe data were analyzed by means of Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Trust Centre for NeuroImaging, UK) running under Matlab (Release 2012b, The MathWorks Inc., USA). \n\nThree dummy scans, acquired to stabilize magnetization at the beginning of the scan, were excluded from the analysis. Then the subjects' functional scans were realigned with rigid body transformations using the mean image as a reference scan. Six motion parameters (translation in x, y, and z direction as well as rotation in pitch, roll and yaw) were stored and included later in the analysis to control for motion. The mean functional image was then coregistered to the subjects' T1-weighted anatomical scan. In a next step, the individual anatomical scan was segmented into gray and white matter according to tissue probability maps of a pediatric atlas (NIH Paediatric Database) (Fonov et al.,  ,  ). The parameters from the coregistration and segmentation were applied to the functional scans to normalize images into MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space. Finally, the functional images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm FWHM (full width half maximum). \n\n\n##### fMRI statistics \n  \nThe first level analysis was performed using a mass-univariate approach based on the GLM. The time series from each subject were modeled with an event related design for the experimental and control condition using a canonical HRF (hemodynamic response function). The subjects' motion parameters were entered as additional regressors. Slow signal drifts and serial correlations were accounted for by using a high-pass filter of 180 s and a first level autoregressive model during maximum-likelihood estimation of the GLM parameters. \n\nAt the group level, a full factorial analysis with the factors group and time as well as IQ as a covariate was conducted for the contrast experimental-control condition. For the factor time (repeated measurement), within-subjects correlations were accounted for by estimating the covariance and accordingly adjusting the statistics and degrees of freedom during inference. \n\nStatistical results are shown at   p   < 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster-extent threshold of   k   \u2265 19 voxels (513 mm ) or at   p   < 0.005 and   k   \u2265 22 (594 mm ). According to Slotnick ( ), the spatial autocorrelation of the data was estimated. Then a Monte Carlo simulation was run with 10'000 iterations, using a type I error voxel activation probability of 0.001, and an estimated FWHM as a Gaussian smoothing kernel in order to derive the cluster extent threshold yielding the desired correction for multiple comparisons at a   p   < 0.05 level (Slotnick,  ). \n\nAnatomical localization of the fMRI results was attained through the SPM Anatomy Toolbox (Eickhoff et al.,  ,  ) and is reported in MNI coordinates. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral data \n  \nGroups did not differ in terms of age, gender and handedness (Table  ). \n\n#### Diagnosis of DD and general numerical abilities \n  \nNumerical abilities differed significantly between DD and TD children at baseline [ZAREKI-R   t   = \u221212.12,   p   < 0.001,   d   = \u22124.08] and follow-up [BASIS-MATH 4\u20138   t   = \u22127.80,   p   < 0.001,   d   = \u22123.06; Table  ]. Every child in the DD group scored under the threshold value of 67 points in the BASIS-MATH and therefore still fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for DD at the follow-up. Moreover, the BASIS-MATH data revealed that the DD group differed significantly in all difficulty levels of the test (all   p   < 0.001), showing a substantial deficit in the very basic arithmetical skills at a mean age of 14 years. \n\nNot surprisingly, at both time points DD children also performed significantly worse than the TD group in the tests measuring numerical skills at a peer level [Arithmetic subtest of the WISC-III at baseline:   t   = \u22123.34,   p   = 0.004,   d   = \u22121.68; Quantity Comparison subtest of the KFT 4\u201312+R at follow-up:   t   = \u22126.90,   p   < 0.001,   d   = \u22122.94; Table  ]. \n\n\n#### Number line task \n  \nThe number line task 0\u2013100 differed slightly between baseline and follow-up assessment, which is why the following results must be interpreted carefully (see also Materials and Methods section). A mixed-design ANOVA with time as within-subject factor and group as between-subject factor showed a significant effect of group [  F   = 13.02,   p   = 0.002, \u03b7  = 0.434] for the number line 0\u2013100 (Table  ). Children with DD placed the numbers further away from the correct position compared to the TD group. There was also a significant main effect of time [  F   = 26.42,   p   < 0.001, \u03b7  = 0.609], showing that accuracy increased with development. Finally, the significant interaction time by group indicated that DD children improved more over time than TD children [  F   = 5.44,   p   = 0.032, \u03b7  = 0.243]. The number line test 0\u20131000, performed at the follow-up assessment, also revealed lower performance for the DD than the TD group (Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z   z   = 1.51,   p   = 0.011,   d   = 1.21) (Table  ). Regarding the measured RT at the follow-up assessment, no significant differences could be found in the number line tasks between groups [number line 1\u2013100:   t   = \u22121.15,   p   > 0.05,   d   = \u22120.45; number line 1\u20131000:   t   = \u22120.97,   p   > 0.05,   d   = \u22120.38]. \n  \nBehavioral results for the spatial representation of numbers (number line), basic arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction), and the fMRI paradigm. \n    \n\n#### Basic arithmetic operations \n  \nFor the basic arithmetic operations,   t  -test revealed significant differences between DD and TD children. At baseline and follow-up, TD children solved more addition [baseline:   t   = \u22123.43,   p   = 0.008,   d   = \u22122.33; follow-up:   t   = \u22122.30,   p   = 0.030,   d   = 0.90] and subtraction problems correctly [baseline: Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z   z   = 1.72,   p   = 0.001,   d   = 1.96, follow-up:   t   = \u22123.79,   p   = 0.001,   d   = \u22121.53; Table  ]. The measured RTs at follow-up show that children with DD took longer to solve the addition [  t   = 2.20,   p   = 0.041,   d   = 0.91] and the subtraction problems [  t   = 2.42,   p   = 0.023,   d   = 0.97] compared to their peers (Table  ). \n\n\n#### Intelligence quotient \n  \nAll participants reached normal range of intelligence during both assessments (IQ range baseline: 93\u2013125; follow-up: 92\u2013122). However, groups differed significantly in the estimated general IQ [baseline: WISC-III   t   = \u22124.65,   p   < 0.001,   d   = \u22121.82; follow-up: WISC-IV   t   = \u22124.41,   p   < 0.001,   d   = \u22121.73; Table  ]. Differences in IQ scores between a group of children with learning disabilities and a control group are often reported in the literature (Geary et al.,  ; Willcutt et al.,  ). One reason for this is that IQ-tests are not independent from numerical skills. The IQ was not entered as a covariate in the subsequent behavioral analysis, since IQ is not independent from the effects of interest (Miller and Chapman,  ; Dennis et al.,  ; Field,  ). \n\n\n#### Attention, reading and working memory \n  \nTo match the groups for comorbid attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD) and dyslexia, the TAP and the SLRT-II were performed. Groups did not differ significantly in any measurement of attention or reading performance (Table  ). Regarding working memory, subjects showed at baseline and follow-up comparable results in the verbal and visuo-spatial memory component. The only significant difference was found in visuo-spatial working memory at the follow-up assessment due to lower performance of children with DD compared to TD (Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Z   z   = 1.16,   p   = 0.039,   d   = \u22120.76) (Table  ). \n\n\n#### Behavioral results from fMRI task \n  \nA mixed-design ANOVA with time as within-subject factor and group as between-subject factor was calculated. For accuracy, the ANOVA revealed a significant effect of time [  F   = 40.85,   p   < 0.001, \u03b7  = 0.63], showing that children were better able to solve the task with increasing age (Table  ). Furthermore, the DD group performed significantly worse than the TD group [  F   = 4.30,   p   = 0.049, \u03b7  = 0.152]. This significant difference arises from their lower performance in the number order task [  F   = 4.54,   p   = 0.044, \u03b7  = 0.159], as performance in the control task was comparable between groups [  F   = 1.66,   p   = 0.209, \u03b7  = 0.065]. The group by time interaction was not significant [  F   = 1.95,   p   = 0.176, \u03b7  = 0.075]. For RT, no effects of group [  F   = 1.91,   p   > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.074] or interaction between time and group [  F   = 0.43,   p   > 0.05, \u03b7  = 0.018] was evident. However, children solved the task faster at the second assessment point [  F   = 50.45,   p   < 0.001, \u03b7  = 0.678; Table  ]. \n\n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \nAnalysis of the task (experimental minus control condition) revealed bilateral parietal activation in TD children at baseline and follow-up. DD children showed at baseline only right lateralized activation in parietal regions (Figure  , Tables  ,  ). \n  \nActivation at baseline and follow-up. Task related brain activation shown on a pediatric template (Fonov et al.,  ,  ) for the contrast numerical order vs. control task at baseline   (Left)   and follow-up   (Right)   for children with developmental dyscalculia (DD)   (Upper)   and typically developing (TD) children   (Lower)   (  p   < 0.01,   k   \u2265 24, cluster-extent corrected). \n    \nBrain areas that showed significant activation for the numerical order vs. control task from dyscalculic and typically developing children at the baseline assessment (  p   < 0.01,   k   \u2265 24, cluster-extend corrected). \n    \nBrain areas that showed significant activation for the numerical order vs. control task from dyscalculic and typically developing children at the follow-up assessment (  p   < 0.01,   k   \u2265 24, cluster-extend corrected). \n  \n#### fMRI group differences \n  \nAt baseline, no significant difference between groups was found at the statistical threshold of   p   < 0.001. \n\nAt follow-up, two-sample   t  -tests revealed significant differences between children with DD and controls (Figure  , Table  ). Children with DD showed increased activation in frontal areas including bilateral middle frontal gyri (MFG) and the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). In the parietal lobe, more activation in the bilateral angular gyri (AG), extending into the supramarginal gyri (SMG) and the left IPS was found. TD children did not show any increased activation compared to children with DD at follow-up (  p   < 0.001). \n  \n (A)   Group differences at follow-up. Increased activation in the dyscalculic compared to the typically developing group at the follow-up assessment (  post-hoc t  -test for the contrast DD vs. TD,   p   < 0.001,   k   \u2265 19, cluster-extent corrected).   (B)   Developmental increase in DD. Increase in brain activation in the dyscalculic group over developmental time (  post-hoc t  -test for the contrast follow-up vs. baseline,   p   < 0.005,   k   \u2265 22, cluster-extent corrected).   (C)   Negative interaction. Activation increase over time was more pronounced in children with dyscalculia compared to typically developing children (group by time interaction,   p   < 0.005,   k   \u2265 22, cluster-extent corrected). \n    \nBrain areas that showed significant activation for the contrast dyscalculic vs. typically developing children at the follow-up assessment (  p   < 0.001,   k   \u2265 19, cluster-extend corrected). \n  \n\n#### fMRI developmental effects \n  \nDevelopmental changes took place in the DD group, showing increased activation in the basal forebrain and the left insula at   p   < 0.001. At a threshold of   p   < 0.005, additional activation increases in the bilateral IPS, right insula, left IFG, left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and left thalamus were observed (Figure  , Table  ). No decrease in activation was found in the DD group over development. \n  \nBrain areas that showed significant developmental changes in children with developmental dyscalculia and the negative interaction group by time (  p   < 0.005,   k   \u2265 22, cluster-extend corrected). \n  \nTD children did not show any increase or decrease in activation over development at the statistical threshold of   p   < 0.005. \n\nThe negative interaction time by group indicated that the activation increase over time was more pronounced in children with DD than in TD children. The left IFG was the only region showing interaction effects at the higher cluster-extent threshold (  p   < 0.001). A lower threshold (  p   < 0.005) revealed activation in similar regions to the   t  -test in DD over development, namely in the left middle cingulum extending into somatosensory area, left IPS, left hippocampus, and right AG (Figure  , Table  ). \n\nIn order to investigate the developmental effects further, a regression analysis was performed with 14 fMRI data sets, comprised of both baseline and follow-up scans. Each subjects' activation increase over time, for the contrast experimental minus control condition (interaction time point x condition), and the number of the correctly solved basic arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction) at baseline were included in the analysis. Results revealed a negative correlation between the activation increase over time and the number of correctly solved subtractions and additions at the baseline assessment (cluster-extent corrected   p   < 0.001). This indicates that children who solved fewer arithmetic problems correctly at baseline showed more activation increase over time in bilateral cingulate cortex extending into right frontal gyri and left supplementary motor area (SMA), bilateral insular lobe extending bilaterally into putamen and caudate nucleus, left inferior (IFG) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and right cerebellum. In the parietal lobe, broad activation increases were found in bilateral angular gyri (AG) extending into inferior parietal lobe and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and bilateral precuneus (see Figure  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present longitudinal study, we investigated the neuro-functional development of children with and without DD by means of neuropsychological tests and fMRI. In line with previous studies, we found that children with DD improved over time, but nonetheless showed persistent deficits in number processing and arithmetical skills when compared to their peers. \n\nBrain imaging results revealed an increase in frontal and parietal brain activation over time in children with DD. In contrast, results of TD children point to a stable activation pattern over development. Furthermore, a lower performance in basic arithmetic operations correlates with a more pronounced increase in the fronto-parietal network over time. \n\n### Deficient numerical processing and aberrant neural networks \n  \nAs hypothesized, we found considerable deficits in number processing and arithmetic abilities in children with DD compared to a peer group. The more pronounced inaccuracy in a number line task is typically found in dyscalculics and is consistent with a large body of research findings (Geary et al.,  ,  ; Landerl,  ). In addition, the accuracy in a number line task is thought to reflect a better representation of quantity (Siegler and Booth,  ; Ebersbach et al.,  ). Therefore, our data point to a deficient mental number line representation in 9 and 14-year old dyscalculic children. Consistent with the study from Piazza et al. ( ), the children with DD performed at the same level as the control group when 4-years younger. Given that numerical magnitude representation further influences arithmetical learning, it is in good agreement with earlier studies (Booth and Siegler,  ) that our DD group also showed poor performance in basic addition and subtraction problems. \n\nRegarding brain activation, group differences were evident at the follow-up assessment. Children with DD showed increased activation in frontal (MFG, IFG) and parietal (AG, left IPS) regions of the numerical network compared to their peers. This is in contradiction with studies reporting reduced activation in the parietal key regions for numeracy. However, our findings are in line with several studies, who found increased activation in fronto-parietal regions of DD children (Kaufmann et al.,  ; Kucian et al.,  ; Iuculano et al.,  ; Rosenberg-Lee et al.,  ). Similar results were further reported in the meta-analysis by Kaufmann et al. ( ). The authors suggested, that the increased IPS and postcentral activation reflects the recruitment of finger-based number representation in DD children, which might also be the case in our study. \n\nAt baseline, we did not find any differences in the activation pattern of the groups. A reason for this is that we chose a rather strict significance level to report our results. When lowering the statistical threshold activation differences in occipito-parietal, temporal and frontal regions could be detected, which are in line with those reported in the literature (e.g., Kaufmann et al.,  ; Kucian et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Typical and atypical development \n  \nConsistent with our expectations, TD children showed a growing proficiency in number processing with development, as seen in a significant improvement in the number line task. DD children also did not stagnate in their development, exhibiting a decrease in error rates when placing numbers on a number line. In fact, our results showed that the dyscalculic's number line performance improved more over time than that of the TD children. This result is consistent with other findings of long-term studies (Geary et al.,  ; Landerl,  ). However, even when the gap between the typical and atypical development in the mental number line decreases, children with DD always performed significantly lower than their peers. Our results confirm findings from earlier studies (Shalev et al.,  ,  ) and the result from a systematic review (Nelson and Powell,  ) showing that number representation in DD is deficient and delayed in development. In addition, children with DD still showed substantial deficits in simple arithmetic through the entire study. This result supports the importance of effective and efficient ordinal and magnitude number processing abilities in the development of arithmetical skills (Booth and Siegler,  ). \n\nThe brain activation patterns of TD children revealed no significant difference over the examined time. This result seems surprising, considering findings from earlier studies, who showed an age related activation increase in the IPS and a decrease in frontal areas during magnitude processing (Ansari et al.,  ; Ansari and Dhital,  ). However, it is important to note that most of the studies compare numeracy-established adults with developing children and therefore assume linearity in development. It might be that some of the mentioned changes occur only at specific periods in development. Moreover, the brain activation pattern from our results is in line with results from a study using the same task (Kucian et al.,  ). Our findings are further consistent with Kucian et al. ( ), revealing no differences comparing children over a 3-year period, but finding changes between children and adults. Along with the increasing proficiency on the behavioral level, our results speak for a consistent and well working number processing network in TD children. Importantly, the present results do not exclude the possibility that the number processing network continuously develops and refines in typical development over time. Furthermore, these results must be interpreted cautiously and confirmed with bigger group sizes. \n\nInterestingly, children with DD showed a remarkable activation increase in the entire fronto-parietal network over the observed period of development. The growth of activation in the basal forebrain, bilateral insula and bilateral IFG is in good agreement with the literature, indicating that these regions play a crucial role in working memory, attention, and cognitive control. Together with the better performance in the fMRI task, this finding supports the notion that children with DD constantly use domain-general regions to a larger extent, reflecting the higher cognitive demands induced by the task. Besides, children with DD showed an activation increase in the bilateral IPS over developmental time. It is further worth pointing out, that in children with DD the activation increase in the left IPS was much greater than in the right IPS, whilst TD peers showed stable bilateral IPS activation over time. Findings show that activation changes with growing proficiency in (symbolic) number representation in the left IPS and is stable over development in the right IPS (Vogel et al.,  ). In context with the improvement in the fMRI paradigm and the catch-up in the number line task, our results lend support to a stronger use of number-specific areas in children with DD. This is in line with the results of the regression analysis, indicating that children who solved fewer arithmetic problems correctly at baseline showed more activation increase over time. Furthermore, the negative interaction also revealed activation in parietal number-specific regions and frontal domain-general regions, indicating that the developmental changes were more pronounced in children with DD. This mirrors the results from our behavioral data and previous studies, showing that the gap between TD and DD performance diminishes over development (Geary et al.,  ; Landerl,  ). \n\nTo our knowledge, no neuro-imaging long-term studies exist in the field of dyscalculia, but results from studies with dyslexic children also showed differences in the development of the neural reading system. Comparable to our findings, age related increases are seen in domain-specific occipito-temporal regions but also in domain-general regions (left IFG) (Shaywitz et al.,  ). Furthermore, Rosenberg-Lee et al. ( ) looked at brain maturation processes between 2nd and 3rd grades during arithmetic problem solving. In line with our results, better behavioral performance and a significant increase in activity were observed in the right superior parietal lobe, IPS and AG, PHG, and frontal regions from grade 2 to 3. Based on these activation increases, which have been associated with initial stages of learning, the developmental effects in our DD group might also reflect neural maturation processes. \n\nTo summarize, our results support the notion that TD children have a well-functioning number processing network, and therefore showed only subtle developmental effects over the examined time. Dyscalculic children, however, showed age-related changes in frontal areas of the brain. These can be related to compensatory mechanisms or different but less effective task solving strategies, which are often observed in children with DD. Secondly, the increase in domain-specific parietal areas, hints to maturation or delayed development of number processing areas. Although these findings are promising, it is important to note that children with DD did not fully catch up to their peer group in numerical-arithmetical skills and showed less focused activation patterns, underscoring that the deficiencies do not fully vanish with time. \n\n\n### Methodological considerations \n  \nTo our knowledge this is the first longitudinal study looking at neural development in children with and without DD. The lack of other longitudinal studies in DD might arise from several reasons. Firstly, longitudinal fMRI studies in children are especially prone to high drop-out due to more movement artifacts and braces. This was also the case in our study and the reason why we have unequal and small sample sizes. For this reason, our results (in particular the results from the TD children) should be interpreted with caution. However, the same main results were obtained when evaluating the study with equal group sizes revealing that our results are stable and not based on differences in group size (see Supplementary Material and Figures  \u2013 ). Furthermore, in order to check the statistical power of our findings, we conducted   post-hoc   power analyses (G Power; Faul et al.,  ) for the significant main results of the behavioral data with \u03b1 = 0.05, and the effect and sample sizes as reported for the specific statistical test (see Results section, Tables  ,  ). For most of the tests we reached good statistical power (1\u2212\u03b2 \u2265 0.80). However, for the interaction of the number line test 1\u2013100 and the effect of group in the accuracy of the fMRI paradigm we detected a power of 0.60 and 0.51, respectively. Thus, the likelihood that these results reflect true effects is reduced. In addition, power analyses for the main effects of the fMRI data were conducted by means of the software package fMRIpower (Mumford and Nichols,  ). This method estimates power for detecting significant activation within specific regions of interest, with the assumption that the planned studies will have the same number of runs per subject, runs of the same length, similar scanner noise characteristics, and data analysis with a comparable model (Mumford and Nichols,  ). For this purpose, post-training data from Kucian et al. ( ) (which were acquired with the same fMRI paradigm on the same MR-Scanner, but were not included in the present longitudinal study, see also Materials and Methods section) were used as \u201cpilot data\u201d for the power analysis. The power analyses were carried out for each of the regions of the automated anatomical labeling (aai) roi mask with \u03b1 = 0.05 and the sample sizes as reported for the specific contrast of the present study. For the   group differences at the follow-up assessment   (Figure  , Table  ), power estimates between 11 and 62% were obtained for the brain areas that showed significant activation, with the highest power estimate of 62% observed in the left IPS and angular gyrus. Similarly, the brain areas that showed significant   developmental changes in children with DD   (Figure  , Table  ), reached power estimates between 18 and 79%. The highest values of 70 and 79% of power were detected for the left and the right IPS, respectively, whilst lower power estimates were reached for the frontal areas of the brain. Despite the fact that more subjects would be necessary to increase the power of the present study, the results of the conducted power analyses reveal that the power estimates for the numerical key areas are already near to the desired power of 80% and therefore likely show true effects. \n\nSecondly, the choice of the fMRI paradigm, especially in longitudinal studies, is constrained by the requirements that it must be feasible for children with DD (performance over chance level) and not too easy for TD children (ceiling effects). An adaptation of the difficulty level of the task results in a loss of comparability over time, which we wanted to avoid. As a consequence, ceiling effects might have led to a loss of behavioral group differences at the follow-up. \n\nThirdly, longitudinal study designs are very time consuming regarding (re-)recruitment and maintenance of the participant's motivation. Thus, developmental questions are in many cases examined by more time-efficient methods such as cross-sectional designs. Importantly, cross-sectional designs do not take into account inter-individual differences to the same extent as longitudinal designs. Furthermore, most cross sectional-studies compare adults and children and might therefore miss an opportunity to capture the full developmental trajectory. We think that our results are promising and provide an important contribution to the understanding of the typical and atypical development of number processing, but further work is needed to verify our findings and strengthen the understanding of developmental trajectories. \n\nDespite these methodological considerations, our findings suggest a continuation in the neural development of number representation in children with DD, whereas the neural network for simple ordinal number estimation seems to be stable or show only subtle changes over time in TD children. Furthermore, our results shed light on the behavioral and neural trajectories in dyscalculia and emphasize the importance of longitudinal studies for the understanding of development. This knowledge contributes to the understanding of numeracy and might therefore be meaningful for education and implementation of therapy and support of children with difficulties in mathematics. \n\n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nAll authors have contributed and have approved the final manuscript.

Critically, the amygdala is thought to be one of the central brain regions mediating PTSD symptoms. In the current study, we compare directly patterns of amygdala complex connectivity using fMRI, before and after EEG neurofeedback, in order to observe subcortical mechanisms associated with behavioural and alpha oscillatory changes among patients. \n\n\n## Method \n  \nWe examined basolateral (BLA), centromedial (CMA), and superficial (SFA) amygdala complex resting-state functional connectivity using a seed-based approach via SPM Anatomy Toolbox. Amygdala complex connectivity was measured in twenty-one individuals with PTSD, before and after a 30-minute session of EEG neurofeedback targeting alpha desynchronization. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nEEG neurofeedback was associated with a shift in amygdala complex connectivity from areas implicated in defensive, emotional, and fear processing/memory retrieval (left BLA and left SFA to the periaqueductal gray, and left SFA to the left hippocampus) to prefrontal areas implicated in emotion regulation/modulation (right CMA to the medial prefrontal cortex). This shift in amygdala complex connectivity was associated with reduced arousal, greater resting alpha synchronization, and was negatively correlated to PTSD symptom severity. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThese findings have significant implications for developing targeted non-invasive treatment interventions for PTSD patients that utilize alpha oscillatory neurofeedback, showing evidence of neuronal reconfiguration between areas highly implicated in the disorder, in addition to acute symptom alleviation. \n\n   Highlights  \n  \nAlpha desynchronizing neurofeedback was associated with a shift in amygdala complex connectivity. \n  \nConnectivity shifted from areas implicated in defensive fear processing/memory retrieval, to prefrontal emotion regulation areas. \n  \nShift in amygdala complex connectivity was associated with reduced arousal and PTSD symptom severity, and greater resting alpha synchronization after neurofeedback. \n  \nThese findings have significant implications for developing targeted non-invasive treatment interventions for PTSD patients. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \nIndividuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experience frequent hyperarousal, emotional numbing, and vivid re-experiencing of traumatic memories, in addition to cognitive and behavioural avoidance ( ). Here, the manifestation of PTSD symptomatology has been shown to be mediated in part through altered neurocircuitry of the amygdala ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Central neurophysiological characteristics of the disorder include: aberrant amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation during symptom provocation ( ,  ,  ), fear processing ( ,  ,  ) and rest ( ,  ,  ), in addition to altered amygdala connectivity at rest to the insula ( ,  ), hippocampus, cingulate cortex ( ) and medial PFC ( ,  ). Critically, PTSD symptoms of hyperarousal have been associated with negative medial PFC-amygdala coupling ( ), and hyper/hypo-activation of the amygdala and medial PFC, respectively, during PTSD emotional processing ( ). This may represent attenuated top-down inhibition from the PFC, on the amygdala, in PTSD patients ( ,  ,  ). The amygdala also displays connectivity to lower order brain regions ( ) such as the periaqueductal gray (PAG), in order to orchestrate defense, and fear related processing ( ), which are heavily implicated in PTSD ( ,  ) and may be activated recurrently after trauma in a suboptimal way ( ). \n\nInterestingly, unique amygdala connectivity patterns among patients with PTSD have been reported as a result of examining amygdalar complexes separately ( ,  ). Briefly, the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) appears to be involved in the cortical integration of emotional processing and fear-related learning, and is regulated by inhibition from the PFC ( ). In contrast, the centromedial amygdala complex (CMA) is reported to be involved in the behavioural execution of fear responses, containing projections to the PAG and brainstem ( ,  ,  ), and the superficial amygdala complex (SFA) is further involved in affective, social, and olfactory processing ( ,  ,  ). In addition, the left amygdala has been shown to be associated with the detailed/elaborate processing of emotional stimuli, while inversely, the right amygdala engages in the rapid/automatic detection of emotional stimuli ( ,  ). In sum, as the amygdala displays a central role in the pathophysiology of PTSD ( ,  ,  ), characterized by unique functional connectivity patterns among amygdalar complexes ( ,  ), normalization of amygdala complex activity/connectivity in PTSD patients could significantly attenuate symptoms in this patient population. \n\nWith regard to therapeutically altering PTSD brain connectivity and downstream effects on behaviour, electroencephalogram (EEG) neurofeedback has been used as a non-invasive approach to plastically modulate large-scale neural networks \u2013 such as the salience network, default mode network (DMN), and executive functioning network ( ,  ) \u2013 which have been shown to be implicated in PTSD ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Recent reports suggest covariation between alpha oscillations and spontaneous changes in the aforementioned neural networks associated with PTSD ( ,  ). Alpha oscillations (8\u201312\u00a0Hz) reflect a state of resting wakefulness, negatively correlated to tasks requiring concentration ( ), and positively correlated to the \u201ctask-negative\u201d DMN ( ,  ) \u2013 which is of particular note given that the DMN and self-referential processing are known to be altered in patients with PTSD ( ). Among PTSD patients, alpha desynchronizing neurofeedback was found to induce a homeostatic \u201crebound\u201d in alpha synchronization post-training that was associated with reductions in hyperarousal ( ). Elsewhere, PTSD patients have been shown to be characterized by decreased alpha oscillations ( ,  ). \n\nThe rationale for the current study manifests from the potential triangular relationship between the following phenomena: i) aberrant amygdala complex connectivity has been shown to be a central neural characteristic mediating PTSD psychopathology ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), ii) EEG alpha desynchronization has previously been shown to plastically alter the neural networks implicated in PTSD ( ), and iii) the latter has led to symptom alleviation among patients with PTSD ( ). Hence, using the same dataset as ( ) in which neural networks were successfully altered in patients with PTSD, we conducted a follow-up study investigating amygdala complex connectivity before and after one 30-minute session of alpha desynchronizing neurofeedback, in order to observe subcortical mechanisms associated with behavioural and alpha oscillatory changes among patients. Firstly, we predicted increased amygdala complex connectivity to mid-brain/brainstem areas implicated in the defense cascade (such as the PAG), before neurofeedback. Secondly, we predicted that neurofeedback would shift amygdala complex connectivity towards enhanced coupling with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and emotion regulation regions ( ), where we hypothesize this to be a modulating mechanism underlying reduced arousal after neurofeedback. \n\n## Method \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe sample consisted of 21 participants who met DSM-IV criteria ( ) for a primary diagnosis of PTSD (see   for demographic and psychometric information), where all patients experienced childhood sexual and/or physical abuse. As previously described by  , Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders ( ), and the Clinician-Administered PTSD scale (CAPS; cut-off score\u00a0>\u00a050;  ), were employed by a trained psychologist to obtain Axis I diagnoses; in addition, all participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ;  ) and the Multiscale Dissociation Inventory (MDI;  ). Exclusion criteria for patients with PTSD included: diagnosis of psychotic disorders over their lifetime, bipolar disorder, substance use disorders within the last 6\u00a0months, previous head trauma, significant untreated medical or neurological illness, and noncompliance with 3T fMRI safety standards. At the time of study, eleven participants were taking psychotropic medications, consisting of: citalopram (  n  \u00a0=\u00a02), fluoxetine (  n  \u00a0=\u00a01), sertraline (  n  \u00a0=\u00a01), clonazepam (  n  \u00a0=\u00a03), trazodone (  n  \u00a0=\u00a01), clozapine (  n  \u00a0=\u00a01), quetiapine (  n  \u00a0=\u00a01), cipralex (  n  \u00a0=\u00a03), and mirtazapine (  n  \u00a0=\u00a01). \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nApproval for the current study was obtained by Western University's ethic board, where all participants provided written informed consent. Experimental procedures were described in detail by   and consisted of the following, which occurred sequentially on the same visit: a resting state fMRI scan before neurofeedback, an EEG neurofeedback session, and a second fMRI scan after neurofeedback. The time between the first and second fMRI scan was about 1\u00a0h, where participants went back into the fMRI scanner on average about 20\u00a0min after neurofeedback. Immediately before and after the EEG neurofeedback session, participants were administered the Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory (STAI;  ) and the Thayer's Activation/Deactivation Adjective Checklist ( ) in order to examine state anxiety and arousal levels, respectively. Additionally, following neurofeedback training, we asked participants if they felt as though they had control over the signal feedback they were receiving, how the experience made them feel, and what strategy they found to be successful. Our proof-of-concept study with healthy controls showed that successful alpha desynchronization via EEG neurofeedback significantly alters network connectivity as compared to a sham feedback ( ). Importantly, there is also evidence to suggest that effective learning of voluntary control of brain rhythms may be compromised after receiving false neurofeedback ( ), and therefore a sham-feedback region was not included. Moreover, neurofeedback represents a task which i) mitigates visual stimuli dependent factors in experimental designs leading to greater intrinsic effects, ii) produces the same reward contingencies across participants, and iii) has variability in terms of success between participants ( ,  ). Hence neurofeedback represents an elegant way to \u201cclamp the external milieu\u201d, in order to delineate causal, intrinsic relationships ( ). \n\n\n### EEG neurofeedback: paradigm, recording, and preprocessing \n  \nWe followed the same EEG neurofeedback experimental design, in addition to recording and preprocessing procedures, as previously reported by  . The EEG session consisted of a 3-minute baseline measure both before and after a 30-minute neurofeedback training session. During baseline recordings, in which participants did not receive neurofeedback, participants were instructed to relax with their eyes open and gaze at a blank wall (limiting eye movements). The 30-minute neurofeedback session consisted of participants attempting/learning to suppress real-time alpha amplitudes (8\u201312\u00a0Hz) recorded from the midline parietal cortex (electrode Pz). Here signal feedback was derived from Pz, as global alpha signal averaged across multiple electrodes, may lead to a mixing of local cortical dynamics ( ). This electrode was chosen based on its location over the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus, which are major hubs of the DMN whose blood oxygen level dependent signal changes have been correlated to EEG alpha rhythm modulations ( ,  ). The neurofeedback paradigm (implemented through EEGer 4.2 neurofeedback software and the \u2018SpaceRace\u2019 game) consisted of continuous real-time visual feedback in the form of a moving spaceship, and a dynamic bar whose height was inversely proportional to instantaneous alpha amplitude. Participants were instructed that the spaceship would only move forward when they were in the zone of target brain activity (alpha lower than threshold), and that the spaceship would stop when they were outside the zone of target brain activity (alpha higher than threshold). In order to prevent demand characteristics from affecting training, we did not give participants specific instructions for regulatory strategies, nor were they informed about the type of EEG parameter/frequency that was being targeted. \n\n\n### EEG spectral analysis \n  \nWe calculated EEG spectral amplitudes offline via short-time Fourier transformations in 4-s epochs (50% overlapping with Hanning window) in the alpha frequency band (8\u201312\u00a0Hz). In order to investigate whether patients were able to successfully lower their absolute alpha amplitude during neurofeedback, as compared to the first baseline, we conducted a Bonferroni corrected paired   t  -test for average absolute alpha amplitudes during the initial baseline and during the entire neurofeedback training session. We additionally conducted a Bonferroni corrected paired   t  -test comparing baseline absolute average alpha amplitudes pre and post neurofeedback training, in order to investigate if patients has plastically changed their absolute alpha amplitudes. In order to observe percent signal change, we normalized alpha values for each participant, for the following ratios of interest: a) \u201ctraining alpha change\u201d normalized by taking the ratio of average alpha amplitude during neurofeedback as compared to the average alpha amplitude during the first baseline, b) \u201cresting alpha change\u201d normalized using the ratio of the average alpha amplitude during the second baseline as compared to the first baseline. Hence, with changes in alpha amplitude normalized, ratios >\u00a00 denote a relative % increase in alpha amplitude, and inversely, values <\u00a00 demarcate a relative % decrease. In order to observe relationships between training alpha change, resting alpha change, and absolute alpha amplitude during the initial baseline, we computed a Pearson product moment correlation between the two change scores and the score for the initial baseline in SPSS (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). This was conducted for global changes of alpha amplitude (averaged across the 19 electrodes), in addition to local changes as measured by Pz, in order to quantitatively compare local vs. global measures of alpha. \n\n\n### fMRI acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nResting-state fMRI acquisition parameters are described in detail by  . Image preprocessing and statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8 and SPM12, Wellcome Department of Neurology, London, UK:  ) within Matlab 8.3 (Mathworks Inc., MA.). Images were subjected to slice-time correction (with reference to the middle slice), realignment and further motion correction using ART software (Gabrieli Lab. McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Cambridge, MA) which computes motion outlier regressors to be used in the 1st level analysis as a covariate of no interest. Images were then coregistered to the participant's corresponding T1 anatomical image, and subsequently segmented, normalized, and smoothed with an 8\u00a0mm full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. Band-pass filtering was conducted using successive application of a high-pass and low-pass filter (frequency cut-offs 0.012\u00a0Hz and 0.1\u00a0Hz respectively) using in-house software by co-author Jean Th\u00e9berge. Amygdala complex seed masks were created using SPM's Anatomy Toolbox ( ) featuring cytoarchitectonically-based probability maps of the amygdala. Connectivity correlations were standardized using a Fisher r-to-Z transformation in SPM. \n\n\n### fMRI connectivity analysis \n  \nFor each participant, a mean signal intensity time course was extracted from SPM's Anatomy Toolbox for each of the six seed regions (bilateral BLA, CMA and SFA), to be used as a regressor in a correlation analysis delineating functional connectivity. This was done separately for pre and post neurofeedback resting state scans. Both positive correlations and negative correlations were examined. An initial whole-brain 2 (neurofeedback)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 (whole amygdala hemisphere) repeated measures full-factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted in the second level, in order to first observe any plastic changes in amygdala functional connectivity as a result of neurofeedback, justifying subsequent examination of amygdala complexes separately. The neurofeedback factor consisted of 2 levels: pre and post neurofeedback, and the amygdala factor consisted of 2 levels: left and right whole amygdala seeds, averaging mean signal intensity time courses from all amygdala complexes in each corresponding hemisphere (BLA, CMA and SFA) extracted using SPM's Anatomy Toolbox. The levels within the neurofeedback factor and amygdala hemisphere factor were set to dependent in order to account for repeated measures. To investigate changes in amygdala complex connectivity as a function of alpha desynchronization, we examined the neurofeedback\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0whole amygdala hemisphere interaction, which yielded 4 significant (FWE-corrected   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05,   k  \u00a0=\u00a010) gray matter clusters (see   for ANOVA results), including the cerebellar culmen, lentiform nucleus of the putamen/hippocampus, dorsal PAG, and the PCC. Follow-up comparisons of the peak coordinates (limited to 6\u00a0mm spheres centered around coordinate) meeting the above error rate protection were then conducted using one-sample   t  -tests; in addition, paired   t  -tests were also conducted in order to examine differences in amygdala complex connectivity to these regions as a result of neurofeedback. Follow-up analyses utilized p-uncorrected\u00a0<\u00a00.005 and k\u00a0=\u00a010, in accordance with the suggestion of   to balance the relative risk of Type I versus II error rates, and to protect against circularity/inflating significance values via using our own data to correct post-hoc analyses ( ,  ,  ). The cerebral aqueduct was exclusively masked using PickAtlas, in order to control for CSF signal. Similarly, the mPFC was specified a-priori and used to conduct a region-of-interest analysis, utilizing the same error protection rate as the ANOVA (FWE-corrected   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05\u00a0  k  \u00a0=\u00a010) for the aforementioned one-sample and paired-sample t-tests with a 6-mm radius sphere (MNI\u00a0=\u00a01 60\u20131;  ). Additionally, in order to examine if medication status had a significant effect on the current results, we included this variable as a binary covariate (0\u00a0=\u00a0absent, 1\u00a0=\u00a0present). This did not change the results in question, except for marginally altering the voxel number within ANOVA clusters. \n\n\n### Multiple regression analysis \n  \nWe first conducted paired t-tests on Thayer/STAI scales in order to uncover significant differences between pre and post neurofeedback measures of state arousal and anxiety, respectively. In addition to Thayer/STAI scales, we also evaluated the following measures as predictors of amygdala complex connectivity changes as a result of the neurofeedback intervention: alpha amplitude change during neurofeedback (relative to baseline), pre-post resting alpha amplitude change, and baseline measures of total CAPS total, average MDI, average MDI depersonalization/derealization subscales. For amygdala complex connectivity, we used ImgCal in SPM12, to calculate both pre\u00a0>\u00a0post and post\u00a0>\u00a0pre contrasts, on the subject level. These extracted values we then entered into a multiple regression analyses (separate analysis for each amygdala complex and each predictor), utilizing the aforementioned error protection rate for follow-up ANOVA interaction analyses, in addition to separately examining the mPFC a-priori region-of-interest (FWE-corrected   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05,   k  \u00a0=\u00a010). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Subjective results from neurofeedback \n  \nWhen examining self-reports, 80% (17 of 21) of patients felt they had a sense of control over the feedback signal, and reported that they felt more relaxed, calm, and clear-minded after the neurofeedback session (see   for details). Strategies used to make the spaceship move, or decrease alpha amplitude, most commonly included focused visual attention. A number of participants also reported that feeling positive emotions induced spaceship movement, whereas inversely, trauma-related thoughts would stop spaceship movement. Interestingly, many participants reported not being as overwhelmed by trauma-related thoughts during neurofeedback. \n\nWhen examining the Thayer scores via paired t-tests, we detected a significant decrease in arousal after neurofeedback (  t  (20)\u00a0=\u00a02.72;   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05). Therefore this measure was used as a regressor in subsequent analyses. On the other hand, when examining STAI state anxiety scores, we did not observe a significant difference in pre and post neurofeedback values. \n\n\n### EEG spectral analysis \n  \nThe EEG results have been previously described by  . Via paired t-tests, we observed significantly reduced absolute alpha band amplitude during neurofeedback as compared to the first baseline, at both the Pz feedback site (  t  (20)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a03.19,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05), as well as the global average (  t  (20)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a03.21,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05), forming the basis of the \u201ctraining alpha change\u201d variable. In juxtaposition, paired   t  -tests showed a significant increase (rebound) in alpha amplitude during the second as compared to the first baseline, for both the Pz feedback site (  t  (20)\u00a0=\u00a03.54,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05) and global average (  t  (20)\u00a0=\u00a03.67,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05). This difference formed the basis of the \u201cresting alpha change\u201d variable, defined as the ratio between the average alpha amplitudes during the first and second baseline for each subject ( ). Notably, when controlling for absolute alpha amplitude at the first baseline, \u201ctraining alpha change\u201d was negatively correlated with \u201cresting alpha change\u201d for the global amplitude measure (global:   r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.52,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05; Pz:   r  \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.42,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.06); indicating that greater alpha decreases during neurofeedback, led to stronger increases in alpha after neurofeedback (i.e., larger \u201crebound\u201d). \n\n\n### One-sample amygdala complex functional connectivity \n  \nBriefly, both pre and post neurofeedback functional connectivity analyses displayed significant positive amygdala complex connectivity (bilateral BLA, CMA and SFA) to the PAG, lentiform nucleus of the putamen, PCC, and the anterior lobe culmen of the cerebellum (see Supplemental results;  ). Interestingly, when examining the mPFC a-priori region-of-interest, only the left CMA displayed significant connectivity to this region pre-neurofeedback; inversely, all amygdala complexes (bilateral BLA, CMA, SFA) displayed significant connectivity to the mPFC post-neurofeedback. Additionally, when examining pre neurofeedback functional connectivity, the left SFA displayed significant connectivity to the hippocampus, while the left CMA exhibited connectivity to red nucleus of the brainstem. \n\n\n### Differences in pre and post neurofeedback amygdala complex functional connectivity \n  \n#### Pre neurofeedback \n  \nWhen examining increased amygdala complex connectivity for the pre-neurofeedback as compared to the post-neurofeedback condition, we observed greater connectivity between the left BLA and the PAG, as well as between the left SFA and the left PAG and left hippocampus (see  ;  ). \n\n\n#### Post neurofeedback \n  \nInversely, when examining increased amygdala complex connectivity in the post-neurofeedback as compared to the pre-neurofeedback condition, we observed an increase in connectivity between the right CMA and the mPFC (see  ;  ). \n\n\n\n### Multiple regression analyses \n  \n#### CAPS total \n  \nAfter neurofeedback, patient CAPS total scores were negatively correlated to connectivity between the right BLA and right mPFC, and the right SFA and right PCC. Furthermore, greater CAPS scores after neurofeedback were positively correlated to connectivity between the left BLA and the left dorsal PAG, and between the left BLA and the left putamen (see  ;  ). \n\n\n#### Arousal \n  \nBefore neurofeedback, arousal was positively correlated with connectivity between the bilateral CMA and the dorsal PAG. After neurofeedback, greater calmness (decreased arousal) was significantly associated with connectivity between the bilateral BLA and right SFA to the right anterior lobe cerebellar culmen (see  ;  ). \n\n\n#### Resting alpha change \n  \nRelative changes in baseline alpha amplitude (resting alpha change), was negatively correlated to pre-neurofeedback connectivity between the left CMA and right SFA to the putamen (see  ;  ). \n\nMDI averaged scores, and MDI depersonalization/derealization averages, in addition to training alpha change, did not significantly predict differences in pre and post neurofeedback amygdala complex connectivity. Additionally, we identified outliers in both arousal and resting alpha change scores for the regression analyses via Cook's Distance criteria of >\u00a01, where distribution normality was also violated via Shapiro Wilks test. However, outliers and normality violations were resolved via a log 10 transformation of arousal and resting alpha change scores, where significant results remained throughout the analyses. Thus, our results proved to be outlier- independent, and statistical distribution assumptions were met. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe previously demonstrated that large-scale functional brain networks implicated in PTSD could be plastically modified using EEG alpha rhythm desynchronization \u2013 which was associated with symptom alleviation and a \u201crebound\u201d in alpha synchronization post neurofeedback ( ). Here we show that a 30-minute session of neurofeedback is also capable of shifting amygdala complex connectivity from \u201cbottom-up\u201d areas implicated in defensive, emotional, and fear processing/memory retrieval, to \u201ctop-down\u201d prefrontal emotion regulation regions. Consistent with neurocognitive models of PTSD ( ), this shift in amygdala complex connectivity was positively associated with reduced hyperarousal among patients, together with a stronger \u201crebound\u201d of alpha synchronization, and negatively correlated to PTSD symptom severity. \n\n### Therapeutic shift away from lower order regions \n  \nWe report increased connectivity before neurofeedback from the left BLA and left SFA to the PAG, as compared to the post neurofeedback condition, which may reflect increased fear and defense circuit processing in PTSD patients before the intervention. The PAG is a midbrain structure that is implicated in pain perception, analgesia, anxiety, defense circuits, and fear processing/expectancy ( ,  ,  ,  ). Moreover, the dorsolateral (dl)PAG, constituting current clusters, has been shown to be involved in \u201cactive\u201d sympathetic nervous system threat defenses ( ,  ), fear learning during life threatening situations ( ), and fight-or-flight responses, in which a critical amygdala-hypothalamus-PAG circuit has been delineated ( ). This suggests that the BLA and SFA amygdala complexes may be integrating emotional processes ( ,  ,  ) from the PAG related to active defense mechanisms and fight-or-flight responses, reflecting hyperarousal of emotions characteristic of PTSD patients prior to neurofeedback. In support of this,  ,   has proposed a model of \u201cneuroception\u201d, which allows individuals to subcortically assess environmental risks and safety, involving both the amygdala and PAG. Thus, hypermonitoring of neuroception may also be attenuated after neurofeedback. \n\nThe PAG is a central convergence zone involved in all basic emotional circuits in humans ( ). Interestingly,   has demonstrated that the PAG is involved in a broad spectrum of emotions, including fear and sadness, related to re-experiencing personal events. However, the PAG has largely been neglected in the PTSD and neuroimaging literature ( ). Here, when examining post vs. pre neurofeedback connectivity, CAPS scores were positively correlated to connectivity between the left BLA- left PAG, and reductions in PTSD arousal were negatively correlated to bilateral CMA- PAG connectivity, suggesting that higher levels of PTSD symptoms and arousal are associated with stronger amygdala-PAG connectivity profiles remaining after neurofeedback. \n\nIn line with these findings, hyperactivation has been reported in the amygdala and PAG during PTSD symptom provocation ( ), and   show that as a perceived threat moves closer, neural activity shifts from the ventromedial PFC to the PAG, where PAG activation was associated with pain expectancy, dread and perceived inability to escape. This has strong implications for PTSD hyperarousal due to chronic activation of defensive cascades and stress responses, involving the PAG, which may be activated recurrently after trauma in a suboptimal way ( ) (i.e., trauma threats may always be perceived as proximal in PTSD patients). Hence it has been suggested that decreasing amygdala-PAG activity may be a potential treatment to decrease anxiety ( ). \n\nIn the current study we also report increased connectivity from the left SFA to the hippocampus, before neurofeedback as compared to after, which may represent an exacerbated connection between emotional processing and autobiographical memory within PTSD patients before neurofeedback intervention. The hippocampus is reciprocally linked to the amygdala, where both are involved in fear and anxiety circuits ( ,  ), as well as autobiographical memory retrieval ( ). This suggests increased fear/anxiety circuit processing in relation to autobiographical memory in PTSD patients before neurofeedback, where the SFA is associated with affective/social processing ( ,  ,  ). Additionally, the hippocampus integrates contextual information into memories, gating amygdala emotional activity according to fear context ( ), where it has been suggested that hippocampal contextual functioning may be altered in patients with PTSD ( ). Hence, hippocampal dysfunction may reflect a failure to recognize safe contexts and aberrant memory function for neutral material ( ), paralleling hyperaroused emotional states within PTSD patients prior to intervention. On balance, aberrant hippocampal connectivity, and hyperactivation with the amygdala, have been associated with PTSD symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, and disorder severity ( ,  ,  ). This parallels our current findings as decreased PTSD symptoms were found to concatenate with decreased amygdala-hippocampal connectivity. Similarly,   report increased connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus among PTSD patients during traumatic reminders as compared to neutral processing, where the authors suggest this reflects over-generalized fear conditioning after trauma. In sum, decreased connectivity with the amygdala post neurofeedback treatment suggests normalization of this neural network, and perhaps less emotional arousal triggered by autobiographical trauma related memories. \n\nLastly, when examining post vs. pre neurofeedback connectivity, CAPS scores were positively correlated to connectivity between the left BLA and the left putamen. The putamen has recently been identified as a key region in the \u201chate circuit\u201d ( ), and has been associated with sensorimotor and stimulus response coordination ( ), showing implications for hypervigilance and readiness for action in PTSD. Furthermore, the putamen has been shown to be active during threat processing related to pain ( ) and during flashbacks of trauma in PTSD patients ( ). Similarly, increased alpha synchronization after desynchronizing neurofeedback (rebound), was negatively correlated with pre vs. post neurofeedback connectivity from the left CMA and right SFA to the putamen. Speculatively, putamen functions associated with threat processing, flashbacks, and hate circuitry, may be related to exacerbated PTSD symptoms pre neurofeedback, thereby negatively correlating to successful resting alpha change. \n\n\n### Therapeutic shift towards emotion regulation/modulation regions \n  \nIn the current study, we report a shift in amygdala connectivity from regions involved in fear processing and fear memory, to ventromedial emotion regulation cortical areas ( ). Here, we observed increased right CMA amygdala connectivity to the medial PFC after neurofeedback, as compared to pre neurofeedback. This suggests top-down emotional regulation over the amygdala ( ), where specifically the CMA is involved in the execution of fear responses ( ). Speculatively, this regulatory connection may underlie the alleviation of symptoms observed in PTSD patients after neurofeedback. In support of this mechanism, when examining post vs. pre neurofeedback connectivity, greater CAPS scores were negatively correlated to connectivity between the right BLA and right mPFC, where the BLA is involved in integrating cortical emotional processing ( ). Notably, when examining 1-sample   t  -tests, all amygdala complexes displayed functional connectivity to the medial PFC after neurofeedback, in juxtaposition to only the left CMA complex showing connectivity to the medial PFC before neurofeedback. \n\nOf importance, the medial PFC has direct anatomical projections to the amygdala and plays a central role in the \u201ctop-down regulation\u201d of amygdala processing ( ), the inhibition of negative affect ( ,  ), and amygdala activity during real-time fMRI neurofeedback emotion regulation ( ,  ,  ). On balance,   show that amygdala-dmPFC coupling is negatively correlated to negative affect, where inversely, hyperarousal has been associated with negative mPFC-amygdala coupling in PTSD patients ( ). In line with the current findings, it is widely accepted that PTSD patients are characterized by failed top-down inhibition of emotion generation regions, such as the amygdala ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), where mPFC activation has been negatively correlated to PTSD symptom severity ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Notably, increased mPFC activation has been reported when examining neural activity post treatment among PTSD patients ( ,  ,  ,  ). Hence, increased mPFC-amygdala coupling in the current study may be related to increased cortical modulation of the amygdala and negative affect, showing implications for arousal attenuation mechanisms through neurofeedback. \n\nAdditionally, for post vs. pre neurofeedback connectivity, reduced arousal was positively correlated with connectivity from the bilateral BLA and right SFA to the right anterior lobe cerebellar culmen, and greater CAPS scores were negatively correlated to connectivity between the right SFA and right PCC. Here, the cerebellar culmen has been shown to be involved in executive functioning and emotional processing ( ), suggesting emotional modulation over amygdala complexes after neurofeedback concomitant with reduced arousal. Furthermore, the posterior cingulate cortex is involved in directed attention ( ), suggesting that focused attention related to the neurofeedback task may help to facilitate calmness (reduced arousal). \n\nIn the present study, we have demonstrated that the cortex of PTSD patients is sufficiently plastic such that 30-minutes of targeted volitional activity via neurofeedback is capable of reconfiguring amygdala complex connectivity. Other recent studies have reported functional connectivity changes as a result of neurofeedback ( ,  ,  ). Specifically, the average elapsed time of 20\u00a0min following neurofeedback in which we obtained our second fMRI scan, is superior to the 15\u00a0min cut-off used to substantiate LTP (long-term potentiation) from STP (short-term potentiation) -like brain plasticity ( ). Hence, our experiment provides a temporally direct association between neurofeedback and plastic modulation of amygdala complex connectivity. Based on recent work, we expect that repeated sessions would be required to induce longer lasting effects that are stable for weeks/months ( ), which we hope to address with a randomized control trial currently underway in our laboratory. \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nFirst, as our EEG protocol has been validated in a randomized, placebo-controlled study with healthy individuals ( ), a sham-feedback region was not included in the current analysis. This was also done for ethical reasons as to mitigate feelings of frustration and failure, as well as to not attenuate benefits of neurofeedback treatment in the future ( ). Although, the objective of the current study was to investigate subcortical mechanisms related to behavioural and alpha oscillatory changes in patients. Here, the reported results can be viewed as more dependent, \u201ccause and effect\u201d relationships, as neurofeedback mitigates visual stimuli dependent factors in experimental designs, leading to greater intrinsic effects, produces the same reward contingencies across participants, and has variability in terms of success between participants ( ,  ). Hence neurofeedback represents an elegant way to \u201cclamp the external milieu\u201d, in order to delineate causal relationships ( ), as participants' entrained neuronal differences may be considered as resulting minimally from external factors and can instead be regarded as being driven by the modulation of intrinsic, stimulus-independent brain states. As a future direction, studies should include a psychiatric control group with disorders other than PTSD, and separately examine the dissociative subtype of PTSD. Moreover, subsequent experiments should employ simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings during resting state and neurofeedback, and examine the effects of general relaxation or focused attention. Our sample consisted of a large portion of patients on medication (although this did not appear to affect our results when conducting regression analyses). Effects of medication on neurofeedback should be more directly examined. Finally, effects of repeated administration of EEG neurofeedback should be investigated and studied longitudinally. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn summary, we show that after a 30-minute session of alpha amplitude reduction via EEG neurofeedback, amygdala complex connectivity concomitantly shifts from areas implicated in defensive, emotional, and fear processing/memory retrieval, to prefrontal emotion regulation regions. This shift in amygdala complex connectivity was positively associated with reduced arousal among PTSD patients and more alpha \u201crebound\u201d, and negatively correlated to PTSD symptom severity. These results have significant implications for developing non-invasive interventions that target alpha oscillations, and provides evidence of neuronal reconfiguration after neurofeedback between areas highly implicated in PTSD. This therapeutic shift from lower order regions to emotion regulation regions further suggests that future PTSD studies should examine the entire neural axis, devoting more attention to lower order brain regions, such as the PAG, given their central role in emotional processing. \n\nThe following is the supplementary data related to this article. \n\n\n## Funding and disclosure \n  \nThis research was supported by funding from   and from the  .

Pressure stimuli were performed in the nondominant hand thumb, divided into two stages, fixed pain and variable pain. \n\nThe two local Research Ethics Committees (Ethics Committee from Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo- Brazil, process number 0688/11, on July 1st, 2011 and Ethics Committee from Hospital Israelita Albert Einsten \u2013 Brazil, process number 1673, on October 19th, 2011) approved the study. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe idiopathic musculoskeletal pain (IMP) group showed a reduced threshold for pain (3.7\u00a0kg/cm  versus 4.45\u00a0kg/cm ,   p  \u2009=\u20090.005). Control group presented increased bain activation when compared to IMP group in the following areas: thalamus (  p  \u2009=\u20090.00001), precentral gyrus (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0004) and middle frontal gyrus (  p  \u2009=\u20090.03). In intragroup analysis, IMP group showed greater brain activation during the unpredictable stimuli of the variable pain stage, especially in the lingual gyrus (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0001), frontal lobe (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0001), temporal gyrus (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0001) and precentral gyrus (  p  \u2009=\u20090.03), when compared to predictable stimulus of fixed pain. The same intragroup analysis with the control group showed greater activation during the unpredictable stimuli in regions of the precentral gyrus (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0001), subcallosal area (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0001), right and left occipital fusiform gyrus (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0001; (  p  \u2009=\u20090.0007), middle gyrus (  p  \u2009=\u20090.01) and precuneus   p  \u2009=\u2009(0.02). \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nAdolescents with idiopathic musculoskeletal pain (IMP) tend to request higher brain function in cognitive-emotional areas when interpreting unpredictable sensory-perceptual situations. Therefore, it is assumed that this difference in pain processing in adolescents with IMP make the subjective experience of pain something more intense and unpleasant. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nAccording to criterias established by Malleson in 1992 [ ], Idiopathic musculoskeletal pain (IMP) is defined by the occurrence of intermittent and generalized musculoskeletal pain in three or more spots for at least 3 months, excluding other diseases, for example rheumatic, neoplastic and infectious diseases, which may justify the pain complaint [ ]. It affects around 12% to 35% of children and adolescents in school age [ \u2013 ]. Common in girls, the symptoms usually starts around 12\u201313\u00a0years and has its incidence peak at around 14\u00a0years [ ,  ], with significant impact and damage in social, school and family of patients [ ,  ,  ]. It is known that constitutional and environmental factors play an important role in triggering the IMP. There are a few hypotheses about the intrinsic factors related to IMP, which includes aspects of nociception and factors related to the pain threshold, in this case a differentiation in the the pain-related activation areas in the brain [ \u2013 ]. \n\nSince 1968, the basic understanding about pain comes from the theory proposed by Melzack and Casey [ ], where the pain processing occurs through sensory and emotional components processed in parallel by different brain structures. Therefore, sensory-discriminative aspects, such as type, location and intensity, are processed by areas such as lateral thalamus, somatosensory cortex 1 and 2 (S1 and S2) and posterior parietal cortex, while affective-motivational aspects are processed by areas such as thalamus lateral, prefrontal cortex and limbic system [ \u2013 ]. After some additional studies, cingulate became part of this network [ ]. \n\nIn an attempt to expand the research about the brain mechanisms of pain processing in recent years, studies have been conducted with the aid of refined neuroimaging techniques and paradigms of experimental pain in patients with musculoskeletal pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia and complex regional pain [ ,  ,  \u2013 ]. These studies, performed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), demonstrated that adult patients with fibromyalgia (FM), a subclassification of IMP syndromes, tolerate a smaller amount of pressure (pain) and showed differences in brain activation patterns in cortical and subcortical areas related to pain, especially in the cortex of the cingulate, insula, S1 and S2, as well as brain volume changes, when compared to healthy controls, i.e. without complaints of chronic pain [ ,  ,  ]. Studies with fMRI in adults that evaluated the aging effect on the brain showed changes in the pattern of gray and white matter in accordance with the age of patients with fibromyalgia, as well as a strong correlation between smaller amount of gray and white matter with greater sensitivity to pain [ ]. Lebel et al. suggest that changes resulting from chronic pain occurring at a time of intense development and neuroplasticity may modify the pain processing mode in adolescents with complex regional syndrome [ ]. However, there is no data on when these changes get started and few studies involving children and adolescents with IMP. \n\nThe main objective of this pioneer study was to evaluate, using fMRI techniques, the brain activation in adolescents with IMP during an experimental paradigm of pain. As hypothesis, different patterns of brain activation are expected in areas related to pain matrix (primary and secondary somatosensory, insular, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortices and thalamus) [ \u2013 ]. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nModel: Descriptive, cross-sectional case-control study. \n\n### Ethical aspects \n  \nThe two local Research Ethics Committees (Ethics Committee from Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo- Brazil, process number 0688/11, on July 1st, 2011 and Ethics Committee from Hospital Israelita Albert Einsten \u2013 Brazil, process number 1673, on October 19th, 2011) approved the study. All participants and their guardians were informed about the procedures, risks and conducts. The fMRI was performed after the signature of the consent form. All participants and their guardians agreed to the study and future publications of the results. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nFrom a population of 74 IMP patients (aged between 5 and 18\u00a0years old) followed in our pediatric musculoskeletal pain clinic, 12 adolescents were consecutively selected according to the criteria of Malleson et al. 1992 [ ]. All patients were under medical treatment by a pediatric rheumatologist for at least 6\u00a0months. There were excluded patients with following clinical aspects: history of psychiatric and/or neurological disorders diagnosticated by neurologist or history of, traumatic brain injury; use of drug or psychoactive drugs; incidental findings and changes in neural structural images, such as tumors and cysts; patients with fMRI contraindications conditions, such as use of metal clips, implants, braces or unremovable piercings. \n\nThe fMRI exam was then applied to 12 adolescents with IMP, aged between 14 and 17\u00a0years, of both genders and 11 matched controls, without history of pain, tanner stage 5 [ ], selected in the same social groups (school and neighborhood) through indications made by adolescents with IMPTwo subjects from IMP group were excluded, one due to use of braces and another due diagnosis of Turner syndrome. \n\nBoth participants of the IMP group, during the recruitment telephone contact did not report the existence of conditions incompatible with the selection criteria (hidden dental braces and the diagnosis of Turner syndrome). These conditions were only observed when the adolescents were already in the research institute and, finally, and 1 adolescent from the control group due to incidental finding of a cyst. The final sample consisted of 20 adolescents, 10 allocated in IMP group (9 girls and 1 boy, average age 16.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1) and 10 healthy adolescents in the control group (9 girls and 1 boy, mean age 16.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4) with no complaint of pain. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that all adolescents of the IMP group also had positive diagnosis for juvenile fibromyalgia, according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria [ ,  ]. \n\nNone of the adolescents were under continuous use of pain medication, yet they were all advised not to use any pain medications (including prescription-free) during the last 24\u00a0h before the test. \n\n\n### Procedures \n  \n#### Sample characterization \n  \nThe sample was characterized as the following questionnaires: A)   Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory - Version 4.0 (PedsQL 4.0) Brazilian adaptation for free use   [ ] - measurement of children\u2019s quality of life and healthy adolescents and patients with chronic diseases, parents and tens Version; B)   Stress Scale in Adolescents \u2013 ESA   [ ] - evaluation of symptoms related to stress reactions; C)   Beck Depression Inventory - BDI-II   [ ] - evaluation of symptoms corresponding to DSM-IV criteria for diagnosing depressive disorders; D)   Visual analogue scale \u2013 VAS   [ ] - quantification of pain intensity. \n\n\n#### Pain paradigm \n  \nDiscrete pressure stimuli, lasting 2\u00a0s, were applied to the nondominant thumb by means of hard rubber tube connected to a hydraulic piston, which were connected by a combination of a second piston valve. This second piston transmitted the pressure of standardized weights laid out on a platform for controlled and reproducible pressure stimuli. The experimental pain equipment is designed exclusively for the study of fMRI [ ]. \n\nIt was used a paradigm of event-related design, divided into two steps: 1)   Fixed Pain  , in which for 6\u00a0min participant received 22 pressure stimuli of pain subjective to score 6 (six) with interval of 16\u00a0s, preceded by display of a cross symbol on the screen, as shown in Fig.\u00a0 ; 2)   Variable pain  , in which for 12\u00a0min participant received 45 randomly distributed pressure stimuli were applied every 16\u00a0s, however with 2 different intensity possibilities (0.5\u00a0kg/cm  or equivalent pressure to score 6) in 3 conditions: A)   predictable pain stimuli  , when the participant visualize a square (\u25a0) on the screen and then received the pressure stimulus with intensity equivalent to score 6 of pain; B)   unpredictable pain stimuli  , when participants visualized a diamond (\u25c6), then, could receive either a pressure stimulus score 0 (zero) or score 6 (six) in order to not be able to predict what stimulus would be administered. C)   neutral stimuli  , a triangle (\u0394) was presented on the screen and then received the pressure stimulation with intensity of 0.5\u00a0kg/cm , corresponding to score 0 (zero) pain, as shown in Fig.\u00a0 .   \nExperimental design of the fixed pain \n    \nExperimental design of the variable pain \n  \n\nThe same protocol was applied to all participants, with all steps described above. They were not previously informed about the meaning of each symbol visualized prior to the stimuli (ie, which symbol would be followed by pain, non-pain, and unpredictable stimuli). \n\n\n#### Calibration of pressure stimuli \n  \nThe intensity of the stimuli was previously calibrated for each participant. Each participant was asked to verbally graduate the intensity of the pain felt for each stimulus by a numeral analog scale of 0 to 10. The session consisted of an ascending series of pressure stimuli, starting with 0.5\u00a0kg/cm  and increasing 0.5\u00a0kg/cm  to the limit of tolerance or up to 9.0\u00a0kg/cm . \n\nThe stimuli were applied twice in ascending order and, within a short break, applied a third time in descending order to confirm the degree of pressure. For each participant, the pain threshold was defined as the greatest stimulus, whose intensity received at least two equal scores, being assigned to it, score 6 (six) of pain on a scale of 0 to 10. Our study followed the same parameters and methodology adopted by international studies [ ,  ,  \u2013 ,  ]. \n\n\n#### fMRI instrumentation \n  \nAll tests were performed in a 3.0\u00a0T Magnetom Trio equipment: TIM System (Siemens Medical - Germany) with 40 mT/m gradients, increase ratio of 230 mT/m/s and dedicated receptive coil of 12 elements. \n\nFunctional images were acquired by sequence of T2 echo planar image (EPI-BOLD) for the whole brain, capturing the signal contrast variations according to the   Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent   (BOLD) effect with the following conditions: - GRE EPI T2 - BOLD: TR\u2009=\u20092000\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u00a0ms, thickness of 5\u00a0mm, 0.5\u00a0mm range, FOV 200\u00a0mm and matrix of 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964, with 405 volumes, neglecting the first 4 TR\u2019s, for the decrement signal. \n\nBOLD contrast is the MR imaging method most often used to produce information related to brain function. \n\nThis method is based on MR images made sensitive to changes in the state of oxygenation of the hemoglobin [ ]. This molecule has diVerent magnetic properties depending on the concentration of O2; when it is fully saturated with oxygen (oxyhemoglobin) it behaves as a diamagnetic substance, while when some oxygen atoms have been removed (deoxyhemoglobin) it becomes paramagnetic. \n\nWithin any particular imaging voxel (representing a small part of the brain) the proportion of deoxyhemoglobin relativeto oxyhemoglobin dictates how the MR signal will behave in a BOLD image: areas with high concentration of oxyhemoglobin give a higher signal (a brighter image) than areas with low concentration [ ]. \n\nFor stimulus presentation and acquisition of behavioral responses was used the NNL system (NordicNeuroLab Inc., Norway) via dedicated algorithm (E-prime -   Psychology Software Tools, Inc., USA  ). This system uses independent binocular projection via LCD screen and hand response detection through keyboard compatible with magnetic environment. \n\n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nAll behavioral data were exposed as   average\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation  . The variables were compared between groups using the Student-t test for independent samples in the Statistica Software (Statsoft). The significance level of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 was adopted. \n\nThe obtained functional images were processed and analyzed by the statistical program FSL version 4.1 (FMRIB Software Library - Analysis Group, Oxford, UK -  ), specifically the FEAT module (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) version 5.98 (to detect brain activation based on changes in the BOLD signal). \n\nThe data were processed in three steps: pre-processing, statistical analysis and presentation of the activation images. Individual activation maps were obtained using the general linear model (GLM). \n\nThe images obtained from the statistical analysis with Student-t test indicated the regions where the signal varied significantly when comparing to the periods of activation and rest. It was calculated, for each pixel, the activation coefficient and the corresponding z-score. Analyzing the BOLD signal corresponding to the fMRI signal difference between the activation states and rest, the z-score is calculated taking into account the average value (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3). \n\nA minimum statistical threshold of 1.9 (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05) was used to determine which voxels have been activated during the pain paradigm execution. The anatomical regions were identified by overlapping those on structural images. The maps of the atlas system MNI 152 (Montreal Neurological Institute) and Harvard-Oxford, available in FSLview software, were used for the classification of the active areas. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nTable\u00a0  presents demographic data, years of schooling, PedsQL 4.0, SSA, BDI, and pain VAS for idiopathic musculoskeletar pain syndrome patients and controls. In the total sample, 3 participants were left-handed (1 in IMP group and 2 in the control group).

The IMP patients also reported complaints of spontaneous pain, with an average score of 3/10 (VAS) in the pre-exam time. \n\nFrom a clinical point of view, based on the results obtained on the scales, it is possible to say that our sample showed no differences in the occurrence of stress-related symptoms (SSA: 2.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8;   p  \u2009=\u20090.08), nor indicative symptoms of depression (BDI-II: 10\u2009\u00b1\u200910.4;   p  \u2009=\u20090.15). Means and standard deviations of the sample characterization are shown in Table\u00a0 . \n\n### Intergroup analysis \n  \n#### Weight used \n  \nThe adolescents of the IMP group demonstrated a significantly reduced pain threshold when compared to healthy adolescent group (3.7\u00a0kg/cm  versus 4.45\u00a0kg/cm ,   p  \u2009=\u20090.005). By the end of the experiment, the average pain score reported by the participants for this pressure stimuli in the fMRI paradigm was 7.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7, on a scale of 0 to 10, varying from the initial score of 6. \n\n\n#### Fixed pain \n  \nThe comparison between the two groups during execution of fixed pain paradigm, i.e. maximum calibrated pressure to each individual, equivalent to subjective pain equal to 6 (IMP group, 3.7\u00a0kg/cm \u2009\u00b1\u20090.483\u00a0kg/cm ; Controls, 4.45\u00a0kg/cm \u2009\u00b1\u20090.685\u00a0kg/cm ), showed increased brain activation in the control group, as shown in Fig.\u00a0 , when compared to the IMP group in 3 clusters: the thalamus, precentral gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. Table\u00a0  describes the main anatomical sections of greater activation according to the MNI coordinates.

In this table are also described the main areas and location of the activated voxels within these four clusters, while presenting the pressure stimuli.   \n3D map view and sagittal (  s  ) and axial (  a  ) cuts of the difference in activation between the unpredictable stimuli of variable pain versus fixed pain stimuli in IMP group \n    \nDescription of significantly higher activation clusters during unpredictable variable pain IMP group when compared to fixed pain \n  \nThe presented coordinates refer to the location of the maximum activation voxel within each cluster.

The brain activation results pointed to areas mainly related to the pain affective-motivational domain. To our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study about the brain function using an experimental paradigm of pain in a group of adolescents with IMP. \n\nIn addition to imaging studies, other relevant issues on IMP were evaluated, such as quality of life and the occurrence of indicative symptoms of stress and depression. \n\nSince our sample included a population in age from full development and brain plasticity, we took care to pair the factors with possible influences on brain development, such as age and educational level. \n\nIn our clinical practice, IMP adolescents and their families come to clinic visits with many complaints about social and emotional difficulties in their day-to-day. The poor PedsQL 4.0 scores showed the perception of adolescents with IMP. As expected, we observed worst scores in physical, educational, emotional and social dimensions of patients. \n\nAlso, behavioral data indicates similarities in relation to emotional aspects in both groups. The occurrence of stress and depression disorders in both groups was not identified. \n\nDepression is highlighted as one of the most common symptoms in adult patients with IMP, especially in fibromyalgia [ ,  ], still being related to differences in brain processing of pain in these patients [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nUnlike the findings in adults, but corroborating previous studies [ ] for the pediatric population, our negative results for symptoms of stress or depression suggest that, despite a number of complaints and functional impairment, adolescents with IMP do not seem to yet experience significant mood changes found in adults with chronic pain. \n\nThe search for factors related to pain pathogenesis is in a fruitful field, because little is known about the subject. Recent studies show that the uses of matched experimental paradigms to sophisticated neuroimaging techniques allow a better understanding of brain mechanisms of pain processing. Pain is a complex and subjective experience recruiting the operation of multiple and different brain areas, including the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus and insula [ ]. \n\nHowever, cerebral pain processing is not limited only to these locations, since simple stimulus like sting of a needle or pressure on the skin can lead to activation of a larger number of brain areas located in cortical and subcortical areas. Studies on the assessment of brain response through paradigms of experimental pain in patients with chronic pain suggests that greater sensitivity to stimuli reported by these patients is accompanied by increased brain responses [ ,  ]. \n\nThe relevance of the research of brain processing during pain also in the pediatric population should be the search for better outcomes and behaviors in order to minimize long-term damage caused by chronic pain. Lebel et al., in the only study with fMRI in pediatric patients with complex regional pain syndrome, suggest that due to chronic pain changes in the central nervous system that occur in this stage of development and neuroplasticity may alter the pain processing on these individuals during their lifes [ ]. \n\nDuring calibration of pressure stimuli, adolescents with IMP had a lower pain threshold than their healthy peers, similar to what happens in adults with pain idiopathic syndromes [ ,  ]. \n\nIn the fixed pain paradigm used in our study, all presented pressure stimuli had the same intensity, at constant intervals. In this paradigm, the control group showed greater brain activation compared to the group with IMP, and these activations were in areas related to sensory perception, motor perception and pain perception, such as thalamus, S1 and S2. Unlike most studies with adults [ ,  ,  ,  ], our results suggest a greater activation of areas only in healthy adolescents, i.e. areas related to sensory-discriminative aspects of pain. However, we must highlight the fact that all adolescents IMP group reported some kind of spontaneous pain, with grades ranging from 2 to 4 in the VAS scale (0\u201310), since even before the administration of pressure tests, a fact absolutely opposite to the control group. This is not mentioned in studies with adults [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nThis finding is relevant, especially when we analyze the results of the next stage, when the unpredictability factor was added to variable pain paradigm. When exposed to unpredictable pain stimuli, both groups showed greater brain activation when compared to fixed paradigm pain stimuli. \n\nIn IMP group, the main differences occurred in areas related to processing information related to emotional aspects, such as self-awareness and emotional regulation (precuneos, cingulate gyrus, subcallosal area) and also in areas involved in the interpretation of sensory stimuli, as images and somesthesic information and motor (temporal gyrus, pre and poscentral gyrus). In contrast, in the control group, the main activation clusters were in areas involved in the interpretation of sensory stimuli, such as image processing, somesthesic information and motor (temporal gyrus, pre and poscentral gyrus, fusiform gyrus and middle temporal gyrus) and you can also identify clusters in areas emotional regulation (precuneos and subcallosal area). \n\nThus, in general, both groups showed an increase in the BOLD effect during the unpredictable pressure stimuli compared to fixed pressure stimuli. However, it is possible to notice a difference in the pattern of this increase in activation, especially in IMP group, where the main areas of activation related to the affective-motivational system, for example, the cortex of the cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex. \n\nIt is possible to observe the role of the cingulate gyrus to process unpleasant aspects of pain, such as the integration of these sensations with affection, cognition and selection behavioral response [ ]. Since the role of the prefrontal cortex is associated with better motivational and anticipatory aspects of pain [ ]. Cognitive and affective factors, such as attention, anticipation and anxiety, can also be understood as aspects not related to pain. However, these factors can influence the modulation of pain perception due to the fact of pain processing is also closely related to brain areas related to these aspects [ ]. It is important to consider that our experimental paradigm was not specifically designed to detect involvement of anxiety and anticipation in pain, as participants were previously instructed on the meanings of the symbols that preceded the pressure stimuli, although they could deduce over time. The purpose of this design was to investigate the impact of unpredictability and participation of involuntary attention in pain processing. In the study of Petzke et al. [ ], thermal and pressure, stimuli with different intensities presented randomly caused increased brain activation in both adult controls as in adult patients with fibromyalgia, when compared to stimuli presented in ascending order. \n\nAs already shown in some studies with adults [ ,  ,  ], adolescents in our study demonstrate significantly increased BOLD effect in regions involved in emotional/cognitive aspects related to pain processing, reinforcing the hypothesis that affective/emotional aspects attributed to the frontal-cingulate regions that have a relevant role on pain processing also in adolescents with IMP. \n\nPerhaps these differences in processing are indicative factors that lead some people to experience more pain.This circuit frontal-cingulate seems to be a key component in the process of understanding how the pain processing occur in adolescents with IMP, since it is involved in functional executive systems as well as pain-related systems. In the lights of our findings, we can assume that these adolescents require more brain effort in cognitive-emotional areas when interpreting unpredictable sensory-perceptual event.. \n\nIn our study, some factors associated with pain within menstruation cycle, time with pain and type of therapeutic treatment (medical, psychological, physiotherapy among others) were not considered in the analysis. The sample size is small, even if we take into account the socioeconomic, educational and emotional aspects have been considered. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn front of new or conflicting situations, our results suggests that adolescents IMP tend to request higher brain function in order to interpret them. In addition, these regions, known to be also involved in attentional and executive processes (mainly in the selection of responses and/or conflict resolution) are also required in the processing of pain. Therefore, it is assumed that this difference in pain processing in adolescents with IMP make the subjective experience of pain something more intense and unpleasant. Our results emphasize the importance of early diagnostics and constant therapeutic monitoring as these may prevent the occurrence of mood disorders, common in adults with IMP. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tIMP\tControls\tp Value\nN=\t10\t10\tUnnamed: 3_level_1\nAge\t16.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.09\t16.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\t0.36\nYears of schooling\t10\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\t9.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\t0.28\nPedsQL Parents\t1205\u2009\u00b1\u2009491\t1935\u2009\u00b1\u2009473\t0.003\nPedsQL Adolescents\t1470\u2009\u00b1\u2009399\t1872\u2009\u00b1\u2009246\t0.007\nSSA\t2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\t1.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\t0.08\nBDI-II\t12.4\u2009\u00b1\u200911.6\t7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9\t0.15\nPain score pre examination \u2013 VAS\t3.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\t0\t<0.0001a\nWeight used (= grade 6/10)\t3.7\u00a0kg/cm2\t4.45kh/cm2\t0.005\n### Caption\nDemographic data, years of schooling, PedsQL, SSA, BDI-II, and VAS for idiopathic musculoskeletar pain syndrome patients and controls\n### Footer\nPedsQL parents Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory - Version answered by parents, PedsQL Adolescents Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory - Version answered by adolescents, SSA Stressscale for adolescentss minimum required score\u2009=\u20093.11, BDI-II Beck Depression Inventory, minimum required score\u2009=\u200913, VAS visual analogue scaleaStatistical Valor p\u2009=\u20090.000000000008\n\n\n## ID: Tab2\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tUnnamed: 1_level_0\tUnnamed: 2_level_0\tMNI Coordinatesb\tMNI Coordinatesb\tMNI Coordinatesb\tUnnamed: 6_level_0\tUnnamed: 7_level_0\nLocalization\tSide\tCluster size\tx\ty\tz\tZ score\tp Value\n1.

{"text": "Shi, Yu and Zeng, Yanyan and Wu, Lei and Liu, Ziping and Zhang, Shanshan and Yang, Jianming and Wu, Wen\nSci Rep, 2017\n\n# Title\n\nA Study of the Brain Functional Network of Post-Stroke Depression in Three Different Lesion Locations\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nResearch on the mechanism of post stroke depression (PSD) is the key way to improve the treatment of PSD. However, the functional brain network of PSD has not been entirely supported by the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. The aims of this study are to investigate the brain response of PSD in three different lesions. The brain responses of the three PSD subgroups were similar. However, each subgroup had its own characteristics of the brain network. In the temporal lobe subgroup, the right thalamus had increased degree centrality (DC) values which were different from the other two subgroups. In the frontal lobe subgroup, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, caudate, and postcentral gyrus had increased DC values which were different from the other two subgroups. The hemodynamic response of PSD indicates that PSD has activities of similar emotional networks, of which the negative network realizes its function through the limbic system and default mode network. The brain network has unique characteristics for different lesion locations. The neurological function of the lesion location, the compensatory mechanism of the brain, and the mechanism of integrity and locality of the brain are the important factors in the individual emotional network. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPost-stroke depression (PSD) is considered to be the most frequent and important neuropsychiatric consequence of a stroke that negatively affects patient outcome . A recent systematic review revealed that the frequency of PSD is 33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29% to 36%) . Persistent depression not only increases disease deterioration, but also causes reduced social function, and increases the risk of suicide . Consequently, research on the mechanism of PSD is vital and provides an invaluable tool to improve the treatment efficacy of PSD. \n\nBrain imaging technology is increasingly being used by researchers to study the mechanism of PSD . Studies have shown that several brain areas play an important role in the mechanism of PSD, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (Amyg), thalamus, and hippocampus (HP) . In our previous research, we found that the gray matter density (GMD) of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and HP was lower in PSD patients . Based on these observations, some researchers have summarized as the mechanism of emotional circuit imbalance of PSD . \n\nHowever, most previous studies (including that of the authors\u2019 group) did not include an analysis of the brain network of PSD in different patient types . Instead, all types of patients were grouped together for analysis, without paying attention to the basic factors of stroke such as type of stroke, location and size of lesion, and duration of disease. Many studies have shown that factors such as type of stroke and duration of disease, affect the development of PSD , and that there is an association between PSD and specific lesion locations or hemisphere. Mood disorders of PSD are more likely to occur at specific lesion locations of stroke, such as the ganglia and left PFC , which highlights that different lesion locations have different effects on the disease. In addition, it is well known that the frontal lobe plays an important role in emotional regulation, and frontal lobe stroke can result in mood disorders. In clinical practice, however, parietal lobes which are not closely related to the emotional network also contribute to depressive symptoms, suggesting that stroke at different lesions/lobe may have unique brain network characteristics acting on the emotional network. Therefore, grouping all types of patients together for analysis would result in a high heterogeneity of subjects. As such, it is important to conduct a brain network research on single types of PSD patients, thereby improving the reliability of the conclusions. \n\nIn recent years, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been extensively used to understand the mechanism of brain function . Among the methods of rs-fMRI data analysis, functional connection (FC) and independent component analysis (ICA) are the most commonly used for examining connectivity patterns in distinct brain regions . In the FC method, researchers generally need to select an a priori defined region of interest (ROI) before analysis. However, for poorly understood brain networks, it is very difficult to select an a   priori   defined ROI, and this affects the reliability of the conclusions. Compared with the FC method, the ICA method may be performed without a   priori   selection . although it is difficult to distinguish the results as physiological noise or real brain response; this also affects the reliability of the results. At present, an increasing number of researchers are focusing on a new method termed degree centrality (DC) . DC can count the number of direct connections for a given voxel in a brain network and reflect its FC within that network, without requiring an a   priori   defined ROI. Based on voxel level, DC technology takes each element as a node, and then calculates the amount of each node connecting with other nodes. This indirectly reflects the position and importance of the node or brain regions in the whole-brain networks . Converging evidence indicates that DC is one of the main topological properties measured in graph theory analysis, and provides as an effective index. It has been widely used to identify changes in resting-state functional networks in mental illness, including depression , schizophrenia  and autism. However, no literature is available on PSD research based on the DC method. This method provides a promising tool for the elucidation of the neural basis of PSD because it does not require an a   priori   defined ROI. \n\nThe frontal, temporal and parietal lobes serve as the main donor brain areas of the internal carotid artery system, the three lobes are closely related to advanced brain function (i.e. emotion, cognition and memory) and is the predilection site of stroke . Stroke in these brain regions is also the focus of current research. \n\nTo reduce heterogeneity, we chose patients with three lesion locations (temporal, frontal and parietal lobes) with similar stroke type, duration, size of lesion, and other basic factors. Moreover, healthy volunteers with approximate conditions were selected as the blank control group (baseline). Our aim in the present investigation was to compare the brain response of PSD and non-PSD (non-depression after stoke) subjects by grouping fMRI datasets into three different lesion locations. We hypothesized that each different type of PSD has a unique feature of the brain network, but there are also some similarities between them. Through this research, we will contribute to the further understanding of the mechanism of PSD, and provide a bridge for future studies. \n\n\n## Method and Subjects \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe reviewed the charts of 133 patients who were admitted for ischemic stroke between December 2012 and June 2017 to the Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University. Patients were included if they met the following criteria. Firstly, the subjects met the WHO criteria for the diagnosis of cerebral infarction, which is based on both the presence of neurological symptoms and a compatible lesion, as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); secondly, the subjects were in the recovery period (3 months <disease duration <1 year) with stable symptoms; thirdly, the subjects had a single infarcted brain area (3\u20135\u2009cm) in the right temporal, frontal, or parietal lobe; fourthly, the subjects had a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of six or lower; fifthly, the subjects were conscious and able to cooperate with the interview, and provide informed consent, and complete the scale evaluations and a clinical interview for the diagnosis of depression; sixthly, the subjects had basic self-care ability in their daily lives (Barthel Index score\u2009\u2265\u200960); seventhly; the subjects were aged between 60 and 70 years; eighthly, the subjects did not have a history of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke; ninthly, the subjects did not have obvious cognitive dysfunction disorder and language understanding disorder; tenthly, the subjects did not have a history of schizophrenia, major depression, anxiety, dementia, drug abuse, or antidepressant use at stroke onset, or a family history of mental disorders; eleventhly, the subjects were not alcoholics or drug abusers. twelfthly, all subjects were right-handed. After a detailed evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 72 patients who suffered from ischemic stroke participated in this study (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nPatients flow in this study. The screened subjects had one or more conditions that did not meet the inclusion criteria. \n  \n\nWe also recruited healthy volunteers of similar age, educational background and lifestyle to the stroke patients, with no history of neuropsychiatric disorders or drug abuse. After screening, 15 healthy volunteers were included in the blank control group (baseline). \n\nThe following information was collected for each subject: demographics (i.e., age, gender, education level, and whether they lived alone) and stroke severity, as measured by the NIHSS at the time of admission to the hospital. Simultaneously, we obtained scores on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Barthel Index (BI). \n\nAll the experiments and protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhujiang Hospital which is affiliated with the Southern Medical University, China . According to the dictates of the State Council of China, each subject provided written informed consent after receiving detailed instructions and full explanations on the experimental procedures. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. \n\nThe stroke subjects were divided into three subgroups based on their different lesion locations, 1) temporal lobe group, 2) frontal lobe group and 3) parietal lobe group. An experienced neuropsychologist performed the clinical interview to diagnose depression, according to DSM-IV criteria. The severity of depression was assessed using the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-24). For inclusion in the depression group (PSD group) in our final analysis, participants had to meet DSM-IV criteria for depressive disorder, and score at least 17 on the HAMD. The other participants were assigned to the non-PSD group. \n\n\n### Brain imaging \n  \nThe experiment was performed in the Department of Radiology of Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, China. Anatomical scans of the brain were collected prior to stimulation imaging. Then, all subjects were subjected to an rs-fMRI scan for six minutes. \n\nStructural and functional scans were acquired with a 3.0\u2009T Philips Achieva MRI System (Royal Philips Electronics, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) with an eight-channel head array coil equipped for echo planar imaging. The images were axial and parallel to the anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure line, which covered the whole brain. Structural images were collected prior to functional imaging using a T1-weighted fast spin echo sequence (repetition time/echo time\u2009=\u2009500/14\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, 0.859\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.859\u2009mm in-plane resolution, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm). Blood oxygenation level-dependent functional imaging was acquired using a T2*-weighted, single-shot, gradient-recalled echo planar imaging sequence (repetition time/echo time\u2009=\u20092000/40\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, 3.4\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093.4\u2009mm in-plane resolution, 180 time points for a total of 360\u2009seconds). In addition, fMRI image collection was preceded by five dummy scans to minimize gradient distortion. \n\n\n### Preprocessing of experimental functional MRI data \n  \nThe fMRI image data were preprocessed and analyzed using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF,  ) by routines in MATLAB R2010a. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series preprocessing steps included removal of the first 10 volumes, slice-time correction, motion correction, intensity normalization, spatial smoothing, and linear high-pass temporal filtering. The first 10 volumes of each scan were discarded in order to eliminate any non-equilibrium effects of magnetization and to allow subjects to become familiar with the scanning environment. The motion time courses were used to select subjects\u2019 head movements of <2\u2009mm in translation and 2\u00b0 in rotation (no subjects were excluded). Each individual\u2019s functional images were normalized using the symmetric echo-planar imaging templates and resampled at a resolution of 3\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm. The normalized functional images were smoothed spatially using a 6\u2009mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel . Finally, voxel-wise linear trend removal and temporal high-pass filtering (0.01\u2009Hz\u2009<\u2009f\u2009<\u20090.08\u2009Hz) were applied. \n\n\n### DC Calculation \n  \nWeighted DC measures were calculated using the \u201cREST-DC\u201d toolkit in the REST V1.8 package , as previously described . To obtain each participant\u2019s graph, Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between the time series of all pairs of brain voxels. Each voxel represented a node in the graph, and each significant functional connection (i.e., Pearson correlation) between any pair of voxels was an edge. As a result, we obtained an n\u2009\u00d7\u2009n matrix of Pearson correlation coefficients between any pair of voxels to construct the whole-brain FC matrix for each participant. Then, individual correlation matrices were transformed into a Z-score matrix using Fisher\u2019s r-to-z transformation to improve normality. The weighted DC strength of a voxel as the sum of the connections (Z-values) between a given brain voxel and all other voxels was then computed. To eliminate possible spurious connectivity, we used the Pearson correlation coefficient at r\u2009>\u20090.25 by thresholding each correlation at P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001 . Furthermore, standardized weighted DC maps were acquired by subtracting the mean value, and then dividing by the standard deviation within the whole gray matter mask . \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nSPSS 18.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to calculate descriptive statistics (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) for psychophysical data. All statistical assessments were two-tailed, and we considered results to be significant at p\u2009<\u20090.05, consistent with the preliminary status of the trial. \n\nThe DC value differences between PSD and non-PSD, and differences between non-PSD and baseline were calculated using two-tailed, paired t-tests (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and corrected for multiple comparisons [false discovery rate [FDR] (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in rest ( ). The resulting images were shown by rest. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Patient characteristics \n  \n87 subjects (female\u2009=\u200944) were recruited into the study, of whom 72 were stroke patients and 15 were healthy subjects. The mean age of the study sample was 64.60\u2009\u00b1\u20093.66 (range 60\u201370) years. Thirty-three of the stroke patients of (45.8%, 33/72) were diagnosed with PSD. There were 21 subjects in the temporal lobe subgroup, 30 subjects in the frontal lobe subgroup, and 21 subjects in the parietal lobe subgroup. A statistical difference was found in the HAMD score between the PSD and non-PSD groups for all three subgroups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). No significant differences were observed in the basic data (i.e., age, sex, education, duration, and whether they lived alone) and functional assessment scores (i.e., MMSE score, BI score and NIHSS score) amongst the three groups (p\u2009>\u20090.05).

However, DC values were greater in brain areas such as the temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus (PHP), insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), caudate, and supplementary motor area (SMA) (See Table\u00a0 ; Fig.\u00a0 ). The brain network of each subgroup showed distinct characteristics. For example, our research demonstrated that the right thalamus in the temporal lobe subgroup showed higher DC values than the other two subgroups (See Table\u00a0  & Fig.\u00a0 ). In the frontal lobe subgroup, the DC values of the left DLPFC, caudate, and postcentral gyrus were higher than the other two subgroups (See Table\u00a0  & Fig.\u00a0 ). In addition, for the parietal lobe subgroup, the frontal lobe area of the brain showed decreased DC values compared to the other subgroups (See Table\u00a0  & Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nThe DC values of PSD in three subgroups (P\u2009<\u20090.05, FDR\u2009<\u20090.05). \n  \nAbbreviations: FDR, false discovery rate; MNI, Montreal Neurologi-cal Institute.

This result suggests that, under the strict inclusion criteria, differences in age and gender amongst the three subgroups had minor influence. This led to reduced heterogeneity of the experiment and improvements in the reliability of the conclusion. Previous studies have shown that PSD results from brain injury and nerve damage caused by stroke, the severity of which is an important factor in PSD . In our study, there were no significant differences in NIHSS score, MMSE score and BI score between the PSD and non-PSD groups. Although the stroke subjects showed similar degrees of nerve damage, some individuals did not appear to present depressive symptoms. This suggests that nerve damage may not be a key determining factor for PSD, and other factors are more influential in the onset of depression. \n\n### Non-PSD brain response \n  \nOur results indicate that non-PSD can extensively alter the excitability of the brain network, including stroke lesions and remote sites. These altered brain networks are closely associated with emotion, cognition, memory, sensation, movement, etc. We believe that strokes can affect these networks and cause emotional, sensory, motor and other dysfunctions in patients. In addition, the brain responses of different subgroups were not identical and showed different characteristics. For instance, wide inactivation in the limbic system (i.e., insular, ACC, thalamus, and PHP) in the frontal lobe subgroup was apparent, whilst the parietal lobe subgroup showed limbic system over-activation. The main reason for this difference may be that the parietal lobe is predominantly involved in sensory, taste and logical functions , and is not closely related to the limbic system. In contrast, the prefrontal cortex is closely related to the limbic system, with numerous axons connecting each other. Prefrontal cortex and limbic systems are involved in higher brain functions such as emotion and cognition . Frontal stroke causes disruption of nerve connections and decreased transmission of information, resulting in decreased activity of the limbic system. Different brain network reactions can cause different prognosis of stroke patients, the nature of which deserves further attention. \n\n\n### Similar emotional network of PSD \n  \nUsing structural and functional MRI data from the subjects, we showed that brain areas located in the prefrontal lobe, thalamus, PCC, angular gyrus, and cerebellum had decreased DC values in the three subgroups. Additionally, the temporal lobe, PHP, insular, ACC, and SMA had increased DC values in these subgroups. These results suggest that strokes of different lesion locations have similar brain networks. \n\n#### Negative brain network \n  \nThe DLPFC, thalamus, HP, and PCC belong to the limbic system. The limbic system supports a variety of functions including emotion, behavior, motivation and memory . Emotional life is largely housed in the limbic system which is the site of generation and conduction of emotional information . The decreased DC values of the limbic system may affect emotional information processing, which plays a role in PSD. As the functional connection of the limbic system reduces, the whole network is left in a restrained state, which affects other functions of the brain network. \n\nThe prefrontal lobe is well known to have a wide range of neural connections and complex structural schemas, as well as rich and complex axonal linkages, which are involved in the processing of emotional information . Decreased DC values of the prefrontal lobe would lead to a reduction in the neural association between the prefrontal lobe and other brain regions, thereby reducing the transmission of emotional information. In addition, the left prefrontal cortex is closely related to the reward system, which can promote the secretion of dopamine . The decreased DC values of the left prefrontal cortex may reduce the frequency of the reward mechanism function, and aggravate the negative state of stroke patients. \n\nThe thalamus is an important part of the limbic system, which is associated with changes in emotional reactivity . In emotional conduction, the thalamus shares a nerve connection with multiple brain areas. For example, the medial dorsal nucleus makes connections with cortical zones of the prefrontal lobe . Also, the anterior nuclei connect with the mammillary bodies, and through them (via fornix), with the HP and the CC . Based on these phenomena, some researchers believe that the thalamus is the relay station of emotional conduction. In our study, the thalamus showed a decreased DC value, which would result in reduced nerve conduction among the prefrontal lobe, HP, CC and thalamus. Moreover, some studies have shown that the frontal lobe and thalamus together constitute the awareness system, which is the main center of spiritual activity (32). Decreased functional connectivity in both brain regions may affect the awareness system, and is a possible reason for the slow-thinking symptom of PSD. \n\nMost researchers believe that the HP is associated with recent memory, and involved in emotional reactions and control . Decreased DC values of the HP would affect these emotional functions, and may be the reason that PSD patients are restless and easily angered. Likewise, the decreased memory function of HP also causes memory impairment in PSD patients. The PCC has been strongly linked to emotional salience. Our study showed that the PCC of both sides had decreased DC values; PCC abnormalities may be associated with the negative memory of depressed patients, which is thought to be related to emotional burden. \n\nThe prefrontal lobe, PCC, HP and angular gyrus belong to the default mode network (DMN). The DMN has two apparently opposite functions: a spontaneous cognition function and the function of monitoring the environment (sentinel hypothesis) . Our results suggest that PSD may significantly inhibit the functional activities of the DMN, and thereby weaken both of these functions. In addition, PSD may reduce self-evaluation and alerts to environmental awareness, eventually leading to lower episodic memory and alertness, all of which play an important role in the PSD network. \n\n\n#### Positive brain network \n  \nIn the present study, some brain areas including the temporal lobe, PHP, insular, and ACC showed increased DC values, in contrast to previous experiments . The insular is believed to be involved in consciousness, and plays a role in diverse functions usually linked to emotion . The anterior insular cortex is thought to be responsible for emotional feelings, and processes a person\u2019s sense of disgust in society. The increased DC values of the insular may aggravate the disgust symptoms of PSD patients. Moreover, as the insular and ACC are important nodes of the pain network , their excessive activation may also explain why many PSD patients suffer pain in the recovery period. \n\nThe ACC is involved in higher-level functions such as decision-making, impulse control, and emotion . Excessive activation of the ACC has been linked to the transmission of negative emotions. Other studies suggest that the temporal lobe controls the emotion response; if the temporal lobe appears negative during activation, the mood of the patient will stabilize . In our study, the temporal lobe showed increased DC values, which may explain the irritability observed in PSD patients. \n\nBriefly, the similar emotional network consists of a positive and a negative network. The positive network is associated with the generation of the emotion of disgust, negative emotional transmission, and stimulation of a pain sensation, and includes the temporal lobe, PHP, insular, ACC, etc. The negative network is mainly linked to decreased functional connection, emotional network and alertness inhibition, the generation of negative emotions, and awareness system inhibition, and includes brain areas in the limbic system and the DMN. The similar emotional network may be the common neurophysiological basis of PSD. \n\n\n\n### Individual emotional network of PSD \n  \nOur experimental results indicate that each subgroup has its own characteristics. In the temporal lobe subgroup, the right thalamus had increased DC values. The temporal lobe is involved in emotional processes, and is responsible for recognizing familiar facial emotions and interpreting emotions through someone\u2019s body posture. Evidence suggests that the temporal lobe may also be involved in precipitating emotional empathy . Damage to this area can result in problems with memory, understanding language, and maintaining emotional control. Extensive damage to the temporal lobe caused by stroke leads to emotional control reduction of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere , and an increase in unstable negative nerve impulses. The thalamus is the relay station of emotional conduction, and is directly connected with the temporal lobe. Stroke injury causes the ipsilateral thalamus to transmit more negative emotions, leading to enhanced thalamus activation. \n\nIn the frontal lobe subgroup, the left DLPFC and caudate showed increased DC values which were different from the other subgroups. Based on the mechanism of plasticity , the brain will form compensatory areas in the contralateral hemisphere. As a consequence of damage to ipsilateral brain function, DLPFC (as an important node of the limbic system and DMN) needs to transmit a high level of negative emotional information. Thus, more neurons are required for transmission in contralateral compensatory brain areas, which eventually leads to enhanced compensatory brain area activation. In addition, the compensatory activation of the DLPFC may cause activation of dopamine-related brain areas such as caudate, probably due to the close association between LPFC and the dopamine secretion mechanism . \n\nIn the parietal lobe subgroup, the frontal lobe showed substantially larger areas of decreased DC values than the other two subgroups. The parietal lobe integrates sensory information among various modalities, including spatial sense and navigation, and is responsible for brain information integration . Extensive activation of the prefrontal cortex may be due to the confusion within the integrated system of the damaged parietal lobe. \n\nIn brief, each subgroup possessed its own characteristics in terms of lesion locations. Four factors contributive to this observation: the neurological function of the stroke site, the compensatory mechanism of the brain, the mechanism of integrity and the locality of the brain. \n\n\n### Study limitations \n  \nAlthough the subjects were divided into three subgroups and heterogeneity reduced, more lesion locations need to be assessed to improve the reliability of the conclusions. Furthermore, the brain network of PSD of different generations, durations, and lesion sizes require analysis. The sample size in this study was relatively small, and future experiments should recruit more participants to achieve robust conclusions. Moreover, DC measurments require a threshold (r\u2009>\u20090.25), which represents a shortcoming of our experimental method. Thus, we plan to use more advanced methodology in future studies, including participation coefficient and eigenvector centrality. Furthermore, multimodal brain imaging (i.e., diffusion tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry) is useful for studying gray matter density and anatomical connectivity of the PSD brain, and will be employed in future experiments. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe hemodynamic response of PSD indicates that PSD has activities of similar emotional networks, of which the negative network realizes its function through the limbic system and DMN. The brain network has unique characteristics for different lesion locations. The neurological function of the lesion location, the compensatory mechanism of the brain, and the mechanism of integrity and locality of the brain are the important factors in the individual emotional network. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nGroup, no.

This pilot study of twelve subjects with chronic tinnitus investigates the relationship between measures of both task-based and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and measures of tinnitus severity, assessed with the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). MRI was measured at three time points: before, after, and at follow-up of an 8-week long mindfulness-based cognitive therapy intervention. During the task-based fMRI with affective sounds, no significant changes were observed between sessions, nor was the activation to emotionally salient compared to neutral stimuli significantly predictive of TFI. Significant results were found using resting state fMRI. There were significant decreases in functional connectivity among the default mode network, cingulo-opercular network, and amygdala across the intervention, but no differences were seen in connectivity with seeds in the dorsal attention network (DAN) or fronto-parietal network and the rest of the brain. Further, only resting state connectivity between the brain and the amygdala, DAN, and fronto-parietal network significantly predicted TFI. These results point to a mostly differentiated landscape of functional brain measures related to tinnitus severity on one hand and mindfulness-based therapy on the other. However, overlapping results of decreased amygdala connectivity with parietal areas and the negative correlation between amygdala-parietal connectivity and TFI is suggestive of a brain imaging marker of successful treatment. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSubjective tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of an external source, is a currently incurable chronic condition with a relatively large prevalence rate (12\u201330% of the general population) ( ). Tinnitus is a heterogeneous condition with varying perceptual qualities (e.g., pitch, loudness, type of sound) as well as varying psychological reactions to the condition. Most individuals habituate to the condition over time, but for a subset of people, the condition becomes debilitating with severe psychological effects including comorbid anxiety and depression ( ;  ). \n\nThe pursuit of better understanding and treating the condition typically falls into two overlapping lines of research. One area seeks to understand and intervene on the primary perception of the sound. The other line of research focuses more on understanding the reasons for the variability in psychological severity of the condition and pursuing ways to effectively encourage habituation and management of the perception. \n\nRecently, mindfulness-based therapies have been introduced as a treatment option in this second category of research to reduce the psychological burden of the condition. Although the research on these treatments are still in their early days, mindfulness-based therapies have shown initial promise in modulating the severity of tinnitus ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). These therapies teach a conception of mindfulness defined by   as \u2018paying attention\u2026on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.\u2019 \n\nAs mindfulness-based therapies have grown in popularity and have shown efficacy in a number of psychological conditions (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ), there has been a growing body of literature investigating changes in functional brain activity after a period of mindfulness training. Research on the functional correlates of tinnitus has also expanded in recent years, with evidence pointing to differences in both responses to certain types of tasks as well as resting state functional activity predictive of the condition. Given the evidence for functional changes with tinnitus and functional changes due to mindfulness training, there has been growing interest in testing the hypothesis that the positive effects from mindfulness interventions on tinnitus severity are modulated through changes in brain function ( ). Previous work on functional connectivity changes with tinnitus have suggested that therapies which increase connectivity with limbic regions and attention resting state networks could be effective at reducing tinnitus-related distress ( ,  ). Since mindfulness-based interventions have observed this pattern of connectivity change ( ), there is a strong theoretical basis to expect that mindfulness-based therapies may be effective through this mechanism. In this study, it was hypothesized that mindfulness-based therapies alleviate symptoms of tinnitus by altering those functional patterns. \n\nIn addition to changes in seed-voxel connectivity, supplemental tools from network analysis are widely used to understand anatomical and functional brain connectivity patterns using data obtained from neuroimaging studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Various network metrics have been used to assess and differentiate between individuals in terms of cognitive abilities and disease progression in a wide range of conditions ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Researchers have also observed many salient properties of brain functional networks, e.g., community (module) structure, rich club organization, network hub structure, strong local clustering, short characteristic path length, etc., which together lead to efficiency and small world property in networks. These network properties, in turn, have been associated with efficient performance of brain\u2019s tasks. A number of studies have also applied graph analysis tools to data from mindfulness or meditation studies and have found significant differences in efficiency and clustering coefficient in functional brain networks to be associated with meditation ( ;  ). However, these graph analysis tools have not been applied with respect to changes in tinnitus outcomes across mindfulness-based interventions. \n\nIn the current pilot study, we build upon results presented in   showing a reduction in tinnitus severity after a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention by analyzing the functional MRI (fMRI) data in the same subjects. We analyzed changes in brain activity during an auditory emotion task and during resting state across three sessions before, immediately after treatment, and 8 weeks after the treatment ended. The auditory emotion task was used in previous studies ( ) to differentiate between bothersome and mild tinnitus. As a secondary goal, we investigated whether changes in functional activity to the auditory emotion task or resting state across the sessions predicted the reductions in tinnitus severity, as assessed through the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI:  ). Finally, we investigated how network properties change across the mindfulness intervention and if those changes reflect tinnitus severity. This study adds to the burgeoning literature on functional brain differences in effective tinnitus therapies and will deepen our knowledge of this complex and heterogeneous condition. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \n#### Inclusion/Exclusions Criteria \n  \nParticipants underwent a screening session to determine eligibility before enrolling in the study. Individuals included in the study were between the ages of 21 and 72, had a Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI:  ) score of 28 or greater and had pure-tone thresholds less than or equal to 30 dB HL up to 2 kHz testing frequency in order to ensure that they were able to hear the MBCT instructors. The goal of recruitment was to include a broad sample of individuals with chronic, bothersome tinnitus, while excluding comorbid symptoms that may too drastically increase the heterogeneity of the tinnitus condition investigated in the study or otherwise impair the ability of the subject to participate in the study. These included transmandibular joint problems, a history of Meniere\u2019s disease, pulsatile tinnitus, drug and/or alcohol abuse in the recent past, a score greater than 25 on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI:  ), a score greater than 30 on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI:  ) or a score greater than 0 on question 9 of the BDI, which asks about suicidal ideation, neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), a history of or currently unmanaged post-traumatic stress disorder, unmanaged chronic health problems (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), a score of 23 or below on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE:  ), or speech discrimination scores in quiet lower than 80% in the better ear. \n\n\n#### Sample Demographics \n  \nTwenty-one participants (11 female) with problematic tinnitus were recruited from the Champaign\u2013Urbana area via fliers, campus notifications, and newspaper advertisements. The study was approved by the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign Institutional Review Board (IRB Protocol Number: 16784), and all subjects gave written informed consent prior to taking part in each phase (audiological, MRI, intervention) of the study. \n\nOf those 21 participants, 12 participants participated in the initial MRI scanning session, 10 participants remained for the post-MBCT session, and 8 participants returned for a follow-up scan 8 weeks after the conclusion of the study. Demographics for the 12 imaged participants are included in  .   shows the extended demographics for the post-MBCT and follow-up sessions. \n  \nSample demographics. \n  \n\n\n### Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy \n  \nParticipants were enrolled in one of two 8-week MBCT sessions. The classes were taught by clinical psychology graduate students trained in delivery of MBCT and supervised by a licensed clinical psychologist. Classes were structured according to the MBCT curriculum developed by   and used the student workbook developed for MBCT by  . Each class lasted about 2 h and involved learning about mindfulness, participating in exercises designed to illustrate principles of mindfulness, clarifying values and setting goals, and practicing techniques designed to cultivate mindfulness. After each class, home practice assignments were given according to the workbook, and participants were asked to commit to daily practice between 40 and 60 min. The classes were modified from the original curriculum to remove discussions of depression relapse prevention and include a loving-kindness meditation in the final class, but no tinnitus-specific exercises or discussions were introduced. \n\n\n### Behavioral Measures \n  \n#### Audiology \n  \nParticipants received a complete audiological evaluation during an initial screening phase, as well as pre-intervention (week 0), post-intervention (week 8) and at an 8-week follow-up session. The full audiological screening and follow-up audiology assessments were reported in  . \n\nThe initial audiological screening included pure-tone audiometry (0.25\u201316 kHz) (Equinox 2.0 PC-based clinical audiometer) and is presented in   with the sample demographics. \n\n\n#### Questionnaires \n  \nThree measures of tinnitus-related handicap were given at each session including the THI, TFI and Tinnitus Primary Function Questionnaire (TPFQ:  ). TFI, which has been shown to be sensitive to changes due to previous interventions ( ), was chosen to be analyzed as a covariate of interest with functional MRI changes. \n\nIn addition to the tinnitus measures, the participants were given the MMSE, BDI, BAI, Big Five Personality Test ( ), and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ:  ). TFI, BDI, and BAI were given at each of three MRI sessions. The behavioral data for this study was previously analyzed and reported in   and provided evidence for significant improvement in self-reported tinnitus severity. The focus of this study was to examine the change in functional MRI measures across the MBCT intervention and to analyze the relationship between brain function and tinnitus severity as the variables change over the course of the study. Since our sample was so limited in this pilot study, we chose to focus on TFI as the primary measure of tinnitus severity. \n\n\n\n### fMRI Scans \n  \nTwo fMRI scans were used to acquire measures of brain function at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up sessions. First, a resting state scan was collected over approximately 10 min. During the resting state scans, participants were instructed to lay still and fixate on a cross for the duration of the scan. This task was used to analyze resting-state functional connectivity, and the change in connectivity across sessions. \n\nThe second scan was an affective sound categorization task, where participants were asked to rate sounds presented to them as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. Sounds were used from the International Affective Digital Sounds Database (IADS;  ), which include normative scores of valences (1 very unpleasant \u2013 9 very pleasant) and arousals (1 low arousing \u2013 9 high arousing). Only the normative valence score was used to categorize sounds into emotionally salient, including a total of 46 pleasant sounds (valence: 6.89 \u00b1 0.25; arousal: 5.99 \u00b1 0.27) and 46 unpleasant sounds (valence: 2.66 \u00b1 0.38; arousal 6.95 \u00b1 0.31), and emotionally neutral, including 46 neutral sounds (valence: 4.96 \u00b1 0.36; arousal 4.92 \u00b1 0.29), for analysis. At each session, a different combination of 46 sounds was played, matched for valence across sessions. Each sound in a session was played twice, totaling 92 sounds played per session. The full list and order of the sounds presented in each session is included in  . Sounds were delivered using Presentation software  on a Windows 7 machine, with an Avotec silent scan 3300 sound system  through sound dampening headphones. \n\n\n### MRI/fMRI Acquisition \n  \nMRI data were collected on a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma MRI scanner with a 20-channel Siemens head coil. \n\nAn EPI sequence was collected during the resting state scan with parameters: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 25 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, 38 slices, 2.5 mm \u00d7 2.5 mm \u00d7 3.0 mm, FOV = 230 mm \u00d7 230 mm, matrix size = 92 \u00d7 92, with 304 volumes. \n\nA second EPI sequence was collected during the auditory emotion task using a sparse sampling design in order to allow enough time for the auditory stimuli to evoke a BOLD response that does not overlap with the auditory response to the scanner gradients. The sequence had parameters: TR = 9000 ms (7000 ms delay), TE = 25 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, 38 slices, voxel size = 2.5 mm \u00d7 2.5 mm \u00d7 3.0 mm, FOV = 230 \u00d7 230, matrix size = 92 \u00d7 92, 92 volumes. \n\nIn addition, a low-resolution T2-weighted structural image (TR = 3400 ms, TE = 65.0 ms, flip angle = 120\u00b0, 38 slices, voxel size = 1.2 mm \u00d7 1.2 mm \u00d7 3.0 mm, FOV = 230 \u00d7 230, matrix size = 192 \u00d7 192) and a high-resolution T1-weighted MPRAGE (TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.32 ms, flip angle = 8\u00b0, 192 slices, voxel size = 0.9 mm \u00d7 0.9 mm \u00d7 0.9 mm, FOV = 230 \u00d7 230, matrix size = 256 \u00d7 256) were collected and used for co-registration. \n\n\n### fMRI Analysis \n  \nTwo types of functional imaging analyses were conducted. First, results from the emotion task were analyzed. In the emotion task, the whole brain response to emotionally salient contrasted against emotionally neutral stimuli was analyzed for change throughout the intervention. Then, results from resting state data across the three intervention imaging sessions were analyzed. For the resting state data, the connectivity between the brain and several seed regions was analyzed for change throughout the intervention was analyzed, as well as how patterns of connectivity predicted TFI. In addition, how some graph measures of connectivity including modularity and efficiency changed across the sessions in the intervention was analyzed. \n\n#### Affective Sound Categorization Task \n  \nFunctional MRI data collected during the affective sound categorization task was analyzed using SPM12 software (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Welcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging ). Images were preprocessed in a five-step procedure including slice timing correction, realignment, coregistration, normalization, and smoothing (Gaussian kernel of 8 mm \u00d7 8 mm \u00d7 8 mm). \n\nIn the first level analysis, emotionally salient vs. neutral contrast images were generated for each subject for each session. Second level analysis analyzed sample-wide within session salient vs. neutral contrasts and contrasts between each of the session pairs using a paired   t  -tests. Cluster-level significance in the salient vs. neutral contrasts was assessed using a cluster-defining height threshold of   p   < 1e-5 and family-wise error (FWE)-corrected (  p   < 0.05) cluster extent defined by the SPM12 software through random field theory. Results found by reducing the height threshold to a more liberal   p   < 1e-4 are additionally cautiously presented. \n\n\n#### Resting State Functional Connectivity \n  \nFunctional MRI data collected during the resting state task was also analyzed using SPM12 software. Images were preprocessed using the same five-step procedure described above, but with some additional denoising steps implemented with the Functional Connectivity Toolbox (Conn)  ( ) for MATLAB. These denoising steps included filtering the fMRI data with a 0.008\u20130.08 kHz bandpass filter and regressing out the signal from the white matter and cerebrospinal fluid segmentations from SPM12. \n\nAfter denoising, seed-to-voxel connectivity analysis was conducted across several seeds of interest. Certain seed locations representing the default mode network (DMN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN) were the same as those used in earlier studies in our lab for comparison ( ). In similar fashion to the study conducted by   the DAN was split into two separate networks. The DMN used 8-mm spherical seeds corresponding to the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. The DAN_1 network used 8-mm spherical seeds corresponding to the left and right posterior intraparietal sulci. The DAN_2 network used 8-mm spherical seeds corresponding to the left and right frontal eye fields. Additionally, a seed representing the bilateral amygdalae was used given the evidence for its role in tinnitus ( ;  ). This seed was generated using the left and right amygdala parcellations in the atlas provided within the Conn toolbox, from the Harvard-Oxford subcortical atlas. For each of these regions, the seeds were combined prior to the connectivity analysis. \n\nIn addition to these networks, some network connectivity was investigated in an attempt to replicate and expand on results reported by  , which investigated changes in functional connectivity in the fronto-parietal (FPN) and cingulo-opercular networks (CON). As analyzed by  , seeds for these networks were separated by hemisphere. Seeds representing the left and right FPN in the left and right prefrontal cortex and representing left and right CON in the left and right anterior insulae were taken from the canonical network atlas provided in the Conn toolbox. The seeds and their coordinates in MNI space for each connectivity analysis are provided in  . \n  \nSeeds for seed-voxel connectivity analysis. \n  \nCluster-level significance in seed-to-voxel connectivity was assessed using a height threshold of   p   < 1e-5, and FWE-corrected cluster extent defined by the SPM12 software through random field theory. Results found by reducing the height threshold to a more liberal   p   < 1e-4 are additionally cautiously presented. \n\n\n#### Relationship With TFI \n  \nGeneralized estimating equations (GEE) were used to estimate the extent to which TFI predicted brain function across the intervention. For both the affective sound categorization task and the resting state functional connectivity, TFI was used as a predictor at each voxel to predict the results from the first-level, within-subject contrasts in a multi-scale adaptive generalized estimating equations (MAGEE) model developed by  . \n\nMAGEE integrates the GEE approach with adaptive smoothing methods to make robust estimates of betas for each voxel. GEE models account for the within-subject correlation among the longitudinal measures through the specification of a correlation structure to estimate parameters, avoiding violations of the sphericity assumptions in analysis of variance (ANOVA) and violations of the assumption of equal observations per time point in multivariate ANOVA. GEE can thus use incomplete data under less stringent assumptions while accommodating time-varying covariates without assumptions about the structure of the covariance, improving the power of the analysis for longitudinal data ( ). \n\nThe multi-scale adaptive smoothing smooths over the beta estimates across a user set number of iterations (in this case 5), allowing for a balance between cluster size and peak intensities. The beta for the TFI predictor was tested against the null hypothesis that beta = 0. The MAGEE analysis outputs a map of the Wald statistic for that parameter estimate, which is compared against a chi-squared distribution with 1-degree of freedom. Cluster-level analysis was completed using the peak_nii toolbox . Because of the increased power afforded by GEE, cluster-level significance was defined using a height threshold of   p   < 1e-5 and a cluster extent of 100. This height threshold and cluster extent were chosen cautiously to in order to restrict our analysis to relatively large and extended effects. However, results found by reducing the height threshold to a more liberal   p   < 1e-4 are additionally cautiously discussed. All statistical maps are presented after surface-mapping volumetric results using Connectome Workbench  ( ). \n\n\n#### Graph Analysis \n  \nTo obtain a whole-brain functional network from the resting state fMRI data, first, the mean region of interest (ROI) time series were obtained by averaging the fMRI time series over all voxels within an ROI. For this purpose, 90 cortical and subcortical ROIs (excluding the ones from the cerebellum and vermis regions) defined in the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas ( ) were chosen. Then a 90 \u00d7 90 pairwise correlation matrix was obtained using the time series from these 90 regions. The pairwise correlation matrix was thresholded at various target connection densities to convert it to an undirected and unweighted (binary) connection matrix. In each case, correlations whose absolute values were higher than the threshold were converted to 1 s and the remaining correlations were converted to 0 s. At low graph connection densities, only the strongest correlations are present in the graph as connections, and as the graph density increases, weaker correlations also get added to the graph. As is standard in the literature, there is no   a priori   preference for a target connection density and so graph properties at a number of such connection densities were investigated. \n\n##### Static network analysis \n  \nFirst, a single static network for each subject was created using the resting state time series data from the whole imaging session. With these static networks, the subjects\u2019 brain networks at pre, post, and follow-up sessions were compared both at the whole network level as well as at ROI level. Since data at all three sessions were available for only eight subjects, the remaining subjects\u2019 data were excluded from this analysis. The subjects\u2019 brain networks at pre, post and follow-up sessions were analyzed in terms of three commonly employed global graph summary measures, modularity, global network efficiency, and global clustering coefficient, and also tested for association of changes in these measures with changes in TFI scores between consecutive sessions. \n\nModularity is a quality function that measures how much the networks are modular, i.e., segregated into communities or modules as opposed to what one might expect from a random network with similar node degree patterns. The Newman\u2013Girvan modularity is computed using the Louvain algorithm for community detection ( ). The global network efficiency is defined as the average of the inverse shortest paths between pairs of vertices in the entire network ( ). The smaller the shortest paths are between pairs of vertices in the network, the higher the global efficiency. Intuitively, shorter paths between pairs of vertices allow information to pass throughout the network more efficiently. More locally, the nodal network efficiency of node   i   is defined as the average of the inverse shortest paths of all nodes in the network from the node   i  . Finally, the local clustering coefficient for a vertex measures the ratio of pairs of neighbors of the vertex   i   that are themselves connected (thus forming a closed triplet or triangle), to the number of such possible connections. The global clustering coefficient is defined as the average of the local clustering coefficient across the vertices of the network. The clustering coefficient is a measure of network segregation ( ), and a large clustering coefficient indicates that an otherwise sparse network is locally clustered and dense. For the purpose of statistical testing, due to the small sample size, non-parametric tests were employed along with parametric tests. All graph analyses were carried out in the statistical analysis software R. \n\nBeyond global summary measures, the subjects\u2019 brain network community structures between pre and post sessions were also compared by fitting the Random Effects Stochastic Block Model ( ) with the Co-regularized Orthogonal Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (Co-OSNTF) method ( ). The number of communities to be used with the Co-OSNTF method was obtained by taking the median of the number of communities detected in the subject networks separately using the Louvain method for community detection. The Co-OSNTF method was used to statistically test for differences in the global community structure as well as identify ROIs that have significantly different community placements between the two time sessions. Further, subjects\u2019 brain networks were compared at each ROI in terms of nodal efficiency and local clustering coefficient in an effort to identify the ROIs which exhibit differential properties. \n\n\n##### Dynamic network analysis \n  \nTime varying networks from the ROI time series data for each subject at each session were constructed using a sliding window approach ( ). A window size of 20 TRs (40 s) was moved by 1 TR to obtain 280 time windows. For each window, a correlation matrix is estimated from the data within that window. The absolute correlation was thresholded to obtain a sparse connection matrix with connection density of 0.10. The subjects\u2019 networks were then compared at pre and post intervention in terms of dynamic fluctuations of network efficiency, modularity and clustering coefficient. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nPaired   t  -tests showed that TFI scores were significantly lower at the post-intervention compared to pre-intervention sessions [  t  (9) = 4.97,   p   < 0.001] and significantly lower at the follow-up session compared to the pre-intervention session [  t  (7) = 4.67,   p   = 0.002]. However, there was no significant difference between the post-intervention and follow-up sessions [  t  (7) = 0.45,   p   = 0.66].   shows the mean and standard deviations of TFI scores at each session as well as the hours of logged weekly MBCT practice for each session. \n  \nTinnitus Function Index and mindfulness practice. \n  \nThere was a large variance in hours of practice of the 8-week period of intervention and the 8-week period following the treatment. Despite a numerical decline in mean practice hours, there was not a statistically significant difference between the amount of mindfulness practice logged during the MBCT and during the 8-week period after the MBCT ended [  t  (7) = 2.05,   p   = 0.08]. \n\n### Affective Sound Categorization Task \n  \nThere was little evidence for changes in functional activation during the affective sound categorization task across the three sessions of the study ( ). There were no statistically significant changes between sessions for the salient vs. neutral contrasts. \n\nAdditionally, there was no evidence for the activation differences between salient and neutral conditions predicting TFI in the participants ( ). \n\nHowever, results from the analysis at more liberal thresholds were also reported as possible points of follow-up for future studies, although these results should be interpreted with caution. Peak MNI coordinates and the direction of the relationship for each test are included in  . There was only some suggestive evidence, after reducing the statistical threshold, for a change in functional activation to the salient vs. neutral contrast between the post-intervention and follow-up sessions, where a decreased activation in clusters peaking in the left inferior frontal gyrus and the right insula were observed. Patterns of functional activation to the affective sound categorization task were not significantly predicted by TFI, even after reducing the statistical threshold. \n  \nResults from the analysis of the affective sound categorization fMRI. \n    \n\n### Resting State Functional Connectivity \n  \nFor the resting state analysis, we assessed how the seed-to-voxel whole brain connectivity changed across the MBCT intervention. We analyzed pre-determined seeds, meant to reflect the connectivity with the DMN, DAN_1 and DAN_2, AMYG, left and right FPN, and left and right CON. Significant results are reported in the main text, but for all of the networks, the full connectivity maps for each session, the full statistical maps of all non-significant between session changes, and the non-significant statistical maps of the connectivity associated with TFI are all presented in supplement ( \u2013 ). \n\n#### Default Mode Network \n  \nThe between-session comparisons revealed a pattern of decreased connectivity between the DMN and the right thalamus and occipital regions from pre-intervention to the follow-up session ( ). In contrast, there were connectivity increases between the DMN and clusters with peaks in the right angular gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus from the post-intervention session to the follow-up session ( ). There was some evidence that connectivity between the right middle frontal gyrus and the DMN and between the right putamen and the DMN was positively related with TFI, but there was no indication that connectivity with the DMN and these areas changed across the intervention ( ). \n  \nResults from the analysis of the DMN. \n      \nDMN connectivity changes between time points of the mindfulness intervention.   (A)   Connectivity between the DMN and clusters in the right thalamus and left calcarine sulcus significantly decreases from the pre-intervention session to the follow-up session.   (B)   Connectivity between the DMN and a cluster in the right angular gyrus significantly increases from the post-intervention session to the follow-up session. \n  \n\n#### Amygdala \n  \nThere was a significant decrease in connectivity between a cluster overlapping the left inferior parietal lobule and the amygdala from the pre-intervention session to the post-intervention session ( ). There was also evidence for the connectivity between the amygdala and multiple areas in the brain, mostly in frontal and parietal areas, relating positively to TFI ( ). The combined observations of the amygdala connectivity with parietal areas is intriguing. On one hand, the connectivity between these two regions significantly and positively predicts tinnitus severity. On the other hand, the connectivity between these regions significantly decreases over the intervention, suggesting that the decreasing connectivity may reflect some of the benefits of the MBCT.   completely summarizes the statistical tests for changes in each session and for connectivity associated with TFI. \n  \nResults from the analysis of the AMYG. \n      \nConnectivity with the amygdala from the pre-intervention session to the post-intervention session decreases in a cluster overlapping the left inferior parietal lobule. \n    \nSeed-voxel connectivity that significantly predicts TFI with the   (A)   AMYG,   (B)   DAN_1,   (C)   left FPN, and   (D)   right FPN. For each section, the left panel shows the Wald statistic, while the right panel indicates the beta value and the direction of the relationship. \n  \n\n#### Dorsal Attention Network \n  \nThere were no changes in connectivity with either of our DAN divisions in any of the pairwise session comparisons at the established threshold for significance. Even after reducing the voxel height threshold to be more liberal, no clusters emerged. Despite the lack of change in connectivity over the intervention, there were several clusters where the connectivity with DAN_1 significantly correlated with TFI ( ), primarily in the medial temporal lobe and cerebellum ( ). \n  \nResults from the analysis of the DAN. \n    \nIn contrast with DAN_1, no connectivity with DAN_2 significantly predicted TFI. However, by reducing the height threshold, two suggestive clusters appeared within inferior frontal and superior occipital regions ( ). \n\n\n#### Fronto-Parietal Network \n  \nThere were no changes in connectivity with the left FPN in any of the pairwise session comparisons at the established threshold for significance, although there was some evidence for decreased connectivity between the right FPN and left caudate nucleus from pre- to post-intervention when reducing height threshold. Despite the lack of change in connectivity over the intervention, there were several clusters where the connectivity with the FPN significantly correlated with TFI ( ). These included lobule IX of the cerebellar hemisphere, the bilateral insulae, right hippocampus, right middle temporal gyrus, and the right inferior frontal gyrus ( ). In contrast, connectivity between the left FPN and the left calcarine sulcus was significantly negatively correlated with TFI ( ). \n  \nResults from the analysis of the left and right FPN. \n    \n\n#### Cingulo-Opercular Network \n  \nThe between-session comparisons revealed a pattern of decreased connectivity between the left CON and the left superior frontal gyrus from the post-intervention to the follow-up session ( ). However, there was no indication that connectivity with the CON changed across the intervention (from the pre-intervention to the post-intervention sessions) or was predicted by TFI ( ). \n  \nResults from the analysis of the left and right CON. \n      \nConnectivity between the left CON and the left superior frontal gyrus decreases from the post-intervention to the follow-up session. \n  \n\n#### Global Graph Properties \n  \n present the median modularity, global efficiency, and global clustering coefficient respectively, at pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up (weeks 0, 8, and 16), at various graph density thresholds or costs. From   it appears that the modularity of the brain networks decreases post-intervention as compared to pre-intervention, but returns closer to the previous level at the follow-up session. There are similar trends in global efficiency and global clustering coefficient. While global efficiency increases at the post-intervention session compared to pre-intervention, the measure returns close to the previous level at the follow-up session ( ). This phenomenon is even more pronounced with global clustering coefficient, which is substantially lower at the post-intervention compared to pre-intervention, but almost entirely returns to the previous levels at the follow-up session ( ). These observations largely hold across different brain network density or cost. Hence, at the post-intervention session, the subject networks tend to be less functionally segregated ( ) as evident with lower modularity and clustering coefficient, and more functionally integrated ( ) as evident by higher global efficiency. However, both these changes to the brain networks tend to return to pre-intervention levels by the follow-up session. \n  \nComparison of pre-intervention (week 0), post intervention (week 8) and follow up (week 16) session brain networks in terms of   (A)   Median modularity,   (B)   Median global efficiency, and   (C)   Median global clustering coefficient as a function of increasing network density, along with the   (D)   distribution of the TFI scores measured for subjects at those sessions. \n  \nRemarkably, the distribution of TFI scores show a similar phenomenon, where the scores drop substantially at the post-intervention compared to pre-intervention, but remain stationary at the post-intervention level when measured again during the follow-up session ( ). The distribution of TFI scores was calculated over all subjects for whom data were available at the respective stage of data collection. Based on these observations we hypothesized that the changes in TFI scores might be related to the changes in the brain network global summary measures. \n\nAs reported in  , the difference in TFI scores was found to be positively correlated with changes in both the measures of functional segregation (modularity and clustering coefficient) with the correlation being statistically significant [0.05 family-wise error rate (FWER), corrected for multiple comparisons] at lower graph densities of 0.05 and 0.10 (significant in all but one graph density without correction for multiple comparisons). Notably, the correlations between the change in functional segregation measures and change in TFI scores are stronger at lower graph densities. The association between the difference in TFI scores and global network efficiency was not significant at any graph density. Additional analysis of the global graph properties are provided in supplement, including normalizing measures of inter-session changes ( ), analyzing a regression model of changes in TFI using global graph measures as predictors ( ) and analyzing multiple density thresholds (  and  ). Furthermore, dynamic changes in efficiency, modularity and clustering are provided ( ), as well as their distribution smoothed by a kernel density estimator ( ). \n  \nCorrelation of TFI score differences with the differences in modularity and clustering coefficient. \n    \n\n#### Local Graph Properties \n  \nThe subjects\u2019 networks at pre- and post-intervention were compared in terms of nodal efficiency and local clustering coefficient at each of the 90 ROIs using two-sample   t  -tests. At a connection density of 0.10, two ROIs, the right middle frontal gyrus, orbital part (Frontal_Mid_Orb_R), and the right angular gyrus (Angular_R) were found to exhibit significantly different nodal efficiency with a false discovery rate (FDR) correction of 5% (the ROI Frontal_Mid_Orb_R was also significant at 5% FWER). One ROI, the right calcarine fissure (Calcarine_R), was found to exhibit a significantly different local clustering coefficient with an FDR correction of 5% (also significant at 5% FWER). \n\nAt a connection density of 0.20, no ROIs were found to exhibit any significantly different nodal efficiency with an FDR correction of 5%. However, two ROIs, the right medial superior frontal gyrus (Frontal_Sup_Medial_R), and the right middle occipital gyrus (Occipital_Mid_R), exhibited significantly different local clustering coefficients with an FDR correction of 5%. At pre-intervention, some ROIs were found to exhibit very low nodal efficiency, indicating a disconnect of those ROIs with the rest of the network. However, those ROIs exhibited nodal efficiency at par with other ROIs post intervention. \n\nNext, random effects stochastic block models (RESBM) were fitted using the Co-OSNTF method ( ) to pre- and post-intervention subject networks at 0.20 connection densities. The median number of communities at pre-intervention brain networks was 5 and at post-intervention was 4.9 and hence 5 was selected to be the number of communities to be used with Co-OSNTF. The putative group module structures obtained from this method represent the module structures of all the 10 subjects at pre- and post-sessions and are presented in  . The group module structures were found to be significantly different between pre- and post-intervention at the whole network level with   p   = 0.0086. However, no nodes were found to have significantly altered module membership at 5% FDR. \n\nRESBM was also fitted to the pre and post-networks at 0.10 connection density with the number of communities as 6. The group module structures were found to be significantly altered between pre- and post-intervention with   p   = 0.0033. In addition, two ROIs, the left middle occipital gyrus (Occipital_Mid_L) and right inferior occipital gyrus (Occipital_Inf_R), were found to exhibit significantly altered module memberships in post-intervention as compared to pre-intervention with a 5% FDR correction (both ROIs were also significant with 5% FWER correction). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, our focus was on explaining declines in tinnitus severity due to MBCT using task-based and resting-state fMRI. For the task-based fMRI, when the participants were processing affective sounds, we did not observe changes in the response of any of the brain regions at post-intervention or at follow-up. However, there were changes across the intervention in the resting state connectivity of a diverse set of regions, as well as evidence for certain patterns of functional connectivity relating to tinnitus handicap. Because we observed some overlap between changes across the intervention and a relationship to TFI, connectivity between the amygdala and parietal regions showed particular promise as an area involved in the improved tinnitus severity outcomes across the MBCT intervention. In contrast, connectivity with other ROIs that we investigated showed varying degrees of evidence for sensitivity to the intervention or as relating to TFI but lacked any overlap. This overlap is critical to interpreting the role of brain regions or connectivity benefiting from the intervention, since MBCT may induce functional brain changes that have no bearing on predicting tinnitus severity, and similarly, there may be functional patterns of brain activation that are predictive of tinnitus severity but are not influenced by the specific MBCT intervention. \n\nDespite the sparse evidence for the resting connectivity with particular ROIs relating to the beneficial effects of the MBCT intervention (besides connectivity with the amygdala), global measures of connectivity from graph analysis did seem to have some correspondence to the decrease in tinnitus severity over the course of the intervention. Particularly, measures of functional segregation, modularity, and cross-correlation coefficient, which decreased over the MBCT intervention predicted the decreases in TFI. \n\n### Changes in RSFC During MBCT \n  \nWe found evidence for changes in seed-to-voxel connectivity across the MBCT intervention in the DMN, AMYG, and left CON, but did not see evidence in the DAN or left or right FPN. \n\nInterestingly, in both the DMN and the CON, the strongest contrasts in connectivity appeared to involve the follow-up session. In the DMN, we observed significant decreases in connectivity with the left calcarine sulcus and right thalamus from pre-intervention to the follow-up session. We also observed increased connectivity with the right angular gyrus from the post-intervention session to the follow-up. There was weaker evidence for a decrease in connectivity with the left middle temporal gyrus over the intervention, but then an increase in connectivity in the same area from the post-intervention session to the follow-up, after the intervention had ended. It is notable that the most significant changes in connectivity with the DMN occurred in contrasts with the follow-up session, suggesting that the brain may continue adapting even after the intervention. Our data suggested that there is substantial variance in practice both during and after the treatment and that our participants as a group continued their practice even after the MBCT ended. \n\nOur work replicates other studies of mindfulness that have found decreases in connectivity between the DMN and regions involved in visual processing ( ). However, we did not see any evidence of increased connectivity across the intervention with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which has been identified in other studies ( ;  ) and has been implicated in improvement with other conditions (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder,  ). It should also be noted that although researchers have observed connectivity increases   within   the DMN (e.g.,  ), we chose to combine seeds in the posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, which limits our ability to study any within network effects. \n\nIn the CON (sometimes called the salience network), we did not observe any changes across the intervention, but did observe a decrease in connectivity between the left CON and the left dorsolateral frontal gyrus between the post-intervention and follow-up sessions. The CON has been implicated in mindfulness-based treatments primarily in its increased connectivity with self-referential regions, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and decreased connectivity with visual regions ( ;  ).   found some trending evidence for increased connectivity between the salience network and what they refer to as the left central executive network, which included the left dorsolateral frontal gyrus, after 2 weeks of daily 20-min attention to breath training. Based on this, it seems more probable that the decrease in connectivity between post-intervention and follow-up sessions represents a return to baseline levels of connectivity after the intervention, rather than continued adaptation from the intervention. However, interpretation of any of the contrasts with the follow-up session, without significant effects at other contrasts, is very difficult, and highlights the importance of continuing this work with larger studies. \n\nIn the amygdala, we observed decreased connectivity with the left inferior parietal lobule from pre- to the post-intervention sessions. Changes in amygdala connectivity from mindfulness-based training treatments have been observed but seem to vary depending on the sample. For example, connectivity between the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex decreased after a 3-day intensive mindfulness meditation intervention in a sample of stressed, unemployed adults ( ). In a study on generalized anxiety disorder,   found an increase in connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex over the course of an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention, which correlated with the change in anxiety.   also found increased effective connectivity during an angry-faces viewing task between the left amygdala and medial frontal gyrus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and lingual gyrus after a mindfulness-based exposure therapy on a sample of combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. However, that study did not find significant correlations between changes in amygdala connectivity and symptom improvement. \n\nFurther research is required to determine whether connectivity changes with the amygdala are altered in a similar way across mindfulness interventions in accordance to a consistent framework or if instead changes in connectivity are highly dependent on the condition of the sample. For example, it may be possible to interpret connectivity changes across a mindfulness intervention in terms of increased cognitive control over emotional or default-mode processing, consistent across many forms of emotional dysregulation. Both research on post-traumatic stress disorder and existing research on tinnitus hypothesize that increased cognitive control over self-referential processing leads to improved outcomes ( ;  ;  ). \n\nAlternatively, there may be large condition specific effects. For example, in tinnitus, perhaps the emotional interpretation of primary sensory information is a critical aspect of the condition and is highlighted through changes in amygdala connectivity with the inferior parietal lobule. Conditions where the emotional interpretation of one\u2019s social position is more critical may instead be highlighted through changes in amygdala connectivity with the cingulate cortex or prefrontal cortex. \n\nA broader review of the neural bases of both MBCT and the related mindfulness-based stress reduction ( ) revealed increased activity and gray matter volume in the prefrontal cortex, the cingular cortex, the insula and the hippocampus in both individuals with stress or anxiety and healthy participants. In contrast, the amygdala showed decreased response. A more recent systematic review of fMRI studies of mindfulness-based interventions ( ) did not find compelling evidence of increased response in the prefrontal cortex; rather, the authors found significant increased insular cortex activity correlated with the longitudinal interventions. Again, the authors noted the variety of findings with respect to neural bases of mindfulness-based interventions dependent on the populations and tasks. \n\n\n### Predicting Changes in TFI Using RSFC \n  \nOne of the most striking results from this pilot study is the difference between functional connectivity that changes over a mindfulness intervention on one hand and functional connectivity that is predictive of tinnitus severity on the other. Connectivity between the FPN and broad regions of the brain predicted TFI, despite not showing any significant changes due to the intervention. Likewise, the DAN connectivity with a variety of regions, particularly limbic structures, predicted TFI, despite having no change due to MBCT. In contrast, connectivity to the DMN only weakly predicted TFI, and connectivity to the CON did not predict TFI. \n\nWe focused our analysis on resting state connectivity changes with regions that were implicated in both tinnitus and mindfulness-based treatments. Studies conducted on differences in functional connectivity in tinnitus compared to normal controls have identified changes in connectivity primarily in the DMN and networks involved in attention ( ,  ;  ). While the results of this study largely replicate the importance of these networks in tinnitus, there were some key differences. Primarily, differences in DMN connectivity that predicted tinnitus have focused on the decreased connectivity between DMN and the precuneus ( ,  ), whereas this study only found weak evidence for increases in connectivity between the DMN and the right middle frontal gyrus and putamen as predictive of TFI. In addition, while the results here replicate past results (e.g.,  ) showing increased connectivity between the attention networks and limbic regions, our study additionally implicates increased connectivity between attention networks and the cerebellum, inferior frontal areas, and occipital areas in predicting TFI. Although connectivity with the DAN and FPN have similar patterns in predicting tinnitus, connectivity between the FPN and the right middle temporal gyrus additionally predicted TFI, which was an absent effect in the DAN. Connectivity with the amygdala also predicted TFI, but the effects were focused primarily to increased connectivity with frontal and parietal regions. \n\nIt should also be noted that the study here investigates how a measure of tinnitus severity, TFI, within a sample of individuals with tinnitus, predicts functional connectivity. This contrasts with most of the previous research, which focuses on differences between individuals with tinnitus vs. normal-hearing controls. It may be the case that changes in DMN connectivity strongly differentiate tinnitus patients from controls, but are far less important in predicting severity, whereas connectivity with regions involved in attention and emotion plays a far greater role in predicting severity. \n\n\n### Functional Correlates of Successful MBCT \n  \nThus far, we discussed the mostly disparate results between changes in connectivity across the intervention and connectivity that predicts tinnitus severity. However, for the purpose of understanding any benefits of the intervention in terms of functional connectivity, we would like to observe changes in connectivity that also predicted TFI. This key overlap was evident in connectivity between the amygdala and parietal regions and in some of the global graph theoretical metrics of connectivity. \n\nThe cluster of amygdala connectivity with the parietal areas that changed over the intervention peaked in the left inferior parietal lobule, whereas amygdala connectivity with parietal areas that predicted TFI peaked in the left precuneus and left superior parietal lobule. Future research will be required to determine if these patterns of connectivity represent the same mechanism of some broad connectivity between the amygdala and the parietal lobe or if they represent two distinct patterns of connectivity. Interpreting the connectivity with parietal areas is further complicated by the complex functions of the parietal lobe. In fact, even within the precuneus, functions, and connections may vary widely between dorsal and ventral regions ( ;  ). Despite these difficulties, the observation is a promising lead for future research. A large region of decreased connectivity between the amygdala and the parietal lobe appears to overlap with regions where that change predicts tinnitus severity. This overlap represents the critical result from the functional connectivity analysis, since every other measure of functional connectivity that changes over the intervention did not show any relation to tinnitus severity. With such a small sample, this may simply be due to being underpowered, but it is intriguing to speculate about the specific role of amygdala-parietal connectivity in tinnitus. On the one hand, the connectivity could be interpreted in terms of emotional regulation through the control functions of the parietal lobe. However, previous research has shown   increased   connectivity between the amygdala and cognitive control networks in response to cognitive behavioral therapy ( ) and in mindfulness practice ( ). Therefore, we would predict that if it was an attentional effect, the change in connectivity and the relation to tinnitus severity would be in the opposite direction from what we observed. It is possible that the reduction in connectivity observed here instead reflects a reduced need to process self-referential information related to stress. Increased connectivity between amygdala and the precuneus has been seen in response to psychosocial stress ( ). In addition,   observed increased amygdala-precuneus connectivity related to neuroticism and speculated that aberrant self-referential information processing reflected in this connectivity difference, may increase the propensity toward negative emotions. Despite the decreasing overall connectivity between the amygdala and parietal areas, we did observe increasing local nodal efficiency over the intervention in frontal and parietal areas as well, which may represent increased efficiency of areas involved in cognitive control. More research is clearly needed to elucidate the meaning of these findings and more finely define the spatial effects. \n\nBesides these ROI based results, there were also global measures of connectivity that predicted the change in TFI. Specifically, decreases in measures of functional segregation (modularity and clustering coefficient) predicted decreases in TFI. Previous works have suggested meditation or mindfulness training to be associated with a decreased functional segregation and increased function integration in the brain networks ( ;  ). Our observations in this study are in line with those findings. While we found mindfulness training to be associated with both decreased segregation and increased integration, only the changes in the measures of segregation were found to be correlated with changes in TFI scores. Again, it is important to point out that this change in functional segregation speaks to a functional change within a sample of individuals with tinnitus and without a control it is impossible to relate to a non-tinnitus group. The relationship is particularly intriguing, since research on intervention-related plasticity typically has found modularity to positively predict behavioral outcomes across a variety of interventions (see   for a review). It is possible that in the context of tinnitus or other conditions of disordered emotional processing modularity represents a different mechanism or pattern of brain function. This intriguing possibility further emphasizes the need for future research with a non-tinnitus comparison group. \n\nPrior to this study, only one study has investigated the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention on the resting-state connectivity in tinnitus patients ( ). Unlike that study, we did not observe changes to the connections between the attention networks and other regions but did note differences between DMN seeds and other regions. Interestingly, we did not see evidence that either of these patterns of connectivity overlapped with regions predicting tinnitus severity over the course of the intervention. In their study, they did not explicitly examine changes in connectivity that were predicted by tinnitus severity. The difference in the intervention effects may have been due to the difference in protocols (MBCT vs. mindfulness-based stress reduction). However, it is also probable that the small sample sizes in both studies yielded less reliable results or were underpowered to observe the effects. \n\n\n### Limitations and Future Directions \n  \nDespite the promise of the analysis of the study in informing future directions in research on tinnitus interventions, this pilot-study has some great limitations. First, this was an open-label study, with the participants aware of the treatment they were receiving and no control group. The lack of a control group is somewhat offset by the longitudinal nature of the study; with the baseline longitudinal data on their self-report tinnitus measures, each participant served as their own control in some regards. However, it is difficult to definitively attribute the effects to the MBCT, and the results may be due to other factors not considered here, including placebo effects. \n\nA further major shortcoming of this study is the small sample size, further exacerbated by a high dropout rate. A small sample size is sometimes an unfortunate aspect of studies of medical conditions due to challenges in recruitment and retention. The current study did not include data from any participants that missed more than two classes, which may be too restrictive of a criterion for future research, especially if adherence to home practice is maintained. A second limitation of the small sample is the inability to model heterogenous aspects of the sample, including age. We have attempted to mitigate the small sample size by using statistical techniques that allow unequal sample sizes and focus on population-level effects (rather than within-subject effects) to improve the power of the fMRI analyses as much as possible. We also attempted to report the results in such a way that makes all of the results accessible rather than limiting the scope of the results to a single set criterion. However, due to the limited sample size, the results presented here should be taken as suggestive rather than definitive. \n\nWe plan to use findings from this pilot study to guide future research and theory building for tinnitus interventions. Mindfulness-based interventions appear to be a promising therapy for tinnitus and understanding why may open ways to enhance or substitute these effects. Randomized controlled clinical studies with larger sample sizes and control groups with and without tinnitus will help determine the answer to some of the questions that the research here brings up. First, increased power will help to make a stronger case for whether mindfulness-based therapies improve many conditions through a similar mechanism (e.g., improved attentional control over emotional processing) or whether there are unique, condition-specific effects that need to be considered while developing future interventions. Secondly, a non-tinnitus control group would be beneficial in further elucidating patterns of brain function that predict the condition of tinnitus itself and patterns of brain function that predict severity within the condition. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn this feasibility study, we measured fMRI at three time points: before, after, and at follow-up of an 8-week long MBCT intervention. In an affective sound categorization task, no significant functional activation differences were observed between sessions, nor was the activation to emotionally salient compared to neutral stimuli significantly predictive of TFI. However, we found significant changes in resting state connectivity with the DMN, cingulo-opercular network and amygdala after the intervention, and patterns of resting state connectivity with amygdala, DAN and frontoparietal network significantly predicted tinnitus-related handicap. Critically, the overlap of decreased amygdala connectivity with parietal areas and the negative correlation between amygdala-parietal connectivity and TFI is suggestive of a brain imaging marker of successful treatment of tinnitus-distress. Additionally, we found an intriguing pattern of decreased functional segregation predictive of decreased TFI over the course of the MBCT intervention. Our findings support the use of brain imaging, specifically resting state functional connectivity analyses, to provide clinicians and researchers with supplementary information to better evaluate the efficacy of interventions and to design more focused experiments in future. \n\n\n## Data Availability \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Institutional Review Board of the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, with written informed consent from all subjects.

Resting state functional MRI (fMRI) has been established as an important tool for mapping cerebral regional activity and phosphorous chemical shift imaging ( P CSI) has been applied to measure levels of energy phosphates and phospholipids non-invasively in order to gain insight into the possible etiology of affective disorders. This is an initial attempt to identify the existence of a correlation between regional energy phosphates and connectivity at nodes of the posterior default mode network (DMN). Resting state fMRI in conjunction with  P 2D CSI was applied to 11 healthy controls and 11 depressed patients at 3\u00a0T. We found that differences between the two groups exist in correlation of lateral posterior parietal cortex functional connectivity and regional Pi/PCr. Results of this study indicate that resting-state-fMRI-guided  P CSI can provide new insight into depression via regional energy phosphates and functional connectivity. \n   Highlights  \n  \nEnergy phosphates and functional connectivity are markers of physiological conditions.. \n  \nWe first apply rsfMRI &  P CSI to assess correlation between the two markers. \n  \nDistinctive correlations between them in normal controls and patients with depression \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMitochondrial dysfunction, including damage to the electron transport chain, has been suggested to be an important factor in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder (BPD), depression, and schizophrenia ( ;  ;  ). This implicates involvement of abnormal energetics in affective disorders, which can be quantified using  P MRS to measure brain levels of phospholipids and high-energy phosphates and gain insight into the status of these metabolites and possible mechanisms of the disorders ( ;  ). Much progress has been made in collecting   static   levels of the  P metabolites from participants while resting in the scanner in conjunction with regional segmented tissue composition ( ). Previous studies on skeletal muscle exercise have also demonstrated a close coupling between work output and regional energy phosphates and how normal and disease differed from each other in performance ( ;  ). This motivates effort to look into paradigms of  P MRS in conjunction with visual stimulation ( ) or medications even though applications of these paradigms have their own limitations. \n\nSpecifically, within physiological range, the changes in brain energy metabolites due to stimulation or tasks could be relatively small and regional as the brain is operating at nearly full capacity of its energy sources even at resting state ( ;  ). Furthermore, the long data acquisition time of  P MRS requires a lengthy stimulation or task, which could increase the probability of unwanted motion artifact. These issues motivated us to collect and examine energy phosphates that may be associated with resting state functional connectivity in patients with affective disorders. \n\nResting state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the human brain has received an enormous amount of attention in recent years for its involvement in the intrinsic operation of the brain. fMRI studies have found that the default mode network (DMN) is \u201cactivated\u201d during resting state but \u201cdeactivated\u201d while performing tasks ( ;  ;  ). This network has been associated with processes ranging from attention lapses to clinical disorders like anxiety ( ;  ;  ). With resting state functional MRI (fMRI), researchers have recently discovered significant abnormalities in altered spatial distribution and fluctuation frequencies of functional connectivity in the brain of people with affective disorders compared to healthy controls ( ;  ). Note that brain regions within the DMN have a correlated time course of fMRI signals. The higher the degree of the correlation, the higher the functional connectivity. \n\nP MRS can directly measure regional levels of ATP, PCr, Pi, and phospholipid metabolites with a spatial resolution of several cubic centimeters per voxel ( ). Phosphocreatine (PCr), glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria are the main energy sources that support brain function and activity. Net adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is generated from glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation via inorganic phosphate (Pi) and the PCr/creatine (Cr) energy reservoirs provide a buffering effect. The majority of brain ATP is synthesized via oxidative phosphorylation, the ATP source with endurance capacity. PCr and glycolysis, on the other hand, respond quickly to increases in ATP utilization due to enhanced neural activity ( ). When PCr responds to an increase in ATP utilization, the level of PCr decreases and the levels of Pi and the Pi/PCr ratio increase. During muscle exercise, higher Pi/PCr ratio is associated with higher work output. \n\nWe hypothesize that DMN connectivity may be associated with regional metabolic activity, which may involve metabolites such as GABA and regional energy phosphates. The former has recently been explored extensively ( ;  ;  ;  ) but the latter has not been studied, making the present approach the first to address this issue using MRS. We have recently investigated the feasibility of using  P MRS in conjunction with resting state fMRI in mapping regional energy phosphates associated with functional connectivity at the nodes of the posterior DMN. This report details the results of the preliminary study. \n\n\n## Materials & methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nUnder protocols approved by the McLean Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB), 11 depressed patients (5 males/6 females, age: 61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08, HAM-D\u00a0=\u00a021.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2, YMRS\u00a0=\u00a04.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7) ( ), two of them were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and nine with BPD depression, were recruited to participate in this study. Eleven age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (5m/6f, age: 56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08, HAM-D (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( ))\u00a0=\u00a00.6, YMRS (Young Mania Rating Scale ( ))\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8) served as healthy controls. All participants provided written informed consent before participating and had no MRI-related contraindications. All patients were currently on stable doses of medication and included the following: MDD patients were taking quetiapine, sertraline, trazodone and/or venlafaxine. All BPD patients were taking either a mood stabilizer (lithium and/or lamotrigine), an atypical antipsychotic (quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone, asenapine), SSRIs (sertraline, trazodone, fluoxetine) or other antidepressant (buproprion, imipramine). In addition, many patients were prescribed a variety of medications to treat hypertension, type 2 diabetes, GERD, thyroid disease, and/or high cholesterol. No participants were on medications or supplements, such as CoQ10, that may alter energy state. Among them, ten depressed patients and ten healthy controls (HC) completed both resting state fMRI and  P 2D chemical shift imaging (CSI) data collection. \n\n\n### Resting state fMRI data acquisition \n  \nThe resting state BOLD MR images were collected on a 3\u00a0T whole body MR scanner (TIM Trio, Siemens AG, Germany) using a 32-channel head array. During the resting state imaging, participants were instructed to lie still with their eyes open in low-level illumination without fixation for approximately 9\u00a0min. No cognitive tasks were performed before or during the MR study. The BOLD images were obtained with a T *- weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence. Acquisition parameters include TR/TE\u00a0=\u00a02200/30\u00a0ms, 4 dummy scans, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0, and field of view\u00a0=\u00a0224\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0224\u00a0mm  with a 64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064 acquisition matrix, yielding a voxel size of 3.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0mm . We acquired 35 contiguous axial functional slices of 3.5\u00a0mm thickness without a gap to cover the brain for 240 time points during the resting state fMRI data collection. The first 4 time points of the scan were not included in the data analysis to allow global image intensity to reach steady state. \n\n\n### P MRS data acquisition \n  \nThe  P 2D CSI was collected with a double-quadrature dual-tuned (proton/phosphorus,  H/ P) volume head coil (Clinical MR Solutions, LLC, Brookfield, WI, USA) on the same TIM Trio MR scanner used for the resting state fMRI data collection. After shimming to optimize static field homogeneity, a set of 2D  P CSI data was collected from a graphic prescribed 30-millimeter axial slice across the brain ( ) using a 2D phase-encoding gradient matrix of 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08 (weighted) and interpolated into 16\u00a0\u00d7\u00a016 in post-processing. To reduce possible mis-registration due to chemical shift difference, the  P CSI slice was excited using a 1.28-ms hyperbolic sinc pulse with its excitation bandwidth of 3.55\u00a0kHz. Other parameters included flip angle ~52\u00b0, TE\u00a0=\u00a02.3\u00a0ms, TR\u00a0=\u00a02.2\u00a0s, FOV\u00a0=\u00a0220, and 18 signal averages for a total data acquisition time (TA) of 6.5\u00a0min. \n\n\n### Resting state fMRI data analysis \n  \nPrior to analyzing functional connectivity, motion correction was first performed in 3D realignment with the 3dvolreg function of AFNI (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages,  ) and a temporal band-pass filter (0.008\u00a0Hz\u00a0<\u00a0f\u00a0<\u00a00.1\u00a0Hz) was applied to reduce low frequency drift and high frequency physiological noise. Linear regression was also applied to remove nuisance covariates of parameters of rigid body motion, signals from the white matter and ventricle region of interest, and signals from the whole brain mask. In order to better define the DMN node in the posterior cingulate/precuneus cortex (PCC) region in the patients, we used an independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm (MELODIC (Multivariate Exploratory Linear Decomposition into Independent Components) v4.0, one part of FSL (FMRIB's Software Library,  ) FMRIB Oxford University, UK ( )) to identify DMN components from 60 spatiotemporal independent components and the coordinates of the DMN node in the PCC region. \n\nA PCC seed was defined as a sphere with a radius of 10\u00a0mm centered at (0 69 18) ( ) and the PCC time series was calculated by averaging the time series of all voxels in the sphere. Correlation maps were generated for each participant by calculating the correlation coefficients, voxel-by-voxel, between the time course of the seed and the time courses of voxels in other brain regions. To test for significant connectivity changes in each participant, the correlation coefficients were converted to Z-scores by using Fisher's r-to-z transformation. For group-level correlation Z-map analysis, we computed a one-sample t-test to yielding a group-averaged Z-score map. \n\n\n### Correlation of regional activation activities with depression symptom severity \n  \nFor DMN nodes in the posterior cingulate (PCC) and bilateral posterior parietal cortex (LPPC and RPPC), regional Z-scores were extracted from the Z-score maps with a 10-mm ROI from the corresponding resting state active regions. Because the  P CSI slice in most of the participants did not cover the DMN regions in the frontal lobe, the data analytical strategy was focused in the DMN regions of the PCC and posterior parietal cortex (LPPC and RPPC). In addition, regional Z-scores were also extracted from the extra resting-state active regions of the posterior parietal/occipital lobes which only appeared in the depressed patients (LPPC  and RPPC ) with a 10-mm ROI ( ). Multiple regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between individual patients' DMN regional Z-scores (functional connectivity) and their symptom severity as assessed by HAM-D. The null hypothesis was tested for each variable of interest using the Student t-test. Statistical significance was defined at an alpha level of p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05, two tailed. \n\n\n### P MRS data processing \n  \nThe 2D CSI data were post-processed on a satellite console of the MR system for integrals of  P metabolite signals (Pi, PCr, \u03b3- and \u03b1-ATP) voxel-by-voxel. To avoid a relatively large chemical shift mis-registration of \u03b2-ATP due to its relatively large chemical shift, molecular ATP level (mATP) was calculated by averaging \u03b3- and \u03b1-ATP instead of all three components. To minimize the impact of RF B  inhomogeneity across the brain at  P frequency ( ), metabolic ratios Pi/PCr and Pi/ \u03b3ATP, instead of comparing absolute levels of the metabolites, were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis for comparison. We also examined normalized Pi (calculated as Pi/(Pi\u00a0+\u00a0PCr)) as well as normalized PCr (calculated as PCr/(Pi\u00a0+\u00a0PCr)) in regions of the DMN. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected from both-group-overlapped activation regions and depressed-only activation regions in the group correlation maps in the DMN regions of the parietal/occipital lobes ( ) based on brain anatomy landmark. The Pi/PCr and Pi/\u03b3ATP ratios were extracted from the CSI voxels at the anatomic locations corresponding the ROIs in the CSI maps superimposed on the anatomic image and the corresponding correlation maps. The Pi/PCr ratios were calculated based on weighting the voxel faction \u2211  v \u00a0\u2217\u00a0(Pi/PCr) , where v  is the voxel faction   i   and (Pi/PCr)  is the corresponding Pi/PCr ratio. Similar calculations were applied to the Pi/\u03b3ATP ratios. The ROI of PCC was a 4-voxel average for both patients and the healthy controls. The ROIs of the LPPC and RPPC were one voxel average, and those of the LPPC  and RPPC  were a 2-voxel average for both groups. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Functional connectivity \n  \nGroup correlation maps revealed that the resting state active area in the left and right posterior parietal cortex (LPPC and RPPC) of depressed patients was much larger than the area in the healthy controls ( a). Functional connectivity, as measured by group averaged Z-scores, of the healthy controls was noticeably lower than those of the patients in the PCC, LPPC, and RPPC regions ( ). The differences of the connectivity reached statistical significance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05) in the LPPC. More specifically, Z-scores of the healthy controls were 45% lower than that of the patients. The connectivity of the patients in the LPPC  and RPPC  regions was significantly higher than those of the controls in the same regions (L: +316%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004; R: +214%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0103) ( c). \n\n\n### P metabolites \n  \nThe group averaged Pi/PCr ratios of healthy controls were higher in all DMN regions in the PCC, LPPC, and RPPC ( b) as well as the LPPC  and RPPC  ( c), compared to those of patients, with the difference reaching statistical significance in the LPPC and LPPC  regions (+19% each in LPPC and LPPC , p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). The lower Pi/PCr in the depressed patients was most likely due to reduced Pi because the Pi/\u03b3ATP ratio was also significantly lower in the regions of the PCC, LPPC, and LPPC  while pH and PCr/mATP remained statistically similar in all DMN regions of both groups ( ). \n\n\n### Correlations \n  \nIn the PCC region, the functional connectivity was not significantly correlated with regional Pi/PCr ratios (p\u00a0=\u00a00.392) for both groups. In the LPPC and RPPC regions, the functional connectivity of the healthy controls was negatively correlated (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023) with the regional Pi/PCr ratios ( a) and its intercept on the Pi/PCr axis was 0.40 while those of the patient LPPC and RPPC were uncorrelated (p\u00a0=\u00a00.867). However, in the LPPC  and RPPC  regions, the functional connectivity of the patients was significantly and positively correlated with the regional Pi/PCr ratios ( b) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0166), with an intercept of 0.13 on the Pi/PCr axis. Similarly, normalized Pi (as calculated by Pi/(Pi\u00a0+\u00a0PCr)) was negatively correlated with regional connectivity of the LPPC and RPPC of the healthy controls and was positively correlated with the regional connectivity of the LPPC  and RPPC  of the patients. Normalized PCr was significantly lower in the LPPC  and RPPC  of the patients. However, there was no significant correlation between Pi/\u03b3ATP and functional connectivity in the PCC and regions of the left posterior parietal cortex for both groups. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe results of this preliminary study confirm that  P CSI can detect regional energy phosphates associated with DMN activity on a broadband clinical scanner and that these differences can be used to identify depressed patients from matched healthy controls. The major finding of this study is that the DMN of depressed patients was coherently and metabolically different from that of healthy controls. The difference appeared to be mainly in the bilateral posterior parietal cortex ( ) and was marked by the following key metrics: 1) higher resting state functional connectivity and lower Pi/\u03b3ATP and Pi/PCr metabolic ratios, and 2) a distinct correlation between regional Pi/PCr ratios and functional connectivity. \n\nThe differences in coherence originated with the larger recruitment and the higher connectivity in the DMN regions of the posterior parietal cortex, especially in the left posterior parietal cortex ( a, c), which has been found to be involved in a wide range of cognitive processes ranging from attention, memory, motor action and language to mathematical problem solving and social integration. Previous studies have shown that increased connectivity in parietal regions is associated with impaired emotional and cognitive processing such as deficits in attention, memory, and audiovisual emotional integration in depressed patients ( ;  ). Resting state hyperconnectivity and larger recruitment of correlated regions in the DMN in depressed patients have also been observed in patients with MDD and are linked to depressive ruminations ( ;  ;  ). Following treatment with antidepressant medications, the hyperconnectivity of the DMN was reduced in depressed patients ( ), which was associated with an improvement of their depressive symptoms. \n\nBy definition, hyperconnectivity represents a higher degree of coherence with the PCC seed region, which may or may not require a higher intensity of spontaneous BOLD MR signal. The Pi/PCr ratio is a quantity that links to ADP via equilibrium of creatine kinase reaction and a measure of phosphate energy stores compared to Pi. The ratio was shown to be a control factor in the work\u2013biochemical cost relationship of functioning tissue and in oxidative phosphorylation of skeletal muscle ( ;  ). The negative correlation between Pi/PCr and functional connectivity (Z-scores) in the RPPC and LPPC regions of healthy controls suggests that regional connectivity is limited by the concentration and distribution of energy phosphates. The intercept on the Pi/PCr axis of  a implies that if regional Pi/PCr reaches a level of 0.40 or beyond, then the regional resting-state connectivity would cease because all the available energy must be allocated to maintain the basic needs of the region. These data suggest that the regional DMN connectivity in the healthy controls does not rely on the regional PCr/Cr energy reservoir and is most likely supported by glycolysis and phosphorylation and was well regulated metabolically because during the resting state, oxygen and nutrition to the region via blood were at steady state and maintained regional protein synthesis and neural activity. The positive correlation in the RPPC and LPPC regions of the patients suggests that the connectivity in the LPPC and RPPC regions of the depressed brains most likely depends on the regional PCr/Cr reservoir, implicating a slower phosphorylation process in the regions. Future studies may offer more insight into the underlying mechanism that leads to the distinctive correlations of resting state functional connectivity and regional Pi/PCr between controls and depressed patients. \n\nA few technical issues must be considered when mapping energy phosphates. First,  P CSI is subjected to chemical shift misregistration artifacts similar to proton spectroscopic imaging. In the present study, we set the carrier frequency at the PCr resonance and the chemical shift difference between Pi and PCr is approximately 5\u00a0ppm (approximately 240\u00a0Hz) yields about 7% of voxel misregistration error. While this error is tolerable for the present study, a larger excitation bandwidth or shifting carrier frequency may be needed when mapping other metabolites such as \u03b2-ATP, which is \u221216.3\u00a0ppm away from PCr. Second, we used the Pi/PCr ratio instead of absolute concentrations of the metabolites to minimize possible errors due to inhomogeneity of B  distribution across the brain. Future studies targeting quantitative measure of metabolite distribution should also take into account the flip angle, TR, and T1s of the metabolites to avoid possible saturation. As the apparent T1 of PCr is longer than that of Pi in vivo at 3\u00a0T ( ), overestimation of Pi/PCr values may occur when the flip angle is too high for a given TR. In addition, improving detection sensitivity of  P MRS and increasing spatial resolution for  P CSI in the future will improve the measurement accuracy of the activity/energy state relationship. \n\nFinally, as with all studies of patients with a psychiatric disorder, medication effects must be considered. Obviously, unmedicated, depressed patients would have been ideal for a mechanism study, but such individuals are relatively rare, especially when older adults are included, and it would be unethical to ask a patient to delay starting their medication[s] in order to participate in this study, which targeted possible correlation between regional connectivity and energy metabolites. Instead, we elected to adopt inclusion/exclusion criteria that would admit only patients who were on stable doses of a limited number of antidepressants and mood stabilizers but not on supplements or medications that may alter the energy state. Regardless of the medication effect, patients still presented with depressive symptoms and elevated HAM-D scores. Thus, the present study demonstrates a proof of concept that resting state functional connectivity and regional energy phosphates were correlated using a multimodal imaging approach of  P MRS and  H fMRI. \n\nIn summary, we found an altered metabolic pattern in the default mode network of depressed patients compared to healthy controls. The depressed DMN nodes in the PCC and posterior parietal cortex displayed a hyper-connective state that was associated with lower Pi/PCr ratios compared to those of the controls. The connectivity of the LPPC and RPPC regions was distinctively correlated with the regional Pi/PCr ratio depending on the controls or the depressed patients, implicating a possible coupling between depressed behavior and regional energetic stress. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: t0005\n### Label: Table\u00a01\nGroup\tBPD/MDD\tHC\tp\nSex (m/f)\t5m/6f\t5m/6f\t\nAge (year)\t61.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.0\t56.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.4\tNS\nIllness duration (years)\t37.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.6\t\t\nHam-D\t21.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\t0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\t<0.01\nYMRS\t4.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7\t0.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\tNS\n### Caption\nDemographic and mood characteristics.\n### Footer\nNote: NS\u00a0=\u00a0not significant.\n\n\n## ID: t0010\n### Label: Table\u00a02\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tTable of ROI coordinates\tTable of ROI coordinates\tTable of ROI coordinates\nRegion\tx\ty\tz\nPCC\t45\t34\t50\nRPPC\t\u221245\t63\t24\nLPPC\t42\t72\t30\nRPPCD\t\u221242\t48\t27\nLPPCD\t42\t63\t24\n### Caption\nLocation of Z-scores that were extracted from a 10\u00a0mm radius sphere.\n### Footer\nNote: MPFC node of the DMN components was not included in this study because it did not overlap with the slice of the 31P 2D CSI in many participants.
