Although it has been proven that carotid artery stenting (CAS) can reduce the risk of future strokes, the effect of CAS on cognition is conflicting. In recent years, pulsed arterial spin labeling (pASL) MRI and resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) have been employed in cognitive impairment studies. For the present study, cognition is evaluated in severe asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients undergoing CAS, and the mechanisms underlying the cognitive change are explored by pASL MRI and R-fMRI. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nWe prospectively enrolled 24 asymptomatic, severe (\u226570%), unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis patients, who were expecting the intervention of CAS. Cognition assessment (including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Beijing Version, the Minimum Mental State Examination, the Digit Symbol Test, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and the Verbal Memory Test) and an integrated MRI program (pASL MRI, and R-fMRI) were administered 7\u2009days before and 3\u2009months after CAS. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n16 subjects completed the follow-up study. After stenting, significant improvement in the scores of the MMSE, the Verbal Memory test, and the delayed recall was found. No significant difference was found in the scores of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Beijing Version, the Digit Symbol Test, and the immediate recall. After CAS treatment, asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients showed increased perfusion in the left frontal gyrus, increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the right precentral gyrus, and increased connectivity to the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in the right supra frontal gyrus. However, no significant correlations were found between these imaging changes and cognition assessments. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nSuccessful CAS can partly improve cognition in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients. The cognition improvement may be partly attributed to the increased perfusion in the left frontal gyrus, increased ALFF in the right precentral gyrus, and increased connectivity to the PCC in the right supra frontal gyrus. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCarotid artery stenosis without transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke is considered as \u201casymptomatic\u201d ( ,  ). However, a number of studies have demonstrated that asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients had significantly poorer performance in executive function and memory, indicating that \u201casymptomatic\u201d carotid stenosis might not be truly asymptomatic ( \u2013 ). Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) had been traditionally performed to prevent stroke in patients with high-grade carotid stenosis ( ). However, carotid artery stenting (CAS) is now being investigated as an alternative to CEA ( ). Although both CEA and CAS have been proven to reduce future strokes, the effect of CEA and CAS on cognition still remained conflicting ( \u2013 ). \n\nIn past few years, several imaging techniques, such as pulsed arterial spin labeling (pASL) MRI and resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI), had been increasingly used to study cognitive impairment in humans. In this study, we evaluated the cognition performance in severe asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients undergoing CAS and explored the mechanisms underlying the cognition changes by the integrated MRI techniques including pASL MRI and R-fMRI. \n\n\n## Participants, Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria \n  \nFrom January 2015 to June 2016, successful CAS was performed in 24 asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients, and the follow-up study was completed for 16 patients. No vascular complications occurred in these 16 subjects. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age between 55\u2009years and 80\u2009years; (2) unilateral internal carotid artery stenotic degree\u2009\u2265\u200970%; (3) right-hand-dominant; (4) free of stroke, TIA, dementia, and depression; (5) modified Rankin Scale: 0 or 1; (6) no major medical conditions; and (7) obtained written informed consent. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) contralateral internal carotid artery stenosis\u2009\u2265\u200950%; (2) posterior circulation diseases; (3) MMSE\u2009<\u200926, which is a cutoff value for mild cognitive impairment; (4) functional disability (modified Rankin Scale\u2009\u2265\u20092); (5) severe systemic diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases (such as congestive heart failure and history of stroke); (6) any contraindications for MRI scan (e.g., metal implants); (7) low education level (<6\u2009years); (8) evidence of carotid dissection; (9) intracranial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation; and (10) allergy to heparin, aspirin, or clopidogrel. All procedures involved in this study were approved by Zhongnan Hospital Review Board. \n\n\n## CAS Procedure and Clinical Follow-Up \n  \nAfter stenting, all final residual diameter stenosis was \u226420%. Systolic blood pressure was carefully maintained between 100 and 140\u2009mmHg, and no complications were found. Aspirin and clopidogrel were continued for at least 3\u2009months after successful intervention. \n\n\n## Neurocognitive Assessment \n  \nCognition assessments were completed within 1\u2009week after MRI scan. The MMSE and MoCA Beijing Version were used to assess the global cognition. In the Digit Symbol Test, subjects were required to translate numbers to symbols in a given time and correct translations within 90\u2009s were recorded. The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test was used to evaluate the memory and verbal learning ability. In this test, participants had to recall all the words remembered, and this procedure was repeated five times. These were recorded so that the total number of words was immediately recalled during the first five repeats and the delayed recall of the first list. In the Digit Span Test, participants were required to repeat the orally presented lists of numbers, beginning with a two-number sequence, and each correct performance was followed by one additional number. In the forward span, participants were asked to retell the span in forward order, and in the backward span, the participant was asked to retell the span in reverse order. \n\n\n## Brain Imaging Acquisition \n  \nMRI images were acquired using a 3.0\u2009T Siemens scanner in Zhongnan Hospital. T1 images were collected using MP-RAGE sequence. Scan parameters were as follows: flip angle\u2009=\u20099\u00b0, TR\u2009=\u20092,250\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20092.26\u2009ms, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091.0\u2009mm, inversion time\u2009=\u2009900\u2009ms, number of slices\u2009=\u2009176, data matrix\u2009=\u2009215\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, and FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009224\u2009mm. pASL perfusion images were collected using Q2TIPS II technique. Scan parameters were as follows: TR\u2009=\u20092,500\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200911\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009mm, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, FA\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, and slice thickness\u2009=\u20096\u2009mm. R-fMRI was acquired using EPI sequence: repetition time\u2009=\u20092,000\u2009ms, echo time\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, number of slices\u2009=\u200933, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093.8\u2009mm, gap\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm, data matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, and field of view\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009mm. \n\n\n## Image Processing \n  \n### Pulsed arterial spin labeling \n  \nrelCBF maps were automatically generated by Siemens workstation, and the relCBF correct map of each participant was normalized to EPI template provided by Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8). The final voxel size was 3\u2009mm\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm. Each subject\u2019s relCBF map was transformed into standard MNI space using these transformation parameters. The normalized relCBF maps were smoothed for comparisons with 8-mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel. These individual maps were then entered into SPM8 to identify significant different regions between two groups. \n\n\n### R-fMRI Preprocessing \n  \nResting-state functional MRI preprocessing was performed with Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPABI 2.1). The first 10 volumes of each time series were abandoned. Then, the images were corrected for slice timing and realigned. Afterward, images were normalized into standard MNI space and smoothed with 8-mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n### Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuation (ALFF) \n  \nAmplitude of low-frequency fluctuation calculation was performed with Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST 1.8). One-sample   t  -test was performed using SPM8 in each group to detect the regions with higher-than-mean ALFF. Two-sample   t  -test was performed to determine differences between these mALFF images. Significantly different regions were shown on MNI templates. The two-sample   t  -test results were restricted within the mask made from the results of one-sample   t  -tests performed for two groups. \n\n\n### Functional Connectivity \n  \nAll images were filtered with a 0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz band-pass filter to reduce the noise before FC analysis. The ROI was located in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The mean ROI signal was counted by average all voxels in bilateral PCC. The ROI time course was used for correlation analysis with all other voxels in the brain. To normalize the correlation coefficients, Fisher   z  -transform was then applied. One-sample   t  -test was performed using SPM8 in each group to detect the regions with significant connectivity to the PCC. Then, two-sample   t  -test was performed to determine differences between these   z  -FC image groups. Significant different regions were shown on MNI templates. The two-sample   t  -test results were restricted within the mask made from the results of one-sample   t  -tests performed for two groups. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nWe used IBM SPSS 20.0 and SPM8 to perform statistical analyses. Paired Student\u2019s   t  -test was used to detect significant differences, and significance was set at 0.05. Age and education were used as covariates in all tests involving cognition. After analyzing pASL, ALFF, and FC, regions with significant differences were extracted as ROIs, and Spearman correlation was then performed to detect the relationship between imaging differences and cognition scores. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nPart 1: Table   shows the demographic information and cognitive test scores at baseline and 3\u2009months after CAS.

No significant correlation was found between imaging differences and cognition scores (  P  \u2009>\u20090.05 for all). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we found that CAS could improve global cognition (assessed by MMSE) and memory (assessed by Verbal Memory test and delayed recall test) in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients, which is agreed with previous reports ( ,  ). Since cognitive impairment could also predict mortality, it may be misleading that using stroke as the only outcome marker in CEA and CAS ( ). \n\nSilent infarction and cerebral hypoperfusion are the main mechanisms in the development of cognitive decline in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients, indicating that cognition may be improved by reducing silent infarction and restoring CBF. Our results showed the increased regional CBF mainly in the left frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate, left occipital gyrus, and left cerebellum after CAS. The increased CBF found in the occipital gyrus and cerebellum could be explained by the presence of functional circle of Willis. Since frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate consisted of regions that mediated memory and executive function, increased CBF in these regions may contribute to the cognitive improvement after CAS. \n\nIn recent years, more and more studies had demonstrated that cognition output was not dependent on the individual brain region, but dependent on network regions ( ). A number of studies had already demonstrated this opinion in patients with neurodegenerative diseases ( ,  ). The default mode network (DMN) was one of them ( ). By functional MRI and PET studies, the most common DMN components are the PCC, the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the inferior parietal lobule, and other regions ( ,  ). The DMN was suggested to play important role in cognition, such as reviewing past knowledge and processing memory ( ,  \u2013 ). Another reason selecting DMN for analysis was that previous study had demonstrated that DMN was especially easily affected by hypoperfusion ( ). The PCC, supplied by the precuneal artery from its origins at the ICA, had been shown to be a key point in DMN and involved in cognitive decline ( ). \n\nAmong the indexes utilized in R-fMRI, ALFF was a useful index to reflect spontaneous neuronal activities ( \u2013 ). We noted that the asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients showed increased ALFF mainly in the right precentral gyrus after CAS, which belonged to the DMN. Thus, cognitive improvement after CAS could also be partially attributed to the increased activities in these regions. Since previous studies had indicated that the cerebellum not only regulated motor control but also involved in cognition tasks ( ,  ). The decreased ALFF in the cerebellum anterior lobe may further illustrate the cognition role of cerebellum, but the mechanisms had not been illustrated exactly and needed further more studies. \n\nWe compared the FC to the PCC before and after CAS treatment and found that the asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients showed increased connectivity to the PCC mainly in the right supra frontal gyrus after CAS. There was no region showing decreased connectivity to the PCC. The increased regions were also overlapped with the anterior part of the DMN. Since the anterior part of the DMN was specially associated with executive function and memory, the cognitive improvement could also be partially attributed to the increased FC to the PCC in the anterior part of DMN, but no significant correlation was found ( ,  ). \n\nNevertheless, several limitations in this study should be discussed. First, the sample size was not big enough. Second, it was extremely difficult to define the stenosis timing. Longer occlusion duration may potentially affect the cognition reversibility. Third, the follow-up interval was relatively short. Fourth, no control group was included. \n\nIn summary, this prospective study demonstrated that successful CAS could partly improve cognition dysfunction in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients. By the integrated MRI techniques including pASL MRI and R-fMRI, we also found increased perfusion in the left frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate, increased ALFF in the right precentral gyrus, and enhanced connectivity to the PCC in the right supra frontal gyrus after CAS. Since these regions are overlapped with DMN, the cognition improvement by CAS in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients may be partly attributed to these changes. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of \u201cZhongnan Hospital Review Board\u201d with written informed consent from all subjects.

{"text": "Wei, Pengxu and Bao, Ruixue and Lv, Zeping and Jing, Bin\nFront Hum Neurosci, 2018\n\n# Title\n\nWeak but Critical Links between Primary Somatosensory Centers and Motor Cortex during Movement\n\n# Keywords\n\nmotor control\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\nfunctional connectivity\nweighted brain network\ngraph theory\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nMotor performance is improved by stimulation of the agonist muscle during movement. However, related brain mechanisms remain unknown. In this work, we perform a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 21 healthy subjects under three different conditions: (1) movement of right ankle alone; (2) movement and simultaneous stimulation of the agonist muscle; or (3) movement and simultaneous stimulation of a control area. We constructed weighted brain networks for each condition by using functional connectivity. Network features were analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. We found that: (1) the second condition evokes the strongest and most widespread brain activations (5147 vs. 4419 and 2320 activated voxels); and (2) this condition also induces a unique network layout and changes hubs and the modular structure of the brain motor network by activating the most \u201csilent\u201d links between primary somatosensory centers and the motor cortex, particularly weak links from the thalamus to the left primary motor cortex (M1). Significant statistical differences were found when the strength values of the right cerebellum (  P   < 0.001) or the left thalamus (  P   = 0.006) were compared among the three conditions. Over the years, studies reported a small number of projections from the thalamus to the motor cortex. This is the first work to present functions of these pathways. These findings reveal mechanisms for enhancing motor function with somatosensory stimulation, and suggest that network function cannot be thoroughly understood when weak ties are disregarded. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMotor performance is improved by enhancing somatosensory inputs during movement. In sports training, athletic performance is improved by warm-up activities that include muscle contractions other than stretching (Fradkin et al.,  ). High-load dynamic warm-up programs improve the power and strength performance of athletes (McCrary et al.,  ); more intense warm-up trainings generate stronger sensory afferents and result in improved performance and power (Needham et al.,  ). In clinical applications, somatosensory stimulation promotes the motor function of patients suffering from motor deficits; this type of stimulation combined with voluntary muscle contractions induces more significant muscular adaptations than muscle contraction alone (Paillard,  ; Kattenstroth et al.,  ). In addition, augmenting visual feedback with vibrotactile feedback is found to help subjects for reducing errors during motor learning (Bark et al.,  ). \n\nAll these findings feature a notable increase in somatosensory inputs during (Gulick et al.,  ) or very shortly before (Fradkin et al.,  ) voluntary movement. Limb movement excites afferent proprioception receptors in muscles and other soft tissues (Gardner and Johnson,  ). Stimulating contracting muscles directly increases sensory inputs during movement (Gulick et al.,  ). Therefore, high-load dynamic warm-up training can more effectively activate these receptors than static forms, such as stretching. \n\nSeveral studies further reported that when applied over the agonist muscle, somatosensory stimulation exhibits improved effects. In healthy people, electrical stimulation over the agonist muscle during exercise results in improved training effects than either electrical stimulation or exercise only (Willoughby and Simpson,  ). In patients with knee-injury, voluntary exercise alone and voluntary exercise combined with non-simultaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation only induce similar effects (Lepley et al.,  ), whereas muscle strength reduction can be better prevented by Quadriceps muscle contractions combined with simultaneous electrical stimulation compared with muscle contractions alone (Wigerstad-Lossing et al.,  ). \n\nMechanisms through which concurrent somatosensory stimulation changes the motor behavior during movement have not been reported yet in literature. Long-term electrical stimulation or motor training induces muscle adaptations (Paillard,  ), whereas immediate changes in behavior mainly originate from the nervous system (Needham et al.,  ). Thus far, limited information is available regarding the immediate effects of stimulation during voluntary movement on the brain. \n\nMuscle contraction is modulated by motor cortex in complex ways (Fujiwara and Rothwell,  ; Gentner et al.,  ; Huang et al.,  ; Iezzi et al.,  ; Todd et al.,  ; Massie et al.,  ,  ; Fang et al.,  ; Mirdamadi et al.,  ,  ). A study using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) found that somatosensory electrical stimulation strongly increased excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1; Veldman et al.,  ). Stimulation to the median or other nerves can modulate effects of TMS on motor cortex (Tokimura et al.,  ; Stefan et al.,  ), and dorsal root inputs very shortly prior to TMS can facilitate motor response (Roy et al.,  ). These findings indicate that modulating primary afferent connections to motor neurons can possibly change brain function. \n\nTactile-pressure stimulation shares some similarities with non-painful electrical stimuli applied in the aforementioned reports. Physical deformation of the tissue, such as pressure on the skin or stretch of muscles, is sensed by mechanoreceptors. Mechanoreceptors for touch and proprioception are innervated by dorsal root ganglion neurons with large-diameter, myelinated axons. These axons conduct action potentials rapidly and are activated by the non-painful electrical stimuli. In addition, such rapid conduction can provide the prompt sensory feedback required for motor control (Gardner and Johnson,  ). \n\nAside from identifying the neural structures that constitute a functional brain system, characterizing the network properties that comprise functional interactions among many brain regions in the brain system is also important (B\u00fcchel et al.,  ). All brain regions involved in the tasks constitute a network. In a graph-theoretical analysis, the network can be defined as a graph, which is weighted when links (connections among brain regions) are assigned with weights. Weight value can be determined using the magnitude of temporal correlation between each pair of nodes (representing brain regions in the network; Rubinov and Sporns,  ). \n\nWe hypothesize that during voluntary movement, simultaneous stimulation of the agonist muscle induces unique brain activation patterns and network properties compared with movement alone or movement combined with concurrent stimulation over areas without agonist muscles. In the present work, we perform functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the activation and connectivity of the brain under three different conditions: (1) right ankle dorsiflexion (Task) as the baseline; (2) ankle dorsiflexion coupled with simultaneous stimulation to the agonist muscle (Task+AgonistStim); and (3) to a control area without agonist or antagonist muscles going through (Task+ControlStim). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nWe recruited 22 right-handed healthy male volunteers aged 20\u201340 years (25.77 \u00b1 6.27 years). Handedness was determined by a modified version of Annett\u2019s Hand Preference Questionnaire and Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Li and The National Cooperative Research Team for Handedness,  ). One subject could not tolerate MR scanning due to the narrow space inside the scanner. Thus, data were acquired from 21 subjects. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of National Research Center for Rehabilitation Technical Aids with written informed consent from all subjects. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of National Research Center for Rehabilitation Technical Aids. \n\n\n### MRI Scanning \n  \nEach volunteer was subjected to MR scanning with a Siemens Trio Tim 3T MRI system. Gradient echo images with blood-oxygen-level-dependent contrast were collected (TR = 3000 ms; TE = 40 ms; flip angle = 90\u00b0; field of view (FOV) = 240 mm \u00d7 240 mm; matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64). Samples consisted of thirty 5 mm-thick contiguous axial slices. T1-weighted images (3D MPRAGE sequence, TR = 1600 ms; TE = 2.15 ms; flip angle = 9\u00b0; inversion time = 800 ms; FOV = 256 mm \u00d7 256 mm; matrix size = 256 \u00d7 256) were also acquired. \n\n\n### Motor Task \n  \nThe duration of the fMRI experiment was 570 s for each subject. The fMRI session was composed of nine rest\u2013task cycles with 30 s for each period. Eyes were kept closed during scanning. The motor task consisted of repetitive alternating dorsiflexion and relaxation of the right foot (with range reaching 15\u00b0). Foot movements were paced following an audio cue that was sounded every 1.5 s. These small range of motion and medium speed were applied to avoid large head motions. In each task period, the last audio cue is a verbal command \u201cstop\u201d. The verbal command, \u201cready, right foot movement, go\u201d was delivered within a 2 s duration that is 3 s ahead of each task period. These audio cues and commands were recorded in advance and transmitted via the intercom system of the MR scanner. Each subject was trained prior to MR scanning to perform the motor task as gently as possible. \n\n\n### Somatosensory Stimulation \n  \nTactile-pressure stimulation was applied in six of the nine task periods. Three periods were allotted for stimulation of an area over the tibialis anterior (the agonist muscle of movement) or a control area proximal to the right medial malleolus (Supplementary Figure S1). Supplementary Figure S2 shows the sequence of the three conditions, namely, Task, Task+AgonistStim and Task+ControlStim. \n\nA probe and a sponge were used to deliver tactile and pressure stimulations in human studies (Gracely et al.,  ; Stiasny-Kolster et al.,  ; Eickhoff et al.,  ). We modified the stimulation paradigm used in these studies. Tactile-pressure stimulation was applied using a wooden probe (length = 15 cm; diameter = 10 mm) covered with a sponge on the bottom end. Small lead blocks were attached onto the probe 5\u20138 cm from the bottom end to produce a 150 g mass load. The probe was tilted medially 45\u00b0 relative to the vertical position when stimulating the control area and tilted laterally 45\u00b0 when stimulating the tibialis anterior (Supplementary Figure S1). \n\nStimulation was administered along the long axis of the lower leg by brushing the skin of subjects in a back-and-forth manner with the probe at a frequency of 1 Hz and a shift distance of 3 cm. Compared with the smooth surface of a wooden probe, the sponge generated stronger tactile stimulation, resulting in stronger somatosensory input. When brushing the skin, different degrees of smoothness/coarseness of materials evoke different effects (Rolls et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Activation Analysis \n  \nImage analysis was performed using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London, UK). Functional images were motion-corrected, co-registered with structural MR images, spatially normalized into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, resampled to a voxel size of 3.0 mm \u00d7 3.0 mm \u00d7 3.0 mm and spatially smoothed using 6 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Statistical analysis was performed at two levels by using the general linear model. Each condition (task vs. rest) was modeled using a boxcar function convolved with the hemodynamic response function. Significant changes in the signal intensity of each condition were identified using the mixed-effects model in group analysis. The threshold was set at a family-wise error rate correction of   P   < 0.05 with a minimum cluster extent of 10 contiguous voxels. Locations of brain activation, including peak   T   values, were defined using SPM Anatomy Toolbox (Eickhoff et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Network Analysis \n  \nFunctional connectivity is defined as the temporal correlations among spatially remote neurophysiological events. We constructed brain networks for each condition by using functional connectivity measured by task fMRI (Jbabdi et al.,  ). In this work, a brain area was selected as node when activated under the three conditions. Node centers (Supplementary Table S1) were determined by referring to literature data (Francis et al.,  ; Amiez and Petrides,  ) or the center of mass of anatomical areas provided by SPM Anatomy Toolbox; the radius is 3 mm, similar to that used in a previous study (Wei et al.,  ). The waveform of every brain voxel was filtered using a bandpass filter (0.008 <   f   < 0.09) to reduce the effects of low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise. Six parameters obtained by rigid body head motion correction (three-rotation and three-translation parameters) were used as first-level covariates. Signals from ventricular regions, white matter, and their temporal derivatives were removed through linear regression. Pearson correlation coefficients among time courses of nodes were estimated with Conn toolbox designed for resting state and block data (Whitfield-Gabrieli et al.,  ). Correlation coefficients were converted into normally distributed scores by using Fisher\u2019s transform for second-level random effect analysis. \n\nInteractions between nodes in a network were presented as a weighted undirected graph, whose weights were represented by the Fisher-transformed correlation coefficient (beta value) for the corresponding link among network nodes. The threshold of the magnitude of correlations was   P   < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected for multiple comparisons. The magnitude of correlations was used as link weights upon passing such threshold. No link was found between two nodes if the correlation failed to pass the threshold. Three networks corresponding to three conditions were separately constructed, and each network consisted of 23 nodes. \n\nNetwork features (Supplementary Table S2) were analyzed using graph theoretical approaches with Brain Connectivity Toolbox. We measured distance   D   between two nodes with   D   = 1 \u2212   W  , similar to that in a previous study (Achard and Bullmore,  ), where   W   is the weight of the link between two nodes. \n\nNode strength and betweenness are two measures for assessment of hubs in a network (Rubinov and Sporns,  ). Betweenness of a node is the fraction of all shortest paths in networks passing through the node. This parameter is important in controlling information communication across separate parts of the network. In a binary network, the shortest path between two nodes is the path with the minimum number of links between a pair of nodes. Conversely, in a weighted network, the shortest path is the path between two nodes with the minimum sum of weights of constituent links. An optimal pathway is provided by the shortest path between two nodes because rapid transfer is achieved, and the use of system resources is minimized (Boccaletti et al.,  ). \n\nModules are groups of densely interconnected brain regions that are only sparsely connected to the rest of the network. Thus, brain regions within a module achieve a relatively fast rate of information transmission; different modules perform different functions with some degrees of independence (Bassett et al.,  ). \n\nThe obtained modules were compared with degree-, weight- and strength-preserving null models containing the same number of nodes (Rubinov and Sporns,  ; Zalesky et al.,  ). For each network, we generated 100 degree-, weight- and strength-preserving null models containing the same number of nodes. The modular structure was subsequently identified for each constructed null model. Finally, we acquired 100 modular structures from the 100 constructed null models of each network. For each network, correlation coefficient values between the original modular structure and the 100 corresponding results were calculated. If low values were acquired, the modular structures acquired from the original networks are suggested to be unassociated with the weight, degree and strength properties of the original networks (Rubinov and Sporns,  ). \n\nNetworks were visualized with BrainNet Viewer (Xia et al.,  ). Each network structure was also displayed using a force-spring algorithm (Kamada and Kawai,  ) with Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar,  ) to obtain good network visualization (Hidalgo et al.,  ; Hagmann et al.,  ). The algorithm assumes that links are springs between all pairs of nodes and achieves the minimum total spring energy of networks. Two nodes show a larger distance when their connecting links have a lower summation value of weights. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe examined brain activations under three different conditions. All three conditions activated 23 brain regions, including the bilateral supplementary motor cortex (SMA), bilateral cingulate motor area (CMA), bilateral dorsal and ventral premotor cortex (PMd and PMv), bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), bilateral inferior parietal cortex (IPC), bilateral putamen, bilateral insula, bilateral cerebellum, left M1, left primary somatosensory cortex (S1), left superior parietal lobule (SPL), left thalamus and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG). \n\nA weighted functional brain network of each condition is then constructed, and network properties are compared using graph theoretical analysis. \n\n### Task+AgonistStim Evokes Most Extensive Brain Activations \n  \nTask+AgonistStim and Task+ControlStim evoked more extensive brain activations than Task alone, with Task+AgonistStim evoking the most extensive brain activations (Figure  ). In addition, most peaks of Task+AgonistStim showed the highest   T   values over those of the two other conditions (Table  ). An activation cluster (containing 26 voxels from M1, S1 and SPL) was detected for the contrast \u201cTask+AgonistStim minus Task\u201d at a threshold   P   < 0.005 with 10 voxel extent, whereas no activation was found for any other pairwise comparisons. \n  \nBrain activations. Activations evoked by different conditions are projected onto the normalized 3D brain with the BrainNet Viewer ( ). The threshold was set at a family-wise error rate correction of   P   < 0.05 with a minimum cluster extent of 10 contiguous voxels. The bottom row shows commonly activated areas shared by all three conditions; the last column is the midsagittal view of the left hemisphere. The colored bar indicates   t   values. Task+AgonistStim evokes the most extensive brain activations. Top to bottom rows consist of 2370, 5147, 4419 and 2320 activated voxels, respectively. \n    \nPeak activations. \n  \n Among all three conditions, activations evoked by Task+AgonistStim showed highest T values except L_SPL, R_Putamen, L_Thalamus, L_Cerebellum and R_Cerebellum  . \n  \n\n### Most Brain Regions Are Closely Connected Except for Primary Somatosensory Centers \n  \nNodes for network construction include activated brain areas under all three conditions. The three networks contain only positive weighted links. Fully connected network of 23 nodes contains 253 links; Task, Task+AgonistStim, and Task+ControlStim networks comprise 176, 167 and 168 links, respectively. \n\nIn each network, most nodes are highly connected to other nodes, and only a few (thalamus, right cerebellum and left cerebellum) incorporate small number of links (Figure  ). All these nodes are corresponding to primary somatosensory centers in the brain, i.e., the first places to receive somatosensory afferents from the peripheral nervous system via the spinal cord. \n  \nNode degree/strength values.   (A)   Degree values. The degree of a node is the number of links connected to this node. The thalamus, right cerebellum and left cerebellum exhibit the lowest degree values in all networks (only exception is the left putamen in the Task+AgonistStim network). R, right; L, left; SMA, supplementary motor area; M1, primary motor cortex; CMA, cingulate motor area; PMd, dorsal premotor cortex; PMv, ventral premotor cortex; MFG, middle frontal gyrus; S1, primary somatosensory area; SPL, superior parietal lobule; IPC, inferior parietal cortex; S2, secondary somatosensory area.   (B)   Strength values. Node strength is the sum of weights of all links connected to this node. The thalamus, right cerebellum and left cerebellum show the lowest strength values in all networks (except for L_Putamen in the Task+AgonistStim network). Error bars show \u00b1SD.   (C)   Percentage changes in strength values. We use the strength value of each node in the Task network as the baseline (100%). The thalamus, right cerebellum and left cerebellum are nodes with overt increases in strength values in the Task+AgonistStim network, especially the right cerebellum. The Task+ControlStim network shows a distinctive pattern. \n  \nThe thalamus, right cerebellum and left cerebellum are nodes with the lowest node strength values for all networks (Figure  ). Node strength is the sum of weights of all links connected to a node and thus measures the extent of information transmission between this node and other nodes in a network. The three identified regions in the Task+AgonistStim network present increased strength values compared with those in the Task network. These increases were not replicated in the Task+ControlStim network. Comparison of the percentage change in strength values shows that the thalamus, right cerebellum and left cerebellum are nodes with overt increases in strength values in the network of Task+AgonistStim. However, a different trend was found in the Task+ControlStim network, i.e., lower levels of changes in right and left cerebellum but a higher level of changes in the thalamus when compared with the Task+AgonistStim network (Figure  ). \n\n\n### Task+AgonistStim Induces Unique Network Layout \n  \nThe network structure was displayed using a force-spring algorithm (Kamada and Kawai,  ; Figure  ). Each network showed a closely connected \u201ccore\u201d, which contained most cortical motor centers, such as SMA, M1 and CMA, and some peripheral nodes. In the Task network, the thalamus, right cerebellum and left cerebellum were nodes located far from the core; this finding is consistent with the lowest strength values of these nodes (Figure  ) and reveals that these primary somatosensory regions only play minor roles in the Task network. The Task+ControlStim network showed a similar pattern to the Task network. \n  \nDifferent layouts of networks. Layouts are generated using the Kamada\u2013Kawai force-spring layout algorithm ( ). Nodes/links are sized according to their strength values or connection weights. This visualization method shows how brain regions are organized in a network. Each network shows a large \u201ccore\u201d composed of densely-linked nodes with some sparsely connected peripheral nodes. \n  \nThe Task+AgonistStim network exhibited a pattern close to a homogenous distribution; the core part of this network was sparser, whereas the peripheral part was denser than the Task network. The thalamus, right cerebellum and left cerebellum were not the outermost nodes in the network. \n\n\n### Network Hubs of Task+AgonistStim Differ from Those of the Other Conditions \n  \nL_SMA and L_M1 show the highest strength values in the Task network; meanwhile, many nodes show higher strength values than L_M1 in the Task+AgonistStim network, although L_SMA still shows the highest value (Figure  ). Significant statistical differences were found when the strength values of the right cerebellum (  P   < 0.001) or the left thalamus (  P   = 0.006) are compared among the three conditions in 21 subjects by using Friedman test with Bonferroni correction. \n\nIn the Task network, L_SMA and L_M1 show the highest betweenness values, indicating that these nodes are hubs of the network. The two nodes show opposite trends in the Task+AgonistStim network compared with those in the Task network, i.e., a much higher L_SMA (85 vs. 32) and a much lower L_M1 (8 vs. 40, Figure  ). Thus, stimulating agonists remarkably changes the hub of the baseline (the Task network). \n  \nBetweenness values of nodes.   (A)   Many nodes have zero values and are superpositioned on the   x   axis. Topmost nodes in the Task network are L_SMA and L_M1, indicating that these nodes are network hubs. The changes of the two nodes show opposite trends in the Task+AgonistStim network when compared with the Task network, i.e., a higher L_SMA and a lower L_M1 values. Thus, stimulating the agonist muscle remarkably changes the hub of the original network.   (B)   Results of the   post hoc   profile analysis. Blue circles indicate nodes with increased betweenness values in the Task+AgonistStim network when compared with the Task network (Nodes 1). Green circles represent nodes with decreased or unchanged values (Nodes 2). Two groups of nodes demonstrate different trends among three conditions (i.e., unparalleled profiles). \n  \nIn the   post hoc   profile analysis, we divided 23 nodes into two groups: nodes with increased betweenness values in the Task+AgonistStim network compared with the Task network; and nodes with decreased or unchanged values. The profile analysis can test whether or not each segment of data is the same across all groups. Statistically, the profile analysis is similar to the repeated measure ANOVA. Data pass Mauchly\u2019s test of sphericity with   P   = 0.092. The two groups exhibit different trends under the three conditions (i.e., unparalleled profiles) with   F   = 4.963 and   P   = 0.018 (Figure  ). \n\nIn summary, L_M1 and L_SMA were hubs in the Task network, but L_M1 was not considered a hub in the Task+AgonistStim network. \n\n\n### Task+AgonistStim Exhibits a Unique Modular Structure \n  \nTask and Task+ControlStim networks showed similar module structures, whereas the Task+AgonistStim network possessed a unique modular structure (Figure  ). In this network, the newly appearing module contained three sensory relay stations and major cortical and subcortical motor centers. Conversely, we did not observe high somatosensory centers, including S1, S2, SPL, IPC and the insula. \n  \nModules of each network in anatomical space.   (A)   Three networks are visualized with the BrainNet Viewer in the coronal view. Nodes are sized according to nodal strength, and links are sized according to the weight. Nodes in the same module are indicated by the same color. The Task+ControlStim network shows a similar modular structure with the Task network, whereas the Task+AgonistStim network exhibits unique modularity.   (B)   Links among nodes of the new module (blue nodes in the Task+AgonistStim network). Increased numbers of links are observed in three nodes L_thalamus, L_cerebellum and R_cerebellum, especially the thalamus, under conditions receiving sensory stimulation.   (C)   Links between two major centers for cortical motor outputs (L_SMA and L_M1) and three primary sensory relay stations. Only the Task+AgonistStim network shows the link between L_M1 and three primary somatosensory centers (L_Thalamus-L_M1). \n  \nFor each network, we repeated the algorithm 100 times. The modular structure showed 100 identical results. \n\nFor Task, Task+AgonistStim and Task+ControlStim networks, the original modular structure and the 100 corresponding results showed low correlation coefficient values of 0.19 \u00b1 0.13, 0.20 \u00b1 0.13 and 0.17 \u00b1 0.12 (mean \u00b1 SD), respectively. \n\n\n### Weak but Critical Links \n  \nFundamentally, the differences under the three conditions are due to somatosensory stimulation. Applied stimulation modulates the network through three primary somatosensory relay stations in the brain, i.e., the thalamus, right cerebellum and left cerebellum. \n\nIn the Task network, only one link (R_Cerebellum-L_M1) exists between the sensory relay stations and cortical motor centers. Task+ControlStim and Task+AgonistStim networks contain five and eight of such links, respectively (Figure  ). \n\nThe Task+AgonistStim network contains the highest number of such links; this is consistent with its newly appearing module (due to the highest number of connections between brain regions contained in this module) and its unique network layout (due to the increased number of links connecting three primary sensory centers with other nodes). \n\nBoth M1 and SMA are baseline hubs (the Task network). When we focus only on links between these two nodes and three primary sensory relay stations, only one link exists between L_M1 and sensory centers under all conditions (Figure  ). This link, L_Thalamus-L_M1, exhibits the weakest weight value in the network (beta value 0.12; corresponding correlation value: 0.12). A similar link, namely, L_Thalamus-L_SMA, is also weak in the Task+AgonistStim or Task+ControlStim network (beta value = 0.21, 0.22; corresponding correlation values: 0.21, 0.22). Between each of three sensory relay stations and other nodes, all functional connections are weak links (beta values in three networks range from 0.12 to 0.29; corresponding correlation values: from 0.12 to 0.28). \n\nIn the Task+AgonistStim network, the new link L_Thalamus-L_M1 decreases betweenness value of L_M1 by directly sending signals to L_M1 through this new connection during concurrent agonist muscle stimulation. As a result, L_M1 is not required to receive sensory information from multiple sources, including L_IPC, L_Insula, L_S2 and L_Putamen (such links do not exist in the Task+AgonistStim network, Supplementary Figure S3). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we aimed to see whether simultaneous stimulation of the agonist muscle during voluntary movement induced unique brain activation patterns and network properties compared with movement alone or movement combined with concurrent stimulation over areas without agonist muscles. Activated brain areas observed in this study are also reported in a group of studies on motor function (Garavan et al.,  ; Sahyoun et al.,  ; Dimitrova et al.,  ; Kapreli et al.,  ; Hotz-Boendermaker et al.,  ; Newton et al.,  ; Francis et al.,  ; Trinastic et al.,  ). \n\n### Weak Links Play Critical Roles in Network \n  \nThe strongest and largest brain activations were evoked by movement combined with stimulation over the agonist muscle. This condition exhibits some unique network features, thereby proving our hypothesis that unique brain mechanisms are induced by movement combined with concurrent somatosensory stimulation over the agonist muscle. \n\nM1 and SMA are major motor output areas in the brain (Gardner and Johnson,  ; Rizzolatti and Kalaska,  ; Gallivan and Culham,  ). SMA plays a general role in contextual control of voluntary movements. Contextual control is the process of selecting and executing actions based on different combinations of internal and external cues. This process also involves withholding inappropriate actions. This role of SMA promotes the creation of a new thalamus\u2013SMA link by stimulation of either the agonist muscle or the control area. M1 converts both central signals on motor intentions and peripheral sensory inputs on the current state of the limb into motor output commands; both S1 and M1 are activated during active movement (Mima et al.,  ). When the agonist muscle is stimulated, the thalamus\u2013M1 link directly strengthens motor outputs via enhanced sensory afferents. \n\nOur findings reveal that concurrent somatosensory stimulation changes the motor network to modulate motor behavior by changing weak but critical links between the three primary sensory centers and the motor cortex, especially the weakest link L_Thalamus-L_M1 in the Task+AgonistStim network. This phenomenon shows that although the three sensory relay stations are nodes with the lowest strengths and betweenness values, these stations play critical roles in the motor control network via weak links. \n\n\n### Benefits of Thalamus\u2013Motor Cortex Pathway \n  \nSeveral direct fiber connections convey somatosensory inputs from the thalamus to the motor cortex. Somatosensory inputs to the motor cortex mainly arise from S1; the motor cortex including premotor cortex, M1, and SMA also receives several projections from the thalamus (Ghosh et al.,  ). Ninty-three percentage projections from the spinal cord reach the contralateral insula, S2 and CMAs; 4% reaches S1; and only about 3% reaches M1, SMA and other areas (Dum et al.,  ). \n\nTo our knowledge, no studies have revealed the function of small amount of projections from the thalamus to the motor cortex. Based on our results, these pathways are \u201csilent\u201d during voluntary movement at normal levels and activated under certain conditions to achieve improved motor control. Hence, primates are equipped with preserved direct links between the thalamus and the motor cortex. \n\nMotor execution needs somatosensory input for feedforward and feedback control; however, sensory feedback from the periphery is noisy (Wolpert et al.,  ; Schoppe et al.,  ). Neural noise can be counterbalanced by slowing down movements when accuracy is needed (Wolpert et al.,  ); when performing precise motor tasks, moving at lower speed is normal for people. Another solution is involuntary or voluntary warm-up actions during preparation for strenuous activities because these actions can activate shortcuts between the thalamus and the motor cortex. Even people without professional sports training rapidly flex and extend their extremities several times before using their limbs to perform heavy or challenging jobs. For athletes, warm-ups involving voluntary movements lead to improved effects than passive stretching alone (McCrary et al.,  ). Hence, motor control is improved when the agonist muscle receives intensive load and the sensory inputs from the muscle to the brain increases. \n\nLong-term training induces adaptations in soft tissues and muscles, and a short duration of warm-up mainly evokes certain neural mechanisms to upgrade motor control. Our findings reveal that increased somatosensory inputs during movement activate links between primary sensory centers (thalamus and cerebellum) and major motor centers (M1, SMA, PMd and PMv; Supplementary Figure S3), i.e., the shortest pathways between brain centers for processing sensory inputs and motor outputs. \n\nThese shortcuts provide faster pathways of sensory afferent and allow the motor cortex to acquire original sensory inputs. Thus, the deviation of sensory information is avoided, and the noise is reduced. Hence, the topmost motor output centers, especially M1, use faster, less-inaccurate afferent sensory information to achieve improved feedforward and feedback motor control. This effect is best achieved by stimulating the agonist muscle because the link thalamus-M1 is observed only in Task+AgonistStim. In other words, this condition activates such small amount of projections (\u22643%) reported in a previous study (Dum et al.,  ). \n\n\n### When Weak Links Become Important \n  \nIt is believed that nodes and links with higher metric values (e.g., weight of links or different measures of node centrality) are more important in networks (Chklovskii et al.,  ; Boccaletti et al.,  ). However, our findings reveal that weak links play pivotal roles in the network. \n\nStrength of weak ties (Granovetter,  ) is a classic concept in sociology. In a social network, the information flow reaches larger number of people and travels greater distance when passing through weak links rather than strong links. For example, each person is connected to many people. A weak link exists between two persons, A and B, who rarely contact each other; by contrast, strong links exist between A (or B) and his close friends (i.e., people in a same clique/module). When A tells a rumor to his close friends, the message easily spreads within this clique through strong links. However, when A tells the rumor to B (i.e., activating weak links), the message spreads to larger number of people because members of another clique are aware of such rumor. \n\nMore efficient information exchanges occur between relatively unfamiliar units in a network through weak ties. Entrepreneurs scored three times higher on a metric of innovation because weak ties expose people to wider range of ideas and non-redundant information (Ruef,  ). Collaboration between familiar business partners dramatically reduces the probability of investment success, whereas weak ties (ability-matched but unfamiliar partners) enhance investment performance (Paul et al.,  ). \n\nNot all weak links play critical roles. During the stimulation, activated weak links between primary sensory centers and the motor cortex connect two groups that perform distinct functions. These links bridge two heterogeneous groups of brain regions to send unfamiliar (original rather than deviated) sensory information to the motor cortex, thereby remarkably changing the network properties and improving the motor performance. Conversely, low weights at a constant level are noted in the link connecting homogenous brain regions, L_PMd and L_PMv, in the three networks (beta values of 0.19, 0.17 and 0.23). \n\nIn biological networks, weak ties are not valued as much as in social networks. We constantly focus on to strong links and consider weak links as trivial. One aspect of networks is reflected by strong links in connecting nodes that perform similar functions, e.g., stronger coupling between left PMd with right PMd (Supplementary Figure S3); such observation agrees with previously reported results (Bestmann et al.,  ). Weak links that bridge heterogeneous brain regions enrich the diversity of information exchanges, maximize information transfer with minimal wiring cost (Gallos et al.,  ), and reflect another aspect of network properties. \n\n\n### Basic Mechanism of Enhancing Motor Function \n  \nWe propose that the detected weak but critical link is a basic mechanism for enhancing motor control because it can be used to explain a series of phenomena. \n\nFirst, humans move their limbs several times before performing strenuous activities. This behavior may be a subconscious way to use these shortcuts and becomes an inherent habit of warming up for immediate improvement of motor performance. Our findings uncover the neural basis on how both subconscious and professional warm-ups prepare muscles for vigorous actions. \n\nSecond, many techniques apply various types of somatosensory stimuli to modulate motor behavior in sports training (Wigerstad-Lossing et al.,  ; Willoughby and Simpson,  ; Lepley et al.,  ) and clinical settings (O\u2019Sullivan,  ; Paillard,  ; Kattenstroth et al.,  ). Spatiotemporal summation is believed to be a major neural mechanism of these approaches (Harris,  ). Nevertheless, motor performance is also improved by activating weak links between the thalamus and the motor cortex, particularly the link thalamus-M1. \n\nThird, similar to external stimulation over muscles, internally enhanced afferent signals from the agonist muscle (i.e., voluntary contraction with high efforts) also activate these weak links and thus enhance motor control. For example, a therapeutic protocol using voluntary articulation and limb movement improves various functions of individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease (Sapir et al.,  ). This method features intensive effort when performing movement, thereby generating augmented sensory afferents (similar to those resulting from intensive warm-up programs) from highly stimulated agonist muscles. \n\nFinally, several newly-developed medical devices can exert their function through this mechanism; for example, dynamic orthotic clothes for patients with cerebral palsy (Neves,  ) and tremor-canceling glove for patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (Mertz,  ) can generate enhanced proprioceptive inputs and improve motor function. Both devices can use augmented somatosensory afferents for treating diseases with very heavy burdens. \n\nPrimates carry preserved weak but critical links to meet the needs for enhanced motor control. Various phenomena and approaches intentionally or unintentionally use this mechanism under both physiological and pathophysiological states. Insights into these weak links and their roles enlighten us to develop and optimize stimulation modalities and parameters for improving the effects of exercise and treatment protocols. \n\n\n### Limitations and Perspectives \n  \nWe applied somatosensory stimulation over two different areas to rule out possible effects of confounding factors associated with sensory inputs; these confounding factors may influence network dynamics. In the Task+AgonistStim network, three new connections are formed between major motor output areas (SMA and M1) and the three sensory relay stations when compared with the Task network; in the Task+ControlStim network, the connection between left and right cerebellum disappears and there are fewer number of new connections (Figure  ). These results indicate that concurrent somatosensory inputs irrelevant to the motor task interfere with the original sensory-motor interaction process. \n\nWe focused on investigating brain mechanisms and did not perform additional behavioral measures in this study. \n\nIn this work, we aim to reveal mechanisms through which concurrent somatosensory stimulation during movement changes the motor behavior. Our findings reveal that such stimulation changes the brain motor network by modulating weak links between three primary sensory centers and the motor cortex, especially the connection from the thalamus to M1. Scholars reported a small amount of projections from the thalamus to the motor cortex. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to explain the functions of these pathways. Our results reveal a basic mechanism of enhancing motor function by activating these weak but critical links. In addition, our findings suggest that the dynamics of networks cannot be understood when considering only strong links and disregarding weak ties. \n\n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nPW, RB and ZL conducted the experiments, PW and BJ analyzed the data and PW designed the experiments.

One method that has gained recent prominence is the application of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI to white matter, with high-field scanners now being able to better detect the smaller hemodynamic changes present in this tissue type compared to those in the gray matter. However, fMRI techniques have yet to be applied to investigations of neuroplastic change with motor learning in white matter. White matter function represents an unexplored component of neuroplasticity and is essential for gaining a complete understanding of learning-based changes occurring throughout the whole brain. Twelve healthy, right-handed participants completed fine motor and gross motor tasks with both hands, using an MRI compatible computer mouse. Using a crossover design along with a prior analysis approach to establish WM activation, participants received a baseline scan followed by 2 weeks of training, returning for a midpoint and endpoint scan. The motor tasks were designed to be selectively difficult for the left hand, leading to a training effect only in that condition. Analysis targeted the comparison and detection of training-associated right vs left hand changes. A statistically significant improvement in motor task score was only noted for the left-hand motor condition. A corresponding change in the temporal characteristics of the white matter hemodynamic response was shown within only the right corticospinal tract. The hemodynamic response exhibited a reduction in the dispersion characteristics after the training period. To our knowledge, this is the first report of MRI detectable functional neuroplasticity in white matter, suggesting that modifications in temporal characteristics of white matter hemodynamics may underlie functional neuroplasticity in this tissue. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nWhite matter (WM) is a critically important tissue for brain function, making up almost 50% of the brain\u2019s volume ( ), and providing connections between cortical areas in a manner vital for communication throughout neural networks ( ). Despite this, WM has been largely excluded from fMRI investigations. By extension, very little is known about the role of WM in brain network activation, and changes in functional activity with time. By focusing neuroplasticity investigations solely on GM areas of brain we restrict our understanding of the complex changes that underly processes such as learning and rehabilitation. Indeed, a focus on WM activation is critical as this has historically been a \u201cblind spot\u201d in functional MRI research ( ). \n\nThough studies using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal have largely focused on gray matter (GM), improved MRI technology is allowing for the detection of the lower amplitude BOLD signals coming from WM ( ). Early investigations into capturing WM BOLD signal found it detectable at high field strengths.  ,   demonstrated WM fMRI signal at 4T by using an asymmetric spin echo (ASE) sequence to improve sensitivity to the comparatively smaller WM signal. Higher field strengths have an increased ability to detect WM BOLD activation ( ), and ASE sequences likewise have increased sensitivity ( ).  ,  , and   provide reviews of the evidence in support of the biological basis of WM BOLD fMRI activation. \n\nA great deal of the existing WM BOLD research has focused on the corpus callosum, as the large and isolated nature of the tract makes it ideal for investigations of WM activity ( ,  ;  ). However, there have also been numerous reports of detectable activation in the internal capsule, linked with motor functions such as swallowing ( ) and finger tapping tasks ( ;  ). Similar to the corpus callosum results ( ), WM activation in the internal capsule has been integrated with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) results and the larger GM activation network. \n\nFollowing the initial technical research, WM BOLD signal was subsequently detected in a number of resting state and task-based fMRI studies ( ;  ;  ;  ) at conventional field strengths. The successful detection of WM BOLD at conventional field strengths and standard sequences improved the accessibility and adoptability within the field of research. \n\nMore recently, advanced analysis has investigated the unique hemodynamics of white matter, showing that there are different patterns of blood flow within this tissue type.   demonstrated that sensitivity to WM BOLD signals could be improved by using a WM specific hemodynamic response function (HRF). The hemodynamic response in the corpus callosum has been shown to have a delayed onset slope and delayed peak time when compared to GM ( ).   further confirmed this and found that the hemodynamic profile of WM may differ considerably throughout the brain ( ). This is a contributing factor to the lack of detected WM activation in the literature, as the use of hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) modeled on the properties of GM may not properly reflect the WM signal ( ). \n\nThough WM is an active functional tissue, investigation into the role of WM in neuroplasticity has historically been limited to structural and microstructural measures. DTI is a leading modality, and though it only offers structural information, it is the foundation of WM neuroplasticity quantification. Specifically, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) have been used as key biomarkers of WM structure. Numerous studies have demonstrated a measurable change in FA and MD during longitudinal monitoring of visual and motor training tasks ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Cross sectional investigations corroborate this link between WM structure and function. Proficiency in skills such as music, dance, and fine motor tasks have been linked with population difference in FA ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Significant changes in WM tract myelination, another key biomarker of WM structure, have also been shown in visuo-motor training tasks ( ). \n\nMore recently, a 4-week motor training activity was shown to increase FA in several white matter tracts associated with motor activity. An increase in FA within the right CST, along a tract seeded from areas activated by the tapping task, was found ( ). This task showed a significantly lateralized difference in motor training across several modalities between participants non-dominant and dominant hands. The evidence of motor learning-based changes in fMRI ( ) and WM structure ( ) provided the model for our experimental design in order to best elicit evidence of WM functional neuroplasticity. \n\nGiven the established role of WM in motor learning, the aim of this study was to apply functional measures of motor learning and plasticity. The first objective was to extend previous findings of WM activation in the internal capsule, showing lateralized activation based on the hand used during the task. Given the novel experimental paradigm, an established analysis approach was used to first establish WM activation. The second objective was to show WM activation changes consistent with a behavioral motor learning effect. Building on the established differences in WM hemodynamic properties, we included metrics to assess HRF changes beyond traditional measures of BOLD amplitude and extent. This allowed a more complete investigation into functional WM changes during neuroplasticity. \n\nHypothesis 1 predicted that WM activation would be detectable in the contralateral internal capsule for both non-dominant and dominant hands. Hypothesis 2 predicted reduced WM HRF variability as a function of neuroplasticity, particularly in the non-dominant hand. The research employed a repeat measures crossover design that included three longitudinal scan sessions (baseline, midpoint, and endpoint). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwelve healthy, right-handed participants were recruited (7 females). The mean age of the participants was 25.8 \u00b1 3.7 years. Right hand dominance was confirmed using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ( ). Subjects did not report psychiatric or neurological illness, or recent concussions. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. \n\n\n### Experimental Design \n  \nA 2-week motor training experiment was developed, similar in design as   and  . The motor training block task paradigm was developed in PsychToolbox3 ( ;  ), a package of MATLAB (R2018b, The MathWorks, Inc.). Participants used an MRI compatible mouse (Nata Technologies, Coquitlam B.C.) to guide a cursor through a marked trail displayed on the monitor. Participants were instructed to minimize errors and maximize distance traveled. Performance metrics were recorded based on speed and accuracy. The task difficulty was designed to emphasize the difference in dominant and non-dominant hand proficiency. \n\nParticipants received a baseline scan during which a fine motor learning task was completed once with each hand, counterbalanced with a matched gross motor comparison task (results not included for brevity). The fine motor learning task involved accurate, rapid tracing of randomize trail mazes, with performance scores incorporating distance and error-rate. All scans were 6 min long with seven on-blocks of 24 s each during which a unique trail was displayed. These on blocks were interleaved with jittered rest blocks averaging 24 s. Each scan began and ended with a rest block. The trails were designed to be too complex to be completed in a single 24 s block. The gross motor training task followed the same block structure and visual display as the fine motor task, but simply had the participants move the mouse at random, with no accuracy metrics. \n\nFollowing the baseline scan, participants completed 2 weeks of daily \u201cat-home\u201d task training with both non-dominant and dominant hands. During the training period each participant underwent a midpoint scan (after 1 week) and an endpoint scan following the same scanning protocol as baseline. \n\n\n### MRI Acquisition \n  \nMRI scans were acquired from using a 3 Tesla Philips Ingenia CX MRI scanner with a 32-channel dStream head coil. Functional MRI images were acquired using an FFE single-shot GRE-EPI sequence. The acquisition parameters were as follows: TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 30 ms, and flip angle = 90\u00b0. Data were collected with an in-plane resolution of 3 \u00d7 3 mm and slice thickness 3 mm with matrix dimensions of 80 \u00d7 80 voxels and 36 slices. \n\nHigh-resolution T1-weighted images were collected at each session for co-registration of functional images. The acquisition parameters were as follows: TR = 8.2 ms, TE = 3.7 ms, and flip angle = 8\u00b0. Data were collected with an in-plane resolution of 1 \u00d7 1 mm and slice thickness of 1 mm with matrix dimensions of 288 \u00d7 288 voxels and 213 slices. \n\n\n### MRI Analysis \n  \nData were analyzed using FMRIB Software Library 6.0.0 (FSL) ( ). Pre-statistical processing was completed using FEAT (6.0), and brain extraction was completed using BET. Images were motion corrected using MCFLIRT, spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 5 mm, and high pass filtered with a cutoff of 100 s. Functional images were registered to T1 weighted anatomical images using FLIRT, and to MNI152 standard space using FNIRT. \n\nTo test the hypotheses, analysis was targeted specifically to WM functional activity as the changes in GM BOLD signal will be the subject of future analyses. To this end, predictors were constructed in a manner based on the work of  , which compared the use of a conventional GLM to a model that included HRF basis sets generated in FLOBS. This created an HRF designed to better reflect white matter hemodynamics.   showed increased sensitivity to WM activation using the WM HRF, and as such we have followed these procedures in our current work. This method used a linear optimized basis set for the HRF convolution generated in the FSL toolkit \u201cFMRIB\u2019s Linear Optimal Basis Sets\u201d (FLOBS) ( ). The parameters used follow the procedures laid out in   and were inputted as follows: M1 = 0\u20134 s, M2 = 3\u201312 s, M3 = 3\u20135 s, M4 = 3\u20135 s, c = 0\u20130.3, Bases = 3. These parameters specify a range of example HRFs, with delayed onset slope and a reduced initial overshoot, to better reflect WM hemodynamics ( ). From this set of HRFs, FLOBS uses principal component analysis to generate an \u201coptimal basis set\u201d which maximally spans the specified space. Further information on the proofs underlying the FLOBS toolkit can be found in the FSL technical documentation, or in  . \n\nThree bases were generated; an \u201cHRF-like\u201d curve, a \u201clatency derivative\u201d that modeled the temporal lag of the HRF, and a \u201cdispersion derivative\u201d that modeled differences in width of the HRF. The bases were convolved with the stimulus time series to determine group differences of both HRF amplitude and associated temporal characteristics ( ). \n\nStatistical analyses were computed using a generalized linear model for generating cluster-based contrasts corrected for multiple-comparisons. Individual level z-statistics were generated from task vs. rest contrast using significance thresholds of   z   > 2.5 (  p   < 0.05, corrected). \n\nGroup level statistical analyses were computed using FSL\u2019s FEAT function with FLAME mixed effects. Timepoint contrast for group level analyses compared baseline and endpoint with significance thresholds of (  p   < 0.05, FWE) for each of the HRF bases. \n\nRegions of interest masks of white matter were generated from the Harvard-Oxford subcortical structure atlas using conservative thresholds (50%) to reduce the chance of partial volume effects. Masks of gray matter areas associated with motor learning in tracing tasks were generated from the J\u00fclich Histological Atlas and the MNI Structural atlas using typical thresholds (20%). \n\nThe timeseries BOLD data within the right internal capsule ROI were analyzed during the left-hand task. The BOLD signal was averaged across voxels within the ROI and the timeseries data were windowed around the stimulus presentation times. Subsequently, the timeseries mean were subtracted from the BOLD response. Group averaged ROI BOLD intensity were plotted with respect to stimulus onset times for the baseline and endpoint data. Additionally, the group level standard deviation in BOLD signal was computed and plotted at the baseline and endpoint. \n\n\n### Behavioral Analysis \n  \nA two way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effect of hand and scan timepoint on the behavioral scores.   Post hoc t  -tests (pairwise, two-tailed) were run to interrogate the timepoint contrasts of the behavioral results, looking at the difference between baseline and endpoint scan for each hand. The significance level was set using Bonferroni adjusted   p   < 0.025 across the two   t  -tests (\u03b1 = 0.05/2). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Performance \n  \nThe two way repeated measures ANOVA confirmed a significant effect of hand and scan timepoint on the behavioral scores. The   post hoc t  -tests (pairwise, two-tailed) revealed a significant difference for the left-hand tracing scores between baseline and endpoint, (  p   < 0.005, \u03b1 = 0.025). After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons all results remained significant. There was no significant difference for the right-hand tracing scores between baseline and endpoint, (  p   = 0.099). \n\n\n### Individual Timepoint WM fMRI \n  \nThe analysis of fMRI data was collapsed across groups and analyzed as a baseline vs. endpoint contrast, focusing on our non-dominant/dominant hand training comparison. Local maxima of activation were detected within the internal capsule in a lateralized manner at the group level for both baseline and endpoint with typical thresholds of   z   > 2.5. In order to isolate the white matter local maxima, data were re-thresholded at   z   > 4 (  p   < 0.05, FWE), revealing several peaks of activation within white matter areas. Cluster maps were then masked using the internal capsule ROI as seen in  . Resulting internal capsule activation is summarized in  . \n  \nWM activation revealed in the internal capsule. Activation is lateralized as expected, and still present when conservatively thresholded masks are applied. Images displayed in radiological convention, right side of brain on left side of image. (  z   > 4,   P   < 0.05, FWE corrected). \n    \nVoxels showing activation within the internal capsule at each timepoint (  z   > 4,   P   < 0.05, FWE corrected, clusters of 10 or more voxels reported). \n    \n\n### Timepoint Comparisons \n  \nWhile WM activation was detected across timepoints, a baseline vs. endpoint comparison revealed no detectable changes, even at low thresholds. \n\nA major objective of this research was to investigate the temporal changes of the hemodynamic response in white matter as a functional of neuroplasticity. The subsequent analysis investigated the changes in temporal characteristics of the HRF pre and post training. Timepoint comparisons of the latency derivative revealed no significant findings in any condition. \n\nHowever, group level Baseline > Endpoint comparisons of the dispersion derivative revealed a significant cluster of voxels within the internal capsule for the non-dominant hand tracing condition ( ). Information for the significant cluster is summarized in  . This shows a significant reduction in variance of the HRF in WM motor related tracts after the training period. The change in dispersion is aligned well with the structure of the internal capsule, as can be noted in   (peak cluster voxel 82.7% right cerebral white matter, Harvard-Oxford Subcortical Structure Atlas).   presents a comparison between the group block averaged time series data at baseline and endpoint for voxels within the internal capsule ROI. No other conditions revealed significant changes. The reverse contrast revealed no significant results for any condition. \n  \nRight internal capsule showing greater HRF dispersion at group level, baseline > endpoint (  z   > 2.5,   p   < 0.05, FWE corrected). No mask applied. \n    \nVoxels displaying positive parameter estimates for the timepoint 1 > timepoint 3 contrast of the dispersion derivative (  z   > 2.5,   P   < 0.05, FWE corrected). \n      \nAverage across ROI voxels with subtracted mean BOLD signal intensity for baseline (orange) and endpoint (blue). Group level standard deviation plotted around timepoint BOLD signal intensity means. Time at 0 s represents the stimulus onset time. Note that the standard deviation is greater at baseline than endpoint. \n  \nTo better visualize the changes occurring in the WM HRF dispersion derivative   plots the group BOLD signal averages and standard deviation. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe results supported Hypothesis 1, with WM activation detected in the contralateral internal capsule for both non-dominant and dominant hands. Examination of WM HRF results also supported Hypothesis 2, with reduced WM HRF dispersion as a function of neuroplasticity in the non-dominant hand. \n\nTask fMRI revealed clusters of activation with local maxima within the internal capsule, in a manner lateralized as expected ( ; right internal capsule activity during the left-hand task, left internal capsule activity during the right-hand task). A conservative white matter mask of the internal capsule and corticospinal tract was used to verify that the clusters were not the result of partial volume effects. Additionally, in   it can be noted that even without masking, the detected activation occurs in an area without adjacent gray matter activation, further addressing partial volume effects. \n\nThe use of a WM specific HRF was key for increasing sensitivity to WM functional activation at conventional MRI field strengths. Our results align well with previous reports of WM activation in the internal capsule ( ), with similar lateralization and localization of activation. However, previous studies were completed in a 4T scanner, using a specialized ASE sequence, optimized for WM detection. Higher field strengths have a notable impact on the ability to detect WM BOLD activation ( ) and ASE sequences have improved sensitivity compared to the traditional GRE-EPI sequences ( ). The strong agreement between our current results and previously published reports of activation in the internal capsule ( ;  ;  ) supports the conclusion that a WM specific HRF model is critical for obtaining a holistic representation of brain function ( ). \n\nThe analysis into adaptation of HRF profile over time revealed significant reduction in the dispersion ( ). The white matter hemodynamic changes selectively occurred in the contralateral internal capsule for the non-dominant hand only. As seen in   this cluster aligns well with white matter motor related tracts, even at conventional thresholds with no masking. This finding paralleled the behavioral results where only the non-dominant hand showed significant learning effects. \n\nIt can be noted that even without masking, the pattern of maximum HRF dispersion change occurs over the anatomy of the internal capsule, with a local maximum occurring at the genu, and activation spreading backwards along the posterior limb. Though motor signals from the corticospinal tract are traditionally thought to travel through the posterior limb of the internal capsule, more recent research has debated the exact localization of these representations ( ;  ) and the function of the genu ( ). Evidence from non-human primates using histopathology and retrograde traces from motor areas showed that arm representations are distributed throughout the internal capsule in an overlapping manner, with fibers from the supplementary motor area passing through the genu ( ). \n\nIn future, the investigation into the temporal characteristics of the WM HRF represents a novel detection of functional neuroplasticity in WM. Variation in HRFs is typically quantified using the dispersion derivative ( ). HRF profiles have been shown to be extremely variable in white matter, contrary to the consistent HRF throughout gray matter ( ), and thus warrant further investigation as they relate to neuroplasticity. Given the variability of HRF shapes within separate WM areas, modeling the temporal and dispersion derivatives at group level was essential for the detection of WM functional changes ( ;  ). In particular, direct examination of spatial changes in HRFs through novel methods like functional correlation tensors (FCT;  ) will be important to evaluate the detectable extent of BOLD fMRI activity within the larger WM tract. Given that specific GM HRF assumptions around features and analysis approaches may not generalize to WM HRFs, the continued work to narrow down WM-specific features and analysis approach may also be more complex in light of the spatially distributed nature of the activation across WM tracts. Multimodal integration with DTI and other methods will therefore be critical. \n\nThe recorded changes in WM function are intrinsically linked to changes in structure.   and   found increases in fractional anisotropy, seeded by sensorimotor cortex fMRI activation, throughout the right corticospinal tract after a similar motor training paradigm. We expect that similar changes in the structure of the internal capsule as a result of motor training are responsible for the observed changes in WM hemodynamic response in this work. A better understanding of brain changes in terms of both structure and function is essential for a comprehensive picture of the impact of motor training and rehabilitation. \n\nWhile fMRI lacks the ability to draw direct inferences about the underlying cellular or hemodynamic processes at play, there are a few possible physiological mechanisms that may be driving this change. We postulate that the most probable microstructural change underlying our results is an increase WM tract myelination ( ). This phenomenon, that has been detected in motor related WM tracts during training ( ;  ;  ), may drive an increase in neural efficiency. Increased myelination within the white matter tracts improves efficient propagation of action potentials, due to a reduced ion flux during each action potential propagation and thus reduced work to re-establish the resting membrane potential ( ). More efficient action potentials reduce the rate in which energy stores in the neurons are depleted, thus changing their metabolic demands and the resulting hemodynamic response. Underlying factors, such as these, understandably contribute to variation in the HRF profile. \n\nDespite the reports of structural and microstructural changes throughout the corticospinal tract no activation was detected in the corticospinal tract above the internal capsule. This too reflects several previous reports of isolated activation in this region ( ;  ;  ). WM exhibits a high level of anisotropy compared to GM, meaning that the neural tissue and supporting vasculature are largely oriented in a single direction. Anisotropic tissue oriented parallel to the main magnetic field has a reduced ability to produce a detectable BOLD signal ( ;  ). The majority of the corticospinal tract is one such anisotropic tract, which aligns parallel to the main magnetic field. The internal capsule, however, exhibits greater isotropy of the fibers compared to the rest of the corticospinal tract which may offer an explanation for the bounded BOLD signal detection in this region. \n\nWhile the current work supports the idea that WM activation can be used to track neuroplasticity, there are a few limitations to interpretation. First, we employed a basic block design, that allowed for higher amplitude hemodynamic responses, helping to compensate for the smaller hemodynamic changes seen in white matter. A jittered interstimulus interval was employed to eliminate long latency hemodynamic effects and allow for the interrogation of latency and dispersion effects. However, employing an event related design in future work will allow for more granular inferences about short latency effects. This work also used a generalized linear model to investigate significant temporal changes between time points. This allowed us to highlight areas where the most change occurred. However, sampling HRFs throughout the white matter and comparing them could allow for comparison within and between white matter tracts. The sample size of this investigation is small and represents an important consideration for statistical power. Future analyses would benefit from a greater participant number, particularly for detecting small signal changes inherent to WM BOLD. \n\nFuture work will use a technique called functional correlation tensors ( ) that can be used to analyze local synchronicity in hemodynamic fluctuations. Functional correlation tensors will be used to further investigate the reduced variability in hemodynamic response throughout the whole brain. Future investigations will also explore co-localizing functional results with DTI to relate WM structural changes with WM BOLD neuroplasticity. Corresponding structural or microstructural information is needed to further understand the underlying mechanisms of WM fMRI activation. \n\nThis work has determined that a 2-week motor training task can elicit detectable changes in WM BOLD signal. The temporal characteristics of the WM HRF can be altered as a result of training; manifesting as a reduction in the dispersion of the hemodynamic response. This work has highlighted importance of the temporal characteristics of functional activity, particularly for longitudinal analysis of WM activation. This represents an important new direction for future analyses of both white matter neuroplasticity, as well as analysis of BOLD activation in white matter. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Simon Fraser University Research Ethics Board.

However, whether holistic reinstatement occurs, and whether hippocampal pattern completion continues to drive reinstatement, after a period of consolidation is unclear. Theories of systems consolidation predict either a time-variant or time-invariant role of the hippocampus in the holistic retrieval of episodic events. Here, we assessed whether episodic events continue to be reinstated holistically and whether hippocampal pattern completion continues to facilitate holistic reinstatement following a period of consolidation. Female and male human participants learned \u201cevents\u201d that comprised multiple overlapping pairs of event elements (e.g., person\u2013location, object\u2013location, location\u2013person). Importantly, encoding occurred either immediately before or 24\u2005h before retrieval. Using fMRI during the retrieval of events, we show evidence for holistic reinstatement, as well as a correlation between reinstatement and hippocampal pattern completion, regardless of whether retrieval occurred immediately or 24\u2005h after encoding. Thus, hippocampal pattern completion continues to contribute to holistic reinstatement after a delay. However, our results also revealed that some holistic reinstatement can occur without evidence for a corresponding signature of hippocampal pattern completion after a delay (but not immediately after encoding). We therefore show that hippocampal pattern completion, in addition to a nonhippocampal process, has a role in holistic reinstatement following a period of consolidation. Our results point to a consolidation process where the hippocampus and neocortex may work in an additive, rather than compensatory, manner to support episodic memory retrieval. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Significance Statement \n  \nThe hippocampus plays a critical role in the recollection of episodic events. However, its role in episodic memory retrieval over time is still debated with theories of systems consolidation predicting both time-limited and time-invariant roles. We used fMRI and an experimental assay of holistic episodic memory retrieval to assess hippocampal pattern completion and its relationship to neocortical reinstatement across delay. We provide evidence that hippocampal pattern completion is associated with neocortical reinstatement following delay but that some reinstatement can occur without a corresponding signature of hippocampal pattern completion. Our results suggest that hippocampal pattern completion, in addition to an emergent nonhippocampal process, may play an additive role in the recollection of episodic memories following a period of consolidation. \n\n\n## Introduction \n  \nThe recollection of episodic events is holistic in nature ( ;  ), underpinned by a hippocampal pattern completion process ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) that drives the reinstatement of event information in the neocortex ( ;  ;  ). \n\nEvidence for hippocampal pattern completion and holistic neocortical reinstatement has been shown immediately following encoding ( ;  ). However, we do not yet know whether this relationship changes following a delay. This is a critical question as standard theories of consolidation predict a time-limited role for the hippocampus ( ;  ), while others argue that the hippocampus is always required for episodic retrieval ( ;  ;  ). \n\nThere is evidence for decreases in ( ;  ;  ) and sustained ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) hippocampal activity during retrieval following a delay (see also  ). Critically, most previous studies have compared hippocampal activity (or multivariate patterns) at immediate and delayed retrieval and therefore have not directly assessed whether hippocampal pattern completion continues to mediate the reinstatement of episodic events in the neocortex. Importantly, changes in univariate activity over time could be driven by different mechanisms not related to systems consolidation, such as differential rates of forgetting for independent neocortical and hippocampal representations formed at encoding ( ;  ;  ). Thus, by directly assessing the relationship between hippocampal pattern completion and neocortical reinstatement across delay, we can more directly assess the mechanistic predictions of systems consolidation theories. \n\nHere, we used an experimental assay of episodic memory ( ;  ) that allowed us to assess the delay-(in)variant role of hippocampal pattern completion in neocortical reinstatement. Across two encoding sessions, separated for \u223c24\u2005h, participants learned three-element events. Events were learned over two or three separate encoding trials, with each trial presenting one of three possible pairs for an event. Events had different associative structures: \u201cclosed-loops\u201d where all three pairs were encoded and \u201copen-loops\u201d where only two of the three pairs were encoded. At retrieval, we tested each of the learned pairs from each event, with half of the events learned \u223c24\u2005h before retrieval and the other half learned immediately before retrieval. \n\nWe identified neocortical regions that showed differences in the BOLD activity between elements that were the cue or target of retrieval and those that were nontargets. Greater activity for closed- versus open-loops in nontarget regions was then used as a marker of holistic neocortical reinstatement ( ). Next, we correlated nontarget neocortical reinstatement with a signature of hippocampal pattern completion (closed- vs open-loop hippocampal activity), for events encoded immediately and \u223c24\u2005h earlier. We used a general linear mixed-effects model to assess both the slope and the intercept of the relationship between the hippocampal contrast and neocortical reinstatement. \n\nA slope greater than zero would indicate a positive correlation, consistent with hippocampal pattern completion contributing to holistic neocortical reinstatement. If the steepness of the slope is consistent across delay, this would indicate a continued role for hippocampal pattern completion, while a shallower (or zero) slope in the delay relative to immediate condition would suggest a time-limited role. Critically, in the presence of a positive slope, a zero intercept would suggest that holistic reinstatement only occurs in the presence of hippocampal pattern completion. An intercept greater than zero would indicate that some holistic reinstatement can occur without a corresponding signature of pattern completion. This would point to an emergent nonhippocampal contribution that is additive (rather than compensatory) to the role of hippocampal pattern completion in holistic reinstatement. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAn effect size   d  \u2009=\u20090.67 for detecting a significant nontarget reinstatement effect was calculated from previous work ( ) with   n  \u2005=\u200526. Cohen\u2019s   d   was calculated from the reported   t  -statistic divided by the square root of the within-subject sample size ( ). As forgetting is expected to occur when retrieval follows a \u223c24\u2005h delay, retrieval accuracy is expected to be lower than the finding reported in  . Pilot data collected with   n  \u2009=\u200912 revealed \u223c14% decrease in retrieval accuracy following a 24\u2005h delay, leading to an adjusted effect size   d  \u2009=\u20090.62. Using G*Power ( ) and the adjusted effect size   d  \u2009=\u20090.62, we estimated that a sample size of   n  \u2009=\u200930 would be required to detect a significant nontarget reinstatement effect, if one is present, at a power of 0.90 and   \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.05. \n\nGiven that previously reported effect sizes are likely to be overestimates of the true effect size, and because we wanted to compare neocortical reinstatement as well as hippocampal\u2013neocortical correlations between two conditions, we aimed to obtain 50 useable datasets (upper limit set by resource constraints). An initial sample of   n  \u2009=\u200930 was collected and analyzed (due to time constraints in relation to submitting a PhD thesis; reported in  ) before the final sample was collected. \n\nFifty-seven right-handed participants were recruited from the University of York student population. All participants gave written informed consent and took part in exchange for course credit or monetary compensation. Participants had either normal or correct-to-normal vision and reported no history of neurological or psychiatric illness. Data from seven participants could not be included in the final sample due to motion-related artifacts in the imaging data (  n  \u2009=\u20091), scanner faults resulting in no acquired imaging data (  n  \u2009=\u20092), or below chance memory performance (accuracy <\u223c16.7%;   n  \u2009=\u20094). Accordingly, the analyses included 50 participants (39 female, 11 male) with a mean age of 21.6\u2005years\u2009\u00b1\u20094.43 SD. The experiment was approved by the York Neuroimaging Centre ethics committee, University of York, United Kingdom. \n\n\n### Materials \n  \nThe stimuli consisted of 72 locations (e.g., kitchen), 72 famous people (e.g., Barack Obama), and 72 common objects (e.g., hammer). From these, 72 random location\u2013person\u2013object events were generated for each participant. Note that we used the term \u201cevent\u201d to refer to the three elements (location, person, object) that were assigned to the same associative structure (closed- or open-loop), leaving aside any considerations as to how these relate to real-world events ( ). \n\nEach of the 72 events was assigned to the within-subject conditions of loop (open-loop or closed-loop) and delay (delay or no-delay). Thus, 18 different events were randomly assigned to either (1) open-loop, delay; (2) closed-loop, delay; (3) open-loop, no-delay; or (4) closed-loop, no-delay. For closed-loops, all three possible pairwise associations for each event were encoded, while for open-loops, only two out of the three possible pairwise associations were learnt. Events were never presented together at encoding or retrieval; only specific pairwise associations were encoded and retrieved for each event, depending on whether they were open- or closed-loop. Note that open-loops are equated to closed-loops in the number of elements, but not in the number of pairs. We have previously shown ( ;  ) that dependency is not seen for open-loops when three overlapping pairs are encoded as an associated chain (e.g., kitchen\u2013hammer, kitchen\u2013Barack Obama, Barack Obama\u2013dog), controlling for the number of associations (but not the number of elements). Any differences in retrieval between the two conditions in the current experiment are therefore unlikely to be driven by differences in the number of associations. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nThe experiment consisted of two encoding sessions and a single retrieval session. Both encoding sessions took place outside the scanner and were separated by \u223c24\u2005h (M\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD  \u2009  =\u200923\u2005h, 54\u2005min\u2009\u00b1\u2009130\u2005min), including overnight sleep. The retrieval session took place inside the scanner immediately after the second encoding session. \n\n#### Encoding \n  \nDuring encoding, participants were presented with specific pairwise associations from each of the 72 events. Participants learned one pairwise association per encoding trial. All pairwise associations were presented on a computer screen as words, with one item to the left and one item to the right of fixation ( ). The left/right assignment was randomly chosen on each trial. The words remained on screen for 6\u2005s. Participants were instructed to imagine, as vividly as possible, the elements interacting in a meaningful way for the full 6\u2005s. Each word-pair presentation was preceded by a 500\u2005ms fixation and followed by a 500\u2005ms blank screen. For 36 out of the 72 events, participants encoded all three possible pairwise associations; forming closed-loops ( ). For the remaining 36 triplets, participants encoded two out of the three possible pairwise associations; forming open-loops ( ). Eighteen closed- and 18 open-loops were randomly assigned to each of the encoding sessions, resulting in a total of 90 encoding trials per encoding session (i.e., 54 closed-loop and 36 open-loop trials per session). Participants were not told that any pairwise associations would overlap with each other at encoding nor were they told about the open- and closed-loop structures. \n  \nExperimental design.    A   , Encoding. Participants saw multiple pairwise associations. They imagined each association \u201cinteracting in a meaningful way as vividly as possible\u201d for 6\u2005s. Each association was preceded by a 500\u2005ms fixation and followed by a 500\u2005ms blank screen. Participants encoded open- and closed-loop pairwise associations in an intermixed manner. In the open-loop condition, participants did not encode the third and final association (e.g., wallet\u2013Beckham; see    D   ). Solid and dotted lines were not presented but highlighted closed- (solid lines) and open-loops (dotted lines).    B   , Retrieval. Participants were presented with a single cue and required to retrieve one of the other elements from the same event from among the five foils (elements of the same type from other events) in 6\u2005s. Each cued-recognition trial was preceded by a 1\u2005s fixation and followed by a 1\u2005s blank screen.    C   , The associative structures of closed-loops with example encoding order for three pairwise associations (numbers 1\u20133).    D   , The associative structure of open-loops with example encoding order for the two pairwise associations (numbers 1\u20132). The third and final association (i.e., person\u2013object in this example) was not shown to the participants. \n  \nEach encoding session consisted of three blocks of 18, 36, and 36 trials, respectively, with one pairwise association from each event presented during each block. Each encoding session contained novel events for the open- and closed-loop conditions that were not presented in the other encoding session. During the first encoding block, only pairwise associations for closed-loops were presented. This ensured that the duration between encoding the last pairwise association and retrieval was consistent for closed- and open-loops from each encoding session. In blocks 2 and 3, the open- and closed-loop associations were randomly presented in an intermixed manner. The presentation order was randomized for each block. A break of 10\u2005s followed every 18 encoding trials. \n\nEach open-loop consisted of a common element (e.g., if participants encoded location\u2013person, and location\u2013object pairs, then location would be the common element). For each encoding session, 6 out of the total 18 open-loops were pseudorandomly assigned to one of the three possible common elements (i.e., location, people, or objects). The presentation order for the open-loops across encoding blocks 2 and 3 was (1) person\u2013location, location\u2013object; (2) location\u2013object, object\u2013person; and (3) object\u2013person, person\u2013location. The presentation order for the closed-loops across the three encoding blocks was (1) person\u2013location, location\u2013object, object\u2013person; (2) location\u2013object, object\u2013person, person\u2013location; and (3) object\u2013person, person\u2013location, location\u2013object. These counterbalanced orders ensured that the first two encoding trials for open-loops and closed-loops were identical in structure, such that closed-loops only differed in relation to the presentation of a third encoding trial. \n\n\n#### Retrieval \n  \nDuring retrieval, participants performed a six-alternative forced-choice cued-recognition task. On each trial, a cue and six potential targets were presented simultaneously on the screen. The cue was presented in the middle of the screen with the six possible targets; one target and five foils form the same category (e.g., if the target was hammer, the five foils would be other randomly selected objects from the other events, regardless of closed- vs open-loop or delay vs no-delay status) presented in two rows of three below the cue ( ). Participants had a maximum of 6\u2005s to respond with a button response that corresponded to the target position on the screen and were instructed to be as accurate as possible in the time given. The position of the correct target was randomly selected on each retrieval trial. The cue and six targets were presented until a response was made or when the maximum 6\u2005s limit was reached (M response times  \u2009\u00b1\u2009  SD\u2009=\u20092.86\u2005s\u2009\u00b1\u20090.42\u2005s). Missing responses (i.e., responses that fell outside the 6\u2005s response window) were treated as incorrect trials for both accuracy and dependency (M percentage of missing responses  \u2009\u00b1\u2009  SD\u2009=\u20093.54%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.22%). A 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (loop\u2009\u00d7\u2009delay) ANOVA, where the dependent variable was the proportion of missing responses, showed no significant effects (  F  s\u2009<\u20090.37). Thus, any differences in dependency across conditions are unlikely to be caused by assuming missing responses would have been incorrect. Note also that due to the six-alternative forced-choice recognition test, the chance of guessing correctly was relatively low (\u223c16.7%). \n\nEach encoded pairwise association (regardless of delay or loop status) was tested in both directions (e.g., cue, location; target, person; cue, person; target, location) across two scanning runs (total retrieval trials, 360; 180 trials per run). For the open-loops, we only tested the pairwise associations that were directly encoded\u2014and not those that could potentially be inferred from overlapping nature of pairwise associations ( ;  )\u2014resulting in four retrieval trials per open-loop compared with six retrieval trials per closed-loop. The presentation order was optimized to measure the univariate BOLD activity in each of the four within-subject experimental conditions (i.e., open-loop, delay; open-loop, no-delay; closed-loop, delay; closed-loop, no-delay; optimization algorithm available at  ). To avoid adaptation effects, cue\u2013target associations from the same closed- or open-loop were never presented on successive trials, and each block contained 18 null trials that each lasted 6\u2005s. In each retrieval block (or scan run), cue\u2013target associations belonging to nine closed- and open-loops encoded during the first encoding session and nine closed- and nine open-loops encoded immediately before retrieval were tested in a random order, making a total of 180 retrieval trials, in addition to the 18 null trials. Each trial was preceded by a 1\u2005s fixation and followed by a 1\u2005s blank screen. \n\n\n\n### Modeling retrieval dependency \n  \nTo model retrieval dependency, we created 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 contingency tables for the observed data for each participant to assess the proportion of joint retrieval and joint nonretrieval between the retrieval of two elements (e.g., person, object) when cued by a common element (e.g., location; A A ) and between the retrieval of a common element (e.g., location) when cued by the other two elements from the same (e.g., person, object; B C ). For the closed-loops, six contingency tables were constructed (as we test all three pairwise associations in both directions), and for the open-loops, four contingency tables were constructed (as we only tested the two directly encoded pairwise associations in both directions). \n\nWe also constructed contingency tables that estimate the number of trials that would fall into each of the four cells if the retrieval of pairwise associations within an open- or closed-loop was independent. This independent model assumes that pairwise associations from a given event are retrieved independently of one another\u2014that is, if a participant retrieved one pairwise association from an event (un)successfully, this does not predict the participants ability to (un)successfully retrieve another pairwise association from the same event. \n\nThe 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 contingency tables for the data show the number of events that fall within the four cells (i.e., for the A A  analysis, both A  and A  correct, A  incorrect and A  correct; A  correct and A  incorrect; and both A  and A  incorrect, where A \u2009=\u2009cue with location (A) and retrieve person (B) and similarly for A , where C refers to object). The table for the independent model ( ) shows the predicted number of events that fall in the four cells, given a participant\u2019s overall level of accuracy, when the retrieval of within-event associations is assumed to be independent. \n  \nContingency table for the independent model for correct and incorrect retrieval, over   N   events (  i  \u2009=\u20091 to   N  ), for elements B and C when cued by A \n  \nFor a given participant, the proportion of correct retrievals of, for instance, element B when cued by A is denoted by   (i.e., the mean performance for B when cued by A across all events). For the independent model, when cued by A, the probability of (1) correctly retrieving B and C (across all events) is equal to  ; (2) correctly retrieving B but not C is equal to  ; (3) correctly retrieving C but not B is equal to  ; and (4) incorrectly retrieving both B and C is equal to  . \n\nOnce the contingency tables for the data and the independent model were constructed, the proportion of joint retrieval and joint nonretrieval were calculated for each contingency table separately, by summing the leading diagonal cells and dividing by the total number of events (i.e., the proportion of events where two overlapping pairwise associations within an event are both retrieved either correctly or incorrectly). This measure was then averaged across the six or four contingency tables (dependent on whether the tables related to open- or closed-loops) to provide a single measure of the proportion of joint retrieval and nonretrieval for the data and independent model separately. For brevity, we refer to this measure as the \u201cproportion of joint retrieval,\u201d but note that it includes the proportion of both joint retrieval and joint nonretrieval. \n\nThis proportion of joint retrieval measure scales with accuracy. We therefore compare this measure in the data relative to the independent model. As such, the independent model serves as a lower bound that can be compared with the proportion of joint retrieval in the data. We therefore have a single measure of \u201cretrieval dependency\u201d (i.e., the difference between the proportion of joint retrieval in the data relative to the independent model) for each participant and condition. \n\n\n### Behavioral analyses \n  \nA 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (loop\u2009\u00d7\u2009delay) ANOVA was used for the behavioral analysis of retrieval accuracy and retrieval dependency, with the within-subject factor loop referring to whether the events formed closed- or open-loops and delay referring to whether closed- or open-loops were encoded immediately (no-delay) or 24\u2005h prior to retrieval (delay). For the analysis of retrieval dependency, we also report one sample   t   tests comparing retrieval dependency in each condition with zero. Retrieval dependency significantly greater than zero provides evidence for the presence of dependency. Alpha was set to 0.05 (two-tailed) for all statistical tests. For each ANOVA, a   effect size is reported, and for   t   tests we report a Cohen\u2019s   d   effect size reflecting the mean difference between conditions divided by the standard deviation of the difference scores. All analyses were conducted using JASP ( ). \n\n\n### fMRI acquisition \n  \nAll functional and structural volumes were acquired on a 3\u2005T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma scanner equipped with a 64-channel phase array head coil. T2*-weighted slices were acquired with echo-planar imaging (EPI). Forty-eight axial slices (\u223c0\u00b0 tilt to the AC\u2013PC lines) per volume were acquired in an interleaved order with the following parameters: acquisition matrix, 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964; repetition time, 1,200\u2005ms; echo time, 26\u2005ms; flip angle, 75\u00b0; slice thickness, 3\u2005mm; in-plane resolution, 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2005mm; and multiband acceleration factor, 2. To allow for T1 equilibrium, we acquired the first three EPI volumes prior to the task and then discarded them. As the retrieval phase varied in length across participants (as each cued-recognition trial was self-paced, up to a maximum of 6\u2005s per trial), the number of acquired volumes differed across participants. Note that the two retrieval blocks corresponded to two separate functional scanning runs. The mean number of volumes acquired during retrieval was 796.80 (range, 621\u2013955) and 774.04 (range, 616\u2013942) for the first and second retrieval blocks, respectively. A field map was acquired to allow for the correction of geometric distortions due to field inhomogeneities. For the purpose of coregistration and image normalization, a whole-brain T1-weighted structural scan was acquired with a 1\u2005mm  resolution using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo pulse sequence. \n\n\n### fMRI analyses \n  \n#### Preprocessing \n  \nImage preprocessing was performed in SPM12. EPI images were corrected for field inhomogeneity based on geometric distortions and spatially realigned to the first image of the time series. EPI images were spatially normalized to MNI space with transformation parameters derived from warping each participant\u2019s structural image to a T1-weighted average template image (using the DARTEL toolbox;  ). EPI images were spatially smoothed with an isotropic 8\u2005mm FWHM Gaussian kernel prior to analysis. \n\n\n#### General analysis \n  \nAt the first level, BOLD activity was modeled by a boxcar function from cue/target onset to the time a response was made (up to a maximum of 6\u2005s). The predicted BOLD response was then convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function to produce regressors of interest. In addition to the main regressors of interest, all first-level models included a set of nuisance regressors: six movement parameters, their first-order derivatives, and volume exclusion regressors censoring periods of excessive motion. The volume exclusion regressors were defined as volumes where the movement derivatives exceeded 1.5\u2005mm translation (i.e., 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009slice thickness) or 1\u00b0 rotation (M number of excluded volumes\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\u2009=\u20090.79\u2009\u00b1\u20093.60). Parameter estimates for each regressor of interest were included in the second-level analysis to identify consistent effects across participants. Unless otherwise stated, all second-level models explicitly modeled subject effects. All effects reported outside the hippocampus are   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 family-wise error (FWE) whole-brain corrected (cluster size >30 voxels). We also performed small-volume corrected (SVC) analyses in the hippocampus given the a priori predictions related to this brain region. This mask for SVC was created using the WFU PickAtlas toolbox ( ) with the hippocampus defined from the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas ( ). \n\n\n#### Neocortical reinstatement \n  \nThe first-level model included 24 regressors that related to all cue\u2013target pairs (i.e., person\u2013location, person\u2013object, location\u2013person, location\u2013object, object\u2013person, and object\u2013location) for each of the four experimental conditions (open vs closed and delay vs no-delay). At the second level, regions that showed greater BOLD response to cueing and retrieving each element type (i.e., cue/target), relative to when an element type was not cued or required to be retrieved (i.e., nontarget), collapsed across the four experimental conditions were identified. This revealed three separate regions of interest across the three element types ( ). For each region of interest\u2014defined as a 9-mm-radius sphere centered on the peak coordinate\u2014BOLD responses for each individual across all 24 regressors were extracted. The BOLD response when the element associated with a given region was either the cue, target, or nontarget across the four experimental conditions was then calculated. As such, estimates of the BOLD response across 12 conditions (i.e., cue, target, and nontarget\u2009\u00d7\u2009closed- and open-loop\u2009\u00d7\u2009delay and no-delay) were obtained for each of the three regions of interest. \n\n\n#### Nontarget reinstatement and correlated activity \n  \nThe first-level model included four regressors corresponding to trials from each of the four experimental conditions (i.e., open-loop, delay; closed-loop, delay; open-loop, no-delay; and closed-loop, no-delay). At the second level, two separate random-effects models were created, one for the delay and one for the no-delay condition. Each model included a single regressor corresponding to the contrast between closed- and open-loops (i.e., open-loop vs closed-loops for the respective delay or no-delay condition). This was calculated by taking the mean difference in BOLD response between the closed- and open-loop conditions for the nontarget element across the three regions of interest. Given the prior hypothesis regarding the hippocampus, statistical effects in the bilateral hippocampus are   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 FWE SVC within a bilateral hippocampal mask. \n\n\n\n### Data availability \n  \nSecond-level data and analyses are available on the Open Science Framework ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavior \n  \n#### Retrieval accuracy \n  \nMemory performance (proportion correct) across each of the four experimental conditions is presented in  . \n  \nMean proportion correct (and standard deviations) and mean proportion of joint retrieval (and standard deviations) for the data and independent model at no-delay (i.e., encoded immediately prior to retrieval delay) and delay (i.e., encoded 24\u2005h prior to retrieval) for closed- and open-loops \n  \nA 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (loop\u2009\u00d7\u2009delay) ANOVA revealed a significant effect of loop (  F  \u2009=\u200937.72;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;    =\u20090.44) and delay (  F  \u2009=\u200945.74;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;    =\u20090.48), with greater memory for closed-loops, relative to open-loops, and for pairs retrieved immediately after encoding, compared with those retrieved following a 24\u2005h delay. The ANOVA also revealed a significant interaction between these factors (  F  \u2009=\u200910.78;   p  \u2009=\u20090.002;  \u2009=\u20090.18), with a greater difference in memory between closed- and open-loops at delay relative to no-delay. This is consistent with the finding reported in  . \n\n\n#### Retrieval dependency \n  \nThe mean proportion of joint retrieval in the data and independent model, for closed- and open-loops at delay and no-delay, are presented in  .   shows mean retrieval dependency (i.e., data\u2013independent model) for each condition. Evidence for dependency was seen for closed-loops at both delay (  t  \u2009=\u20097.83;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20091.11) and no-delay (  t  \u2009=\u20095.03;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20090.71). No evidence for dependency was observed for open-loops at delay (  t  \u2009=\u20090.63;   p  \u2009=\u20090.533;   d  \u2009=\u20090.10); however, we did find evidence for dependency for open-loops at no-delay (  t  \u2009=\u20092.19;   p  \u2009=\u20090.033;   d  \u2009=\u20090.31; but this effect did not survive corrections for multiple comparisons; adjusted   \u03b1   for four comparisons\u2009=\u20090.013;  , though we note the smaller effect size estimate (0.31) relative to the two closed-loop conditions (1.11 and 0.71). \n  \nDependency for closed- and open-loops at no-delay (i.e., encoded immediately prior to retrieval) and delay (i.e., encoded 24\u2005h prior to retrieval).

Whiskers represent the minimum and maximum data points. ns, not significant, ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001, *  p  \u2009<\u20090.05. \n  \nA 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 (loop\u2009\u00d7\u2009delay) ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of loop (  F  \u2009=\u200912.33;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;  \u2009=\u20090.20), where dependency was greater for closed- compared with that for open-loops. However, this analysis also revealed a significant interaction (  F  \u2009=\u20095.21;   p  \u2009=\u20090.027;  \u2009=\u20090.10), driven by a greater difference between closed- and open-loops at delay (  t  \u2009=\u20095.03;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20090.71) relative to no-delay (  t  \u2009=\u20091.13;   p  \u2009=\u20090.265;   d  \u2009=\u20090.16). Thus, we replicate previous findings showing greater dependency in the closed-loop delay than that in the open-loop delay condition but unexpectedly did not see the same pattern in the no-delay condition. Despite this, a direct comparison between the delay and no-delay open-loop conditions was not significant (  t  \u2009=\u20091.49;   p  \u2009=\u20090.142;   d  \u2009=\u20090.21) or between the delay and no-delay closed-loop condition (  t  \u2009=\u20091.91;   p  \u2009=\u20090.062;   d  \u2009=\u20090.27). There was no main effect of delay in this analysis (  F  \u2009=\u20090.04;   p  \u2009=\u20090.842;  \u2009<\u20090.01). \n\nThe finding of dependency in the open-loop delay condition was unexpected given the previous studies have not found evidence for dependency for open-loops in an immediate test condition ( ;  ;  ). One possibility is that the two encoding sessions in the present study [cf.   who had a single encoding session and two separate retrieval sessions] allowed participants to infer the associative nature of the overlapping pairs in the first encoding session (i.e., delay), leading to increases in dependency for open-loops encoded during the second encoding session (i.e., no-delay). However, it is important to note that dependency is seen for closed-loops at both delay and no-delay (i.e., it is the open-loop, no-delay condition that appears to diverge from previous findings). \n\n\n\n### fMRI \n  \n#### Neocortical reinstatement \n  \nTo look for differences in reinstatement as a function of loop or delay, we first identified regions where BOLD activity differed between the retrieval of different element types (i.e., people, locations, and objects), collapsed across the closed- versus open-loop and delay versus no-delay conditions. For example, to identify regions associated with the retrieval of people, we compared retrieval trials where a person was either a cue or target with trials where a person was neither the cue nor the target (i.e., the nontarget). The largest difference in the BOLD activity for people was seen in the precuneus, for locations in the left parahippocampal gyrus, and for objects in the left middle temporal gyrus ( ,  ). Thus, as in  , people, locations, and objects produced different levels of activation in specific neocortical regions. Unthresholded statistical maps of these effects are available at  . \n  \n  A   , Cortical regions showing activation differences for people, locations, and objects.    B   , Mean difference (collapsed across the precuneus, left parahippocampal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus) in the BOLD activity for closed- versus open-loops for cue (dark gray), target (light gray), and nontarget (white) trials at no-delay, no delay (when using the open-loop condition at delay as baseline; highlighted with gray, transparent box), and delay. Lines in boxes represent mean difference in each condition. Bottom and top edges of boxes indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. Whiskers represent the minimum and maximum data points. ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001, corrected for multiple comparisons. \n    \nClusters and peaks showing element-specific whole-brain activity for people, locations, and objects (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05; cluster size >30) \n    \nBOLD responses from these regions were then extracted and assessed in terms of how they differed depending on whether the element associated with that region was either a cue, target, or nontarget (e.g., a trial where an object was the cue and a location was the target would be a nontarget trial for people). If closed-loops are reinstated holistically (regardless of delay), the region associated with the nontarget (e.g., the precuneus for people) should show greater activity for closed- relative to open-loops (as nontarget reinstatement is not expected to occur for open-loops). \n\nWe first tested whether we saw a nontarget reinstatement effect, collapsing across the delay and no-delay condition and all three ROIs. This revealed significantly greater BOLD activity for closed- than open-loops in the nontarget region (  t  \u2009=\u20096.02;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20090.85). We also saw significantly greater BOLD response for closed- than that for open-loops in the cue region (  t  \u2009=\u20092.92;   p  \u2009=\u20090.005;   d  \u2009=\u20090.41) but not the target region (  t  \u2009=\u20090.61;   p  \u2009=\u20090.542;   d  \u2009=\u20090.09; adjusted   \u03b1   for three comparisons\u2009=\u20090.017). We therefore provide evidence for nontarget reinstatement as seen in the previous studies ( ;  ). \n\nWe next tested whether the nontarget reinstatement effect differed between the delay and no-delay conditions ( ). This revealed that the BOLD activity for closed- relative to open-loops in the nontarget region was significantly greater in the delay than that in the no-delay condition (  t  \u2009=\u20094.65;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20090.66). Interestingly, although we saw significantly greater BOLD activity for closed- than that for open-loops in the nontarget region at delay (  t  \u2009=\u20098.60;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20091.22; adjusted   \u03b1   for two comparisons\u2009=\u20090.025), no difference was seen in the no-delay condition (  t  \u2009=\u20091.89;   p  \u2009=\u20090.064;   d  \u2009=\u20090.27), even though we note that the numerical difference is in the same direction. \n\nFor completeness, we also tested for differences between closed- and open-loops in the cue and target regions in the delay and no-delay conditions. No differences between closed- and open-loops were seen in the cue region, delay (  t  \u2009=\u20092.42;   p  \u2009=\u20090.020;   d  \u2009=\u20090.34) and no-delay (  t  \u2009=\u20092.01;   p  \u2009=\u20090.050;   d  \u2009=\u20090.29), or the target region, delay (  t  \u2009=\u20091.76;   p  \u2009=\u20090.084;   d  \u2009=\u20090.25) and no-delay (  t  \u2009=\u20090.84;   p  \u2009=\u20090.405;   d  \u2009=\u20090.12; adjusted   \u03b1   for four comparisons\u2009=\u20090.013). \n\n Previous studies ( ;  ) have observed a nontarget reinstatement effect for closed-loops retrieved immediately after encoding, and as such the failure to replicate this effect was unexpected. However, the absence of a difference between closed- and open-loops at no-delay is perhaps consistent with the lack of a significant behavioral difference in dependency between closed- and open-loops at no-delay. Given that we observed evidence of dependency for open-loops at no-delay, it is possible that this open-loop condition is obscuring a possible nontarget reinstatement effect in the closed-loop condition. To assess this possibility, we first directly compared the BOLD response in the delay and no-delay conditions for the open-loop and closed-loop conditions separately. This revealed significantly greater BOLD activity in the open-loop, no-delay than that in the delay condition in the nontarget region (  t  \u2009=\u20094.55;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20090.64; adjusted   \u03b1   for six comparisons\u2009=\u20090.008), consistent with the possibility that participants are reinstating nontarget elements more often in the open-loop, no delay than delay condition. Apart from significantly greater BOLD activity in the closed-loop, no-delay than that in the delay condition in the target region (  t  \u2009=\u20093.24;   p  \u2009=\u20090.002;   d  \u2009=\u20090.46), no further comparisons were significant (  t  s\u2009<\u20091.65;   p  s\u2009>\u20090.0105). \n\nGiven evidence that the BOLD activity in the open-loop, no-delay condition differed from the open-loop, delay condition in the nontarget region, alongside the behavioral evidence for dependency in the open-loop, no-delay condition, it is possible that this condition is not serving as an appropriate baseline for comparison with the closed-loop, no-delay condition. Given the lack of dependency in the open-loop, delay condition, we reasoned this might be a more appropriate baseline for assessing nontarget reinstatement in the no-delay condition. \n\nThe comparisons between the closed-loop, no-delay and open-loop, delay conditions revealed that the BOLD activity was significantly greater for nontarget closed-loops relative to open-loops (  t  \u2009=\u20095.33;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20090.76; adjusted   \u03b1   for three comparisons\u2009=\u20090.017;  ). There was also a significant difference for cue (  t  \u2009=\u20093.74;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   d  \u2009=\u20090.53), but not target trials when corrected for multiple comparisons (  t  \u2009=\u20092.19;   p  \u2009=\u20090.034;   d  \u2009=\u20090.31). Thus, when we use a baseline in which we did not find evidence of behavioral dependency for open-loops (i.e., the open-loop delay condition), we see evidence for nontarget reinstatement for closed-loops in both the delay and no-delay conditions. \n\nWe therefore provide evidence for nontarget reinstatement in the closed-loop delay and no-delay condition, although the effect at no-delay is only seen in a post hoc analysis using the open-loop delay condition as a baseline measure. Critically, this post hoc analysis does not affect the clear finding of nontarget reinstatement following a 24\u2005h delay (including a night of sleep). \n\n\n#### Nontarget reinstatement and correlated activity \n  \nThe above analyses provided evidence for nontarget neocortical reinstatement in the closed-loop relative to open-loop condition after a 24\u2005h delay. This is consistent with behavioral evidence showing that closed-loops retain their coherence, as measured by retrieval dependency, following a delay ( ). \n\nPrevious work has shown that the strength of nontarget reinstatement correlated with the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast across participants ( ). This is consistent with the proposal that hippocampal pattern completion drives the reinstatement of all associated elements in the neocortex. To assess whether the role of hippocampal pattern completion differs over time, we correlated the nontarget reinstatement effect (closed- vs open-loops) with the difference in the BOLD activity between the closed- and open-loop condition across participants ( ), separately for the no-delay and delay conditions. Note, for this analysis, we used the open-loop, no-delay condition as the baseline measure for the closed-loop, no-delay condition, despite this contrast not providing clear evidence for nontarget reinstatement in the primary analysis. \n\nAt both delay and no-delay, multiple brain regions that have previously been associated with recollection, including the hippocampus (see  ;  ;   for reviews), correlated with the difference in nontarget reinstatement between closed- and open-loops on a whole-brain level ( ). Within the bilateral hippocampal mask (  p   \u2009  <\u20090.05), we observed differences in BOLD activity for nontarget trials that correlated with the closed- versus open-loop contrast at both the delay and no-delay conditions ( ). We therefore provide evidence that nontarget reinstatement correlates with the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast in both the no-delay and delay conditions. Unthresholded statistical maps of these effects are available at  . \n  \nClusters and peaks showing whole-brain regions and clusters within a bilateral hippocampal mask, correlating with differences in the cortical activity for nontarget trials between closed- and open-loops at delay and no-delay (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05; cluster size >5) \n      \nClusters and peaks showing regions within the bilateral hippocampal mask correlating with differences in the cortical activity for nontarget trials between closed- and open-loops at delay and no-delay (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05; cluster defining threshold at the whole-brain level   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; cluster extent threshold >5 voxels) \n    \nWe also performed a second analysis to assess the relationship between nontarget reinstatement and the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast. We first identified regions within the hippocampal mask that showed greater BOLD activity for closed- relative to open-loops (collapsed across delay and no-delay and all retrieval trials). This revealed a region in the left hippocampus (peak, \u221221, \u221236, 3) at an uncorrected threshold (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001) (unthresholded statistical map of this effect is available at  ). We then extracted the difference between closed- and open-loops in this functionally defined region for each participant and correlated this difference with the difference in the neocortical nontarget activity between closed- and open-loops. Consistent with the whole-brain and SVC analyses reported above, we saw that the activity from the closed- versus open-loop contrast in the hippocampus correlated with participants\u2019 nontarget reinstatement at both no-delay [  r  \u2009=\u20090.68;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; and when using the open-loop delay condition as baseline for the closed-loop condition at no-delay (  r  \u2009=\u20090.66;   p\u2009  <\u20090.001)] and delay (  r  \u2009=\u20090.43;   p  \u2009=\u20090.002) conditions. \n\nAs a next step, to assess whether the relationship between the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast and nontarget reinstatement differed at no-delay and delay, we again extracted the difference between closed- and open-loops (collapsed across all retrieval trials) in the functionally defined hippocampal region identified above for each participant, as well as the mean difference in neocortical nontarget activity between closed- and open-loops. We then used a generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) to estimate the strength of neocortical reinstatement (i.e., differences in neocortical nontarget activity between closed- and open-loops), incorporating fixed effects of delay (i.e., no-delay vs delay), the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast (i.e., difference in hippocampal activity between closed- and open-loops), and their interaction, along with random effects of participant and delay for each participant. Note that the fixed effects specify predictors of interest, while the random effects account for statistical dependency between within-participant observations. \n\nConsistent with the correlation analyses, the GLMM revealed significant effects of the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast on the strength of nontarget reinstatement in both the no-delay (  t  \u2009=\u20096.49;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001) and delay (  t  \u2009=\u20093.43;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001; adjusted   \u03b1   for six comparisons\u2009=\u20090.008) conditions. We also saw that the slope of this effect of the hippocampal contrast on nontarget reinstatement did not differ significantly between delay and no-delay conditions (  t  \u2009=\u20091.62;   p  \u2009=\u20090.11). As such, the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast is predictive of nontarget reinstatement in both the no-delay and delay conditions, and we see no evidence for a difference across delay. \n\nCritically, the GLMM revealed that the intercepts differed significantly across delay (  t  \u2009=\u20094.78;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). While the intercept at no-delay did not differ from zero (  t  \u2009=\u20091.32;   p  \u2009=\u20090.189), the intercept for the delay condition was significantly greater than zero (  t  \u2009=\u20096.82;   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;  . This is critical as it demonstrates that, although the hippocampal closed- versus open-loop contrast correlated with nontarget reinstatement at both time points, the reinstatement effect can occur without evidence for a corresponding difference between closed- and open-loops in the hippocampus at delay. Given that this hippocampal contrast is likely a marker of hippocampal pattern completion ( ), this suggests that nontarget reinstatement can be driven, in an additive manner, by both hippocampal pattern completion and a nonhippocampal process following a 24\u2005h delay between encoding and retrieval. \n  \n  A   , Correlation between the difference in the hippocampal activity during the retrieval of closed- versus open-loops (hippocampal ROI defined as a 9-mm-radius sphere centered on the peak coordinate from the closed- vs open-loop contrast peak, \u221221, \u221236, and 3) and the mean difference (collapsed across the precuneus, left parahippocampal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus for people, locations, and objects, respectively) in the BOLD activity during nontarget retrieval for closed- versus open-loops, separately for events retrieved after no-delay (left) and delay (right).    B   , Mean GLMM estimates (and 95% confidence intervals) for intercept (left) and slope (right) for the no-delay (dark gray) and delay (light gray) conditions. ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001; ns, not significant. \n  \nTo assess the robustness of these effects, we reran the GLMM analysis while removing a randomly selected subset of participants at each analysis point from   n  \u2009=\u20091 to   n  \u2009=\u200920. For each of these analyses, we iteratively repeated the analysis 50 times and removed a randomly selected subset of participants for each iteration. The robustness analysis showed that the significant intercept difference from zero in the delay condition was present in every iteration, as well as the significant difference in the intercept between the no-delay and delay condition being present in every iteration. The nonsignificant differences in the slope between the no-delay and delay conditions were more variable, decreasing below 90% consistency with the main analysis at   n  \u2009=\u20099, with a mean consistency of 83% between   n  \u2009=\u20099 and   n  \u2009=\u200920 and a minimum consistency of 70% at   n  \u2009=\u200920. Thus, the results of our novel GLMM approach to assessing the relationship between hippocampal pattern completion and nontarget neocortical reinstatement are robust to the random removal of data points to at least   n  \u2009=\u20099 (i.e., a total   N   of \u223c40). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe show that events, composed of three overlapping pairs (i.e., closed-loops), continue to be reinstated holistically following a 24\u2005h period of forgetting and consolidation. Although memory performance decreased over time (indicating that forgetting had occurred), we continued to observe the BOLD activity related to the reinstatement of elements incidental to retrieval (i.e., nontargets). For example, when participants were cued with a location (e.g., kitchen) and asked to retrieve the overlapping object (e.g., hammer), retrieval also led to the activity in the cortical regions associated with the overlapping person (e.g., Barack Obama), despite no explicit demand to retrieve this element (i.e., the element was neither the cue nor the retrieval target). Importantly, the level of this nontarget reinstatement effect at delay was equivalent to that seen for closed-loops retrieved immediately after encoding (when using the open-loop condition at delay as baseline). This is consistent with behavioral evidence for \u201cholistic forgetting\u201d where events retain their coherence over periods of forgetting ( ). \n\nThe reinstatement of nontarget elements is thought to be a direct consequence of pattern completion in the hippocampus ( ), whereby a partial input can result in the retrieval of the complete memory. We show that the strength of the nontarget reinstatement effect correlates with a signature of hippocampal pattern completion (hippocampal closed- vs open-loop contrast) before and after a 24\u2005h delay. However, although the slope of this relationship did not statistically differ across delay, the intercept significantly increased and was statistically greater than zero at delay. Although this novel analysis and finding appears to be robust to the removal of random participants (at least to   N  \u2009=\u20099 participants), it is nonetheless important that they should be replicated in an independent data set in the future. Our results suggest that hippocampal pattern completion still contributes to the strength of this effect after delay; however, some nontarget reinstatement can occur without a corresponding signature of hippocampal pattern completion following a 24\u2005h delay. This latter finding points to an emergent nonhippocampal contribution to holistic reinstatement. \n\nIt has long been proposed that the role of the hippocampus in long-term memory retrieval changes over time ( ;  ). This proposal is motivated by observations that although patients with hippocampal damage present with amnesia ( ;  ), they often show a temporal gradient to their deficit, with memory for remote events being relatively spared compared with the more recent ones ( ;  ). \n\nStandard theories of consolidation have argued that the sparse activity patterns and high neural density of the hippocampus provide the ideal mechanisms for the initial encoding and retrieval of event-based representations ( ;  ;  ). However, over periods of consolidation, gradual adjustments to cortical connections are thought to allow for the formation of neocortical representations that can be retrieved independent of the hippocampus ( ). Although standard theories of consolidation have noted that this process can be relatively protracted occurring over days, weeks, or months, there is evidence that differences in the hippocampal activity at retrieval already emerge after a 1\u2005d interval ( ,  ). \n\nConsistent with these findings, we found a difference in the intercept between the no-delay and delay conditions when estimating the relationship between neocortical reinstatement and hippocampal pattern completion. While the intercept did not differ from zero in the no-delay condition, it was significantly greater than zero in the delay condition (and the intercepts significantly differed between conditions). The nonzero intercept suggests that neocortical reinstatement can occur without evidence for a corresponding signature of hippocampal pattern completion following a 24\u2005h period of consolidation. However, our results also show that while the neocortical reinstatement of nontarget elements can be achieved without a corresponding increment in hippocampal pattern completion, the hippocampus still contributes to the strength of this reinstatement effect. As such, while consolidation may allow for the strengthening of related neocortical representations that can be holistically reinstated independently of hippocampal pattern completion\u2014consistent with standard theories of consolidation\u2014pattern completion continues to mediate the strength to which events are holistically reinstated after a 24\u2005h delay. \n\nCritically, these two contributions to holistic neocortical reinstatement appear to be additive in nature; the total amount of reinstatement is the sum of the linear relationship between hippocampal pattern completion and reinstatement and the additional nonhippocampal contribution (at least after 24\u2005h). This suggests that the relationship is not compensatory in nature\u2014it is not the case that as one contribution increases, the other decreases. \n\nOne critical question is whether this pattern is consistent across further delays. It is possible that the hippocampal contribution decreases over longer timescales, which would be reflected in a decrease in the slope of the estimated relationship over time. Such a result would support standard consolidation theories; however, it would point to a more additive relationship during the consolidation process, with hippocampal pattern completion continuing to contribute to the reinstatement of past events even in the presence of a nonhippocampal contribution to retrieval. Indeed, our approach potentially allows for the tracking of independent time courses, where the contribution of hippocampal pattern completion might decrease over time at a different rate relative to the emergence of the nonhippocampal process and that these different time courses might be driven by different mechanisms. For example, the increase in the nonhippocampal process might be driven by active systems consolidation processes during sleep ( ), whereas the decreased contribution of hippocampal pattern completion might be a function of forgetting via decay mechanisms ( ;  ). Tracking the time course of changes to the slope and intercept of the hippocampal pattern completion\u2013neocortical reinstatement relationship over different delays (from one day to several weeks) could assess this possibility. \n\nAlternative accounts of consolidation, such as the multiple trace theory ( ) and trace transformation theory ( ;  ), make a distinction between the maintenance and retrieval of fine-grained, or context-rich, information and more gist-like information surrounding a memory. These distinct representations have been proposed to be represented independently, with the former being more dependent on the hippocampus and the latter on the neocortex. Support for this distinction has come from evidence showing that peripheral details are forgotten more rapidly than gist-like information from an event ( ) and evidence showing that memory for context-rich information of an event (but not gist-like information) tends to be impaired following hippocampal damage ( ). \n\nOur findings may represent an intermediate between standard theories of consolidation and these alternative accounts, where the direct involvement of hippocampal pattern completion in recollection endures, insofar as hippocampal pattern completion still contributes to the strength or precision of reinstatement, despite the emergence of a nonhippocampal contribution to retrieval. Harlow and colleagues ( :  ) have argued that recollection may be characterized by two potentially separable memory components: \u201caccessibility\u201d (i.e., the probability of successful retrieval) and \u201cprecision\u201d (i.e., the precision/fidelity of the successfully retrieved information). As such, it is possible that the strength (or precision) of reinstatement is reflective of a more continuous retrieval process, such that even in instances where an entire event is successfully reinstated in the neocortex, the fidelity of reinstatement may differ across events, and this may depend on the involvement of the hippocampus ( ;  ;  ). Whereas some initial (less precise) neocortical reinstatement could occur without hippocampal pattern completion following a delay, further (more precise, detailed) reinstatement could still require pattern completion. This would predict that when retrieving context-rich information, the hippocampal\u2013neocortical relationship should be maintained over delay; however, when retrieving more gist-like information, the relationship should decrease over delay. Assessing memory for the perceptual versus semantic features of multiple event elements across delay could address this possibility. \n\nIn sum, we provide evidence for holistic reinstatement following a period of forgetting and consolidation. This is consistent with previous behavioral evidence suggesting that event-based memories undergo a holistic form of forgetting where events that are retained continue to be retrieved in their entirety and events that are forgotten are forgotten in their entirety. Critically, we found evidence that holistic reinstatement in the neocortex is driven by both hippocampal pattern completion and a nonhippocampal process after 24\u2005h. Further, our novel experimental approach allows us to independently assess both hippocampal and nonhippocampal contributions to reinstatement, allowing future research to track the time courses of these potentially independent contributions. Finally, our results show that holistic retrieval is driven by both a nonhippocampal process and hippocampal pattern completion after 24\u2005h, suggesting that the hippocampus and neocortex work in an additive, rather than compensatory, manner to support episodic memory retrieval. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1.\nRetrieval of element C\tRetrieval of element B\tRetrieval of element B\nRetrieval of element C\tCorrect (PAB)\tIncorrect (1\u2212PAB)\nCorrect (PAC)\t\u2211i=1N=PABiPACi\t\u2211i=1N=PACi(1\u2212PABi)\nIncorrect (1\u2212PAC)\t\u2211i=1N=PABi(1\u2212PACi)\t\u2211i=1N=(1\u2212PABi)(1\u2212PACi)\n### Caption\nContingency table for the independent model for correct and incorrect retrieval, over N events (i\u2009=\u20091 to N), for elements B and C when cued by A\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: T2\n### Label: Table 2.\nDelay\tLoop\tProportion correct\tProportion of joint retrieval\tProportion of joint retrieval\nDelay\tLoop\tProportion correct\tData\tIndependent model\nNo-delay\tOpen\t0.62 (0.19)\t0.61 (0.14)\t0.59 (0.12)\nNo-delay\tClosed\t0.68 (0.21)\t0.69 (0.14)\t0.65 (0.14)\nDelay\tOpen\t0.50 (0.19)\t0.56 (0.13)\t0.55 (0.11)\nDelay\tClosed\t0.61 (0.21)\t0.67 (0.12)\t0.61 (0.13)\n### Caption\nMean proportion correct (and standard deviations) and mean proportion of joint retrieval (and standard deviations) for the data and independent model at no-delay (i.e., encoded immediately prior to retrieval delay) and delay (i.e., encoded 24\u2005h prior to retrieval) for closed- and open-loops\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: T3\n### Label: Table 3.\nRegion\tVoxels\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tMNI coordinates\tZ score\nRegion\tVoxels\tX\tY\tZ\tZ score\nPeople\tPeople\tPeople\tPeople\tPeople\tPeople\nPrecuneus cortex\t450\t3\t\u221257\t27\t>8\nL lingual gyrus\t1,163\t\u221215\t\u221290\t\u22123\t>8\nFrontal medial cortex\t368\t\u22123\t48\t\u22129\t>8\nL middle temporal gyrus\t158\t\u221263\t\u22126\t\u221215\t>8\nR middle temporal gyrus\t56\t63\t\u22123\t\u221218\t>8\nSuperior frontal gyrus\t61\t\u22126\t57\t30\t7.80\nLocations\tLocations\tLocations\tLocations\tLocations\tLocations\nL parahippocampal gyrus\t270\t\u221227\t\u221236\t\u221215\t>8\nL lateral occipital cortex\t276\t\u221239\t\u221281\t33\t>8\nR precuneus\t423\t15\t\u221248\t9\t>8\nR parahippocampal gyrus\t159\t27\t\u221230\t\u221218\t>8\nR lateral occipital cortex\t71\t48\t\u221272\t30\t7.67\nR cingulate gyrus\t41\t\u22123\t\u221236\t42\t5.97\nL middle temporal gyrus\t48\t\u221257\t\u221251\t\u22129\t5.97\nL superior frontal gyrus\t40\t\u221224\t12\t54\t5.65\nObjects\tObjects\tObjects\tObjects\tObjects\tObjects\nL middle temporal gyrus\t195\t\u221251\t\u221254\t0\t7.80\nL frontal pole\t30\t\u221248\t39\t12\t5.63\n### Caption\nClusters and peaks showing element-specific whole-brain activity for people, locations, and objects (pFWE\u2009<\u20090.05;

The study of the neural correlates of involuntary memories of stressful events in PTSD focuses on the voluntary retrieval of memories that are sometimes recalled as intrusive involuntary memories, not on involuntary retrieval while being scanned. Involuntary memory retrieval in controls has been shown to elicit activity in the parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, inferior parietal cortex, and posterior midline regions. However, it is unknown whether involuntary memories are supported by the same mechanisms in PTSD. Because previous work has shown that both behavioral and neural responsivity is slowed in PTSD, we examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of the neural activity underlying negative and neutral involuntary memory retrieval. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nTwenty-one individuals with PTSD and 21 non-PTSD, trauma-exposed controls performed an involuntary memory task, while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Environmental sounds served as cues for well-associated pictures of negative and neutral scenes. We used a finite impulse response model to analyze temporal differences between groups in neural responses. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCompared with controls, participants with PTSD reported more involuntary memories, which were more emotional and more vivid, but which activated a similar network of regions. However, compared to controls, individuals with PTSD showed delayed neural responsivity in this network and increased vmPFC/ACC activity for negative\u202f>\u202fneutral stimuli. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe similarity between PTSD and controls in neural substrates underlying involuntary memories suggests that, unlike voluntary memories, involuntary memories elicit similar activity in regions critical for memory retrieval. Further, the delayed neural responsivity for involuntary memories in PTSD suggests that factors affecting cognition in PTSD, like increased fatigue, or avoidance behaviors could do so by delaying activity in regions necessary for cognitive processing. Finally, compared to neutral memories, negative involuntary memories elicit hyperactivity in the vmPFC, whereas the vmPFC is typically shown to be hypoactive in PTSD during voluntary memory retrieval. These patterns suggest that considering both the temporal dynamics of cognitive processes as well as involuntary cognitive processes would improve existing neurobiological models of PTSD. \n\n   Highlights  \n  \nWe conducted the first fMRI study of involuntary memory (IM) retrieval in PTSD. \n  \nActivity in IM regions was similar in PTSD and control groups but delayed in PTSD. \n  \nActivity in the vmPFC was higher in PTSD\u202f>\u202fcontrols for negative\u202f>\u202fneutral IMs. \n  \nPeople with PTSD had more IMs than controls. \n  \nModels of PTSD would benefit from studies of the timing of neural responsivity. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nInvoluntary episodic memories are explicit memories of past events that can be described by the rememberer, but are not preceded by a retrieval attempt ( ). Involuntary memories are assumed to be critical for maintaining a sense of continuity of self across time and for giving fast access to memories that may have functional relevance in novel situations ( ). They occur at least as frequently as their voluntary counterparts ( ;  ), and they are viewed as a basic mode of remembering, operating on the same system as voluntary memories ( ). \n\nInvoluntary memories of a traumatic event are a hallmark symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD;  ), with intrusive memories being present in almost 90% of individuals with PTSD ( ). Past research indicates the frequency of these intrusive memories\u2014and especially associated responses such as negative reinterpretations, a strong sense of reliving, and maladaptive emotional reactions to the memories\u2014correlates highly with PTSD severity (e.g.,  ). Little is known about the neural underpinnings of the retrieval of involuntary memory. This paucity of research stands in marked contrast with the fact that in clinical disorders, such as PTSD, involuntary memories often become disruptive and distressing. Despite their centrality to the disorder, the basic cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying both emotional and non-emotional involuntary memories in PTSD are not well understood. \n\nWe were able to identify four studies that specifically addressed the neural basis of intrusive involuntary memories of stressful events. Two of these studies used a prospective design with healthy individuals to examine whether neural activity during the encoding of stressful stimuli would predict the reporting of involuntary intrusive memories of this material during a subsequent diary study. Both reported increased activity in limbic regions, including the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), striatum, thalamus, and parahippocampal gyrus, with such increased activity during the encoding of stressful films subsequently reported as flashbacks ( ), and during encoding in individuals reporting a high level of intrusions ( ). Neither of these studies examined neural activation during retrieval. \n\n had PTSD patients and controls provide a narrative account of their trauma or most distressing event before the scan. During the scan they conducted a recognition task in which they were asked to identify keywords culled from their own trauma narrative versus keywords derived from other participants' narratives. Outside the scanner, the participants subsequently identified which of the keywords had led to flashback experiences during the scan and which led to ordinary episodic memories.   found that flashbacks versus episodic recollections were associated with increased neural activity in the sensory and motor areas. However, since a voluntary autobiographical recognition task generated both types of memories, the neural activity did not target involuntary retrieval per se. \n\n examined involuntary retrieval of emotional film clips in healthy participants while they were at rest. The participants indicated that they had an involuntary memory from the film clip by pressing a button. In contrast to other work examining the neural underpinnings of involuntary memories in healthy individuals (e.g.,  ),   found that involuntary retrieval elicited activity in frontal regions. This finding may reflect that the memory recording necessarily involved a source monitoring judgment to decide whether a memory \u2018popping into mind\u2019 matched what had been seen in the film clip or not, since only involuntary memories related to the film clips should be reported. Thus, the frontal activity may be due to making this judgment, which might involve a voluntary search process and related cognitive control processes. We designed our task to address this issue by using retrospective report to determine when involuntary memories occur ( ). We also expand on this work by including individuals with PTSD and comparing negative to neutral involuntary memories. \n\nOutside the clinical literature, a few studies examined brain activity during involuntary memory retrieval.   compared voluntary and involuntary memories of scenes cued by environmental sounds to mimic the kinds of cues and memories that often occur during everyday life ( ;  ;  ). Both voluntary and involuntary memories elicited activity in regions typically found to be active during visual voluntary memory retrieval, including the parahippocampal gyrus, posterior midline regions like the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and retrosplenial cortex, precuneus, and inferior parietal cortex (IPC). However, involuntary memory retrieval did not elicit activity in frontal cortices, likely reflecting the lack of effort involved in such retrieval ( ). \n\nTo our knowledge, no studies addressing the neural underpinnings of involuntary memories in PTSD have used a methodology that does not include the voluntary retrieval of a memory during the scan either to rate directly or to compare with a memory that has come involuntarily. The goal of the present study was to fill this gap in the literature. We wanted to examine the neural activations associated with involuntary memory processing in PTSD in general and not specifically for traumatic events. Developing a deeper understanding of such general processing deficits is relevant because, among other things, diagnostic inclusion criteria for PTSD include a general enhancement of negative affect that is not limited to trauma-relevant material. In particular, this includes difficulty experiencing positive affect, decreased interest in activities, and overly negative thoughts or assumptions about oneself or the world ( ). \n\nInvoluntary memories in PTSD compared to non-PTSD participants, irrespective of their trauma-relevance, involve greater emotionality and are more central to the life story ( ;  ,  ). Also, there is evidence of broad emotion regulation deficits in PTSD beyond traumatic material. Individuals with PTSD have abnormal responses to non-trauma-related negative stimuli, including increased self-reported emotion ( ;  ;  ) and enhanced neural activity to non-trauma-related stimuli ( ;  ;  ). Our focus on the broad emotion processing deficit in PTSD is consistent with an increasing emphasis in the PTSD literature on dysfunctional emotion regulation processes across a range of contexts, and not simply in response to the traumatic event per se (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ). Because of this aim we used the same paradigm as  , and developed in our previous work ( ;  ), but varied the emotionality of the scenes. \n\nVoluntary retrieval of scenes, such as those we used here, is commonly used in studies of involuntary memories in healthy individuals ( ;  ). They elicit activity in a well-characterized network of regions including the parahippocampal gyrus, the inferior and superior parietal cortices, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (for reviews, see  ;  ). In previous work, we showed activity in a subset of these regions for involuntary memory retrieval ( ): the parahippocampal gyrus, thought to underlie successful retrieval, making contributions to scene and context memory ( ), the inferior parietal cortex, thought to be involved in bottom-up (i.e., non-goal-driven, or source-driven) attention to memory ( ;  ) and posterior midline regions like the posterior cingulate cortex, a key region in the default mode network, which has been associated with self-referential thought ( ;  ;  ;  ) and the precuneus, which has been associated with visual imagery ( ). There may be an additional anterior/posterior dissociation within the inferior parietal cortex, with anterior regions being involved in attention reorienting and posterior regions being associated with the default mode network ( ). Other regions not found to be active during involuntary memory retrieval ( ) are regions thought to be involved in top-down processes that are less likely to be invoked when retrieval is involuntary. The dorsolateral PFC is thought to be involved in memory search and maintenance ( ). The superior parietal cortex underlies top-down, goal-driven attention to memory ( ;  ). The differential and common activity in the superior and inferior parietal cortices, respectively, in voluntary and involuntary retrieval illustrates the dissociation in top-down versus bottom-up cognitive processes used during these two types of retrieval. These top-down processes allow for the maintenance of retrieval goals and may be more engaged during low-confidence memory retrieval in an attempt to retrieve additional details of a weak memory, whereas bottom-up processes are particularly engaged when the memory is salient ( ). Though these processes are thought to exist in two dimensions, they interact. Bottom-up processes can occur during voluntary memories and top-down processes can occur during involuntary memories. \n\nTo examine the neural activations associated with involuntary memory processing in PTSD generally, we did not intentionally select scenes that were trauma-relevant for each participant. Critically, participants did not indicate when they had an involuntary memory during the task because doing so would likely invoke top-down processes that would not typically occur during naturalistic involuntary remembering ( ) and would produce neural activity common to voluntary retrieval tasks. We also examined the specific time course for the neural activations, following up on previous work. Because retrieval in our task and in autobiographical memory can take seconds, we used fMRI to study the time course of retrieval, which allowed us to track the time course of neural processes ( ;  ). Investigating differences in the time course of neural processes is critical in PTSD because previous work indicates such differences in neural activity during memory retrieval ( ) and in response time during reflexive, involuntary processing in PTSD ( ;  ). Below, we present whole-brain results but with a theoretical focus on what we refer to as the involuntary memory network, derived from previous work on non-emotional involuntary memories, which includes the MTL, the precuneus, IPC, and posterior midline regions, as well as on emotion-processing regions consisting of the amygdala and the vmPFC. \n\n\n## Materials & methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFifty-seven participants (35 women, mean age\u202f=\u202f21.9\u202fyears, range\u202f=\u202f18\u201337\u202fyears) completed the scan session. Participants gave written informed consent for a protocol approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board and the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. All participants had an A1 trauma in which they were exposed to death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence ( ). After excluding participants who did not meet inclusion criteria (see Supplemental materials) there were 21 participants in the PTSD group (15 women, mean age\u202f=\u202f21.5\u202fyears, range\u202f=\u202f18\u201331\u202fyears) and 21 in the trauma-exposed control group (14 women, mean age\u202f=\u202f22.1\u202fyears, range\u202f=\u202f18\u201337\u202fyears). Additional demographic and clinical data are shown in   and described in the Supplemental materials.   \nParticipant characteristics. \n  Table 1   \n\n\n### Materials \n  \nThe stimuli included 55 scenes and 95 environmental sounds (e.g., woman sneezing, lawn mower starting). We chose these stimuli because scene memories are typical of autobiographical memories and sounds are common cues for such memories ( ). We obtained the images from the International Affective Picture System ( ) and used normative IAPS valence ratings. We considered ratings from 1.0\u20133.5 to be negative, 3.6\u20135.5 to be neutral, and 5.6\u20139.0 to be positive. We only included negative and neutral scenes and did not choose images to be related to a specific trauma. The negative pictures depicted poverty, death/illness, violence, gore, filth, an accident, and hate groups. The neutral pictures depicted animals sometimes looked threatening, daily life activities, objects, and locations, military people and equipment, modes of transportation, locations, and portraits of people. While we did not intentionally choose scenes to be relevant to any individual participant's index trauma, some images may have been relevant to particular traumas. We did not obtain trauma-relevance ratings from the participants; however, a rater judged the trauma-relevance of each image for each trauma and found no more than nine images to be relevant to any participant's index trauma. \n\n\n### Experimental design and procedure \n  \nThe experimental design and procedure is nearly identical to that described in a previous publication in healthy subjects ( ). Here we report a short summary of the experimental design and procedures modified for the goals of the current study. For a full description, see the Supplemental materials and  .   \nBehavioral paradigm. (A) In session 1, during prescan encoding, participants heard a sound paired with a picture and were asked to type a sentence linking the sound and picture. (B) During another prescan encoding session, participants heard unpaired sounds and rated the uniqueness of the sound. (C) In session 2, participants performed a re-encoding session in the scanner, whereupon they were presented with previous stimuli and asked to rate on a 7-point scale how emotional the stimuli were. Participants were instructed that \u2018stimuli\u2019 referred to either the sound-picture pair for paired sounds or sounds alone for unpaired sounds. (D) Participants subsequently heard both paired and unpaired sounds and were asked to judge where the sound was located (left or right). (E) After the scan, all participants heard all sounds and were asked questions about their experiences in the scanner (see text for post-scan questions details). \n  Fig. 1   \n\nTwo days before MRI scanning, participants encoded the 55 paired and 40 unpaired sounds. To ensure strong memory associations, there were four encoding runs, during which participants were presented with the sound-picture pairs and wrote a sentence or a short story linking the sound and the picture. Two days after encoding, they participated in an fMRI session during which they re-encoded the paired and unpaired sounds and then completed the critical sound localization/memory recall runs. During the re-encoding runs, each sound-picture pair and unpaired sound was presented. Participants rated on a 7-point scale how emotional the stimuli were. During the recall runs, the 55 paired and 40 unpaired sounds (randomly intermixed) were presented, panned 15\u00b0 to either the left or the right using specialized audio software (Audacity,  ). Participants indicated the side on which the sound was louder. We presented each sound for 4\u202fs, followed by a 1.5-second response period, during which the screen was blank and participants completed the sound localization judgment. A fixation period followed (jittered with a mean of 4\u202fs, range: 1.5\u202fs\u201310.4\u202fs). At the beginning of the run, we instructed participants to wait until after the sound had ended to respond. Immediately following the scanning session, participants completed a post-scan questionnaire to assess their memory for the scenes. Participants heard all 95 sounds. After the presentation of each sound, participants reported: (1) whether they had remembered a picture when the sound was played during the sound localization task (yes/no), (2) how hard they tried to perform the sound localization task correctly (1\u202f=\u202fdid not try at all, 7\u202f=\u202ftried very hard), (3) how hard they tried to recall a picture during the scan (1\u202f=\u202fdid not try at all, 7\u202f=\u202ftried very hard), and (4) how vivid the memory of the picture was during the scan (1\u202f=\u202fnot at all vivid, 7\u202f=\u202fvery vivid). Lastly, we presented the 55 paired sounds a final time and participants provided a description of the picture originally paired with the sound. Two independent judges rated these descriptions for accuracy. In the case of disagreement, a third judge broke the tie. As described below, only paired sounds that elicited a memory without effort and unpaired sounds that did not elicit a memory and had no retrieval effort were analyzed. \n\n\n### Image acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nImaging was conducted on a 3\u202fT GE Signa Excite MRI scanner (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) with an eight-channel head coil. Following a localizer scan was a T1-weighted structural image, (96 contiguous slices acquired with a high-resolution, 3D fast inverse recovery-prepared spoiled gradient recalled (SPGR) sequence, with a repetition time (TR)\u202f=\u202f3.22\u202fms, echo time (TE)\u202f=\u202f8.2\u202fms, inversion recovery time (TI)\u202f=\u202f450\u202fms, 1\u202fmm slice thickness, and parallel imaging with a selection factor of 2). During the task, T2*- weighted echo-planar, functional images were acquired using a spiral-in sequence with SENSE imaging (34 contiguous slices, TR\u202f=\u202f2000\u202fms, TE\u202f=\u202f30\u202fms, FOV\u202f=\u202f240\u202fmm, 3.8\u202fmm slice thickness with no gaps, flip angle\u202f=\u202f70\u00b0, voxel size\u202f=\u202f3.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.8\u202fmm, 64\u202f\u00d7\u202f64 matrix, SENSE factor\u202f=\u202f2). Preprocessing and analyses of functional imaging data were conducted with Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK), along with locally developed Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) scripts. We discarded the first three volumes of each run, including the first trial of each run, for scanner stability. We also excluded the discarded trials for each run from behavioral analyses. Images were corrected for slice-timing and head motion, spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute template using a 12-parameter affine model, and then spatially smoothed with an 8-mm Gaussian kernel. A high-pass filter was included in every model to correct for scanner drift. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nWe created two general linear models: a Memory model comparing paired and unpaired sound trials and an Emotion model comparing high and low emotional valence trials. In the Memory model, the first-level model included regressors for paired sound trials in which there was a reported memory and a low effort rating (1 or 2 out of 7), and unpaired sound trials for which there was no reported memory and a low effort rating. We split these trials according to sound lateralization (paired left, paired right, unpaired left, and unpaired right) to account for this additional variance. We collapsed the sound lateralization factor at the second level. In both models, we included all high-effort trials, paired sound trials that did not elicit a memory, and unpaired sound trials that did elicit a memory as trials of no interest, as well as regressors accounting for motion and run-level effects. \n\nIn the Emotion model, at the first level, we separately included regressors for high and low emotion paired sounds (both with low-effort and that elicited a memory). We only used paired sounds in this model because unpaired sounds did not have a paired picture from which IAPS ratings could be used to classify it as high or low emotion. Therefore, we included unpaired sounds as trials of no interest. \n\nWe initially identified activations using a finite impulse response (FIR) model ( ;  ), which we preferred over a standard canonical hemodynamic response model to better understand the temporal dynamics of involuntary memory retrieval. We initially modeled seven TRs, or 14\u202fs, starting at the beginning of the trial, not adjusted for the hemodynamic lag, but included only the 3rd to 6th TRs in analyses. The 1st and 2nd TRs were not analyzed to account for the hemodynamic lag ( ) as activity occurring before this could not reliably be attributed to the presentation of the sound at the beginning of each trial. The 7th TR was not analyzed because it corresponded to the beginning of the subsequent trial. The 3rd and 4th TRs corresponded to the time period during which peak activity associated with the sound would be expected to occur, accounting for hemodynamic lag. The 5th and the 6th TRs corresponded to the time period during which involuntary memories could continue to be formed. \n\nAdditionally, exploratory analyses revealed that activity was similar in the 3rd and 4th TRs and in the 5th and the 6th TRs. Therefore, to maintain a consistent length of time represented by each time point we collapsed these pairs of TRs to create an   early and a late time point  . The late time point included the 1.5\u202fs response period and 2.5\u202fs of the jitter. The late time point was not contaminated by the cognitive processes involved in the subsequent trial because the hemodynamic response for the subsequent trial does not peak until approximately 6\u202fs after that trial begins. We report whole-brain results at a significance threshold of   p  \u202f<\u202f0.05 using a false discovery rate (FDR) correction and a cluster correction of   p  \u202f<\u202f0.05, using a family-wise error (FWE) correction. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \n#### Memory model: paired\u202f>\u202funpaired \n  \nWe report behavioral results for paired\u202f>\u202funpaired sounds in  . PTSD participants reported more involuntary memories (those retrieved with low effort) than controls, and paired sounds elicited more involuntary memories than unpaired sounds. Additionally, focusing only on trials included in the fMRI analyses (paired sounds that elicited a memory and unpaired sounds that did not), an ANOVA revealed higher emotion ratings (gathered during encoding) and vividness (gathered during the post-scan retrieval run) for paired sounds relative to unpaired sounds (see  ).   \nMemory model behavioral results. Note, the number of trials modeled, shown in parantheses in the % recalled column, were not included in tests of behavioral differences. \n  Table 2       \n\n\n#### Emotion model: high\u202f>\u202flow emotion \n  \nWe report behavioral analyses for high\u202f>\u202flow emotion sound-picture pairs in  . Notably, the PTSD group had more involuntary memories to both high and low emotion trials than controls. There was no effect of emotion on the number of memories recalled.   \nEmotion model behavioral results. Note, the number of trials modeled, shown in parantheses in the % Recalled column, were not included in tests of behavioral differences. \n  Table 3       \n\nThere were no reaction time differences for either model. Behavioral performance on the localization task for both models is reported in the Supplemental materials. \n\n\n#### Post-scan recall \n  \nWe quantified the number of pictures that were accurately recalled voluntarily after the scan. Technical error resulted in missing data for one PTSD participant. There was an effect of Group (F(1, 82)\u202f=\u202f5.80,   p  \u202f<\u202f0.05), with the PTSD group accurately recalling a greater percentage of the pictures (PTSD mean: 0.92, control mean: 0.85), an effect of Emotion (F(1, 82)\u202f=\u202f4.03,   p  \u202f<\u202f0.05), with a greater percentage of low emotion pictures being accurately recalled (low emotion mean: 0.92, high emotion mean: 0.86), but no Group x Emotion interaction (F(1, 82)\u202f=\u202f0.06,   p\u202f>  \u202f0.05). \n\n\n\n### Neuroimaging results \n  \nBecause we could not be certain when the involuntary memories would occur, we probed neural activity at two time points: an early time point including the 4\u202fs when the sound played, and a late time point including the 4\u202fs after the sound stopped. We first discuss the results of a Memory model in which the neural underpinnings of involuntary memories can be probed in both groups. The Memory model is a 2 (Group)\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 (Time) model. Then we discuss an Emotion model in which we contrast high and low emotion trials. Since all results shown are for the negative\u202f>\u202fneutral trials, this model is also a 2 (Group)\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 (Time) design. \n\n#### Memory model: paired sounds\u202f>\u202funpaired sounds \n  \n##### Group\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime interaction \n  \nResults from the Group\u202f\u00d7\u202fTime interaction revealed timing differences in a similar set of regions for controls (early\u202f>\u202flate) and PTSD (late\u202f>\u202fearly): bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, IPC, and PCC exhibited delayed activity in the PTSD group compared to the control group ( ,  ). There was no activity for the reverse contrast (control late\u202f>\u202fearly, PTSD early\u202f>\u202flate).   \nMemory model. Group (PTSD, Control)\u202f\u00d7\u202fTime (Early, Late) interaction.

These graphs indicate that the paired\u202f>\u202funpaired sound difference is greater for the control group than the PTSD group during the early time point but that this difference is greater for the PTSD group than the control group in the late time point. C. Time courses for paired and unpaired sounds are plotted separately. The data are available on neurovault:  . \n  Fig. 2     \nMemory model.

Note: peaks from the ROIs were not among the top peaks in this table but are shown in  . \n  Table 4   \n\n###### Group\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime interaction follow-up analyses \n  \nTo further explore the change in neural activity between the early and the late time points in the control and PTSD groups, we test the observation that our results may be due to a difference between groups at one time window but not the other. We first calculated the average BOLD signal estimates for each time point for each of the six regions shown in  . We then subtracted the early and late BOLD signal estimates to determine the change in activity between the early minus the late time points in the control group and the late minus the early time points in the PTSD group. Finally, we calculated the ratio of the change in activity between time points. The closer the ratio is to one, the more similar the change in activity between time points. The average ratio across all six regions is 0.659, suggesting that the change in activity between the early and late time points was similar across groups. See Table S1 for more details. \n\nAdditionally, we examined the paired\u202f>\u202funpaired sound contrast (i.e. sounds that elicited a memory\u202f>\u202fsounds that did not elicit a memory) during the early time point for the control group combined with the late time point for the PTSD group. This analysis revealed whether activity at the early time point for the control group and the late time point for the PTSD group was greater than zero. There was significant activity in posterior midline regions and inferior parietal cortex. When the threshold was raised slightly to   p  \u202f<\u202f0.055, FDR corrected for multiple comparisons, our a priori hypothesized region, the parahippocampal gyrus, was also active (see Fig. S1 and Table S2). There was no activity for the control group late combined with the PTSD group early. This supports our claim that involuntary memories elicit activity in a similar network of regions at different times for the two groups. \n\n\n\n##### Main effect of group \n  \nThere was no significant main effect of group, suggesting that the regions associated with memory retrieval are similar between groups. To test for similarities within the memory network between groups, we conducted two additional analyses. First, we extracted estimates of activity in these regions for both groups in both time points and ran   t-  tests to compare the groups. We compared control early to PTSD late and compared PTSD early to control late since the Group x Time analysis suggested that the memory network was similar between groups but peaked at different times. There were no differences in activity between the early time point in the control group and the late time point in the PTSD group in any region and the absolute value of the   t-scores   was lower than one for five out of the six regions of interest. Turning to differences between the late time point in the control group and the early time point in the PTSD group, there were no differences in activity and   t-scores   were lower than 1.2 for the all regions (see  ). This suggests that memory network activity is similar between groups but with different peak times.   \nA between-group, between-time point comparison of activity associated with involuntary memory retrieval. The regions are shown in  . There is similar activity between the early time point in the control group and the late time point in the PTSD group in all regions. There is also similar activity between the late time point in the control group and the early time point in the PTSD group in all regions. This suggests that a similar neural network underlies involuntary memory retrieval in PTSD and controls with the difference being the time that it peaks. \n  Table 5     \n\nSecond, we lowered the threshold for the test of the Main Effects of Group to determine whether there were differences between groups at a slightly more lenient threshold. There was no activity for control > PTSD at a threshold as high as   p  \u202f<\u202f0.45, FDR corrected for multiple comparisons. Even raising the threshold as high as   p  \u202f<\u202f0.65 only revealed a 16-voxel cluster in the postcentral gyrus. There was no activity for PTSD > control at a threshold as high as   p  \u202f<\u202f0.95. The lack of activity in regions thought to be involved in memory retrieval even at these extremely lenient thresholds supports our claim that activity in these regions is similar between groups but with peaks at different times. \n\n\n##### Main effect of time \n  \nThere was no significant main effect of time. \n\n\n\n#### Emotion model: high versus low emotion \n  \nHaving established that high and low emotion involuntary memories elicit activity in regions that we predicted, but at different times for the control and PTSD groups, we turn to examining the differences between high and low emotion involuntary memories. \n\n##### Comparing high\u202f>\u202flow emotion involuntary memories across group and time: group\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime interaction \n  \nThere was no significant Group\u202f\u00d7\u202fTime interaction. \n\n\n##### Comparing high\u202f>\u202flow emotion involuntary memories across group and time: main effect of group \n  \nAcross both time points, the PTSD group exhibited greater activity in vmPFC and ACC.

First, a similar network of regions is active during involuntary memory retrieval for PTSD and controls. Second, compared to controls, individuals with PTSD showed delayed neural responsivity in regions typically associated with memory retrieval ( ;  ) and previously shown to be associated with involuntary memory retrieval in healthy adults ( ). Third, compared to controls, individuals with PTSD showed increased vmPFC/ACC activity for high > low emotion stimuli. \n\n### Finding 1: similarities in the memory network between PTSD and controls \n  \nInvoluntary memories elicited similar activity between controls and PTSD in regions involved in the memory network, including the MTL, precuneus, PCC, and IPC. This is in contrast with neurobiological models of PTSD based on voluntary memory retrieval that emphasize dysfunctional activity in the medial temporal lobes and related memory circuits ( ;  ;  ;  ). Also, in contrast with the voluntary memory literature, we show that the PTSD group had more involuntary memories than the control group. This is consistent with work showing a positive correlation between the frequency of involuntary memories and PTSD symptoms ( ) whereas voluntary memory retrieval, as measured by neuropsychological testing, is impaired in PTSD ( ) and may even be a risk factor for PTSD ( ). One reason for these deficits could be that individuals with PTSD have decreased executive control functioning ( ;  ; for reviews, see  ;  ). Since involuntary memory retrieval requires little, if any, executive control, unlike voluntary memory retrieval, these results suggest that memory network integrity and behavioral performance may partially depend on whether retrieval requires cognitive control. \n\n\n### Finding 2: delayed activity in the memory network in PTSD \n  \nAnalyses indicated a lag in activity in the memory network in PTSD compared with controls. This timing effect is extremely strong, with over 70,000\u202fvoxels in 15 peaks showing earlier activity in the control group compared to no significant activity peaking earlier in the PTSD group. This effect has negligible odds of occurring by chance. Moreover, the activity includes locations we predicted would be active during involuntary memory retrieval based on the existing literature. These findings align with both behavioral work showing delayed response times in PTSD during voluntary memory retrieval ( ) and neuroimaging work showing slow neural responsivity in PTSD in similar regions during voluntary memory retrieval ( ). Our results indicate that this processing delay is not limited to effortful retrieval. \n\nThe time of peak activity in the control group is consistent with other work showing that neural activity in response to involuntary recall in healthy individuals peaks up to 6\u202fs after the memory ( ). However, other work comparing the retrieval of memories that had previously been recalled as flashbacks in PTSD showed that compared with control participants, PTSD showed decreased posterior midline and parahippocampal activity ( ). Though at first glance this appears to be inconsistent with our results, it highlights the necessity of investigating the difference in the timing of the neural response to such memories. In the current study, when activity was compared between groups in the early time point, there appeared to be hypoactivity in the controls and hyperactivity in the PTSD group in similar regions. It was not until later activity was examined that activity in these regions was revealed in the PTSD group. This suggests that hypoactivity found in   and other studies ( ;  ;  ;  ) could be reexamined in light of these results. \n\nWe offer four possible explanations for this delayed activity in the memory network in PTSD. The first explanation is that involuntary memories take longer to construct in PTSD. The involuntary memories measured here were more vivid in PTSD than controls. This finding is consistent with other work showing highly vivid intrusive memories in PTSD ( ;  ) that decrease in vividness after therapy ( ). Memories become more specific and likely more vivid as more time passes to construct the memory ( ;  ). It is possible that more time is needed to construct highly vivid memories in PTSD. A second possible explanation is that the slowed processing speed is driven by factors that affect both effortful and non-effortful cognitive processes. Not only do PTSD patients have slowed reaction times to tasks that require cognitive control ( ;  ; for a review, see  ) but they have slower reaction times during reflexive attention tasks ( ;  ), which may reflect a generalized cognitive slowing. This could be caused by increased fatigue or decreased cognitive capacity. PTSD participants in our study did not have slowed reaction times to the localization task. This is likely because participants were given 4\u202fs to respond and speeded responding was not emphasized in the instructions. Other work has shown that when speed is not emphasized, reaction time is not slowed in PTSD (e.g.  ;  ). Third, this processing delay is the result of increased cognitive demand caused by coping with internal psychological distress or monitoring the environment for threats ( ). Fourth is that people with PTSD try to avoid having memories. Using the think/no-think paradigm ( ) activity during memory retrieval can be modulated by instructing participants to not think of a memory ( ;  ). One of the required symptoms of PTSD is avoidance ( ), which involves trying to avoid having emotional memories or to suppress the emotional response. People with PTSD avoid thinking about their trauma ( ;  ) and avoid emotionally processing memories ( ). In contrast, people without PTSD are less likely to suppress or distract themselves after an involuntary memory ( ). However, suppression is generally unsuccessful in PTSD ( ), so it is possible that the attempt at suppression only delays the onset of the memory. Future work controlling for these factors and investigating different types of involuntary memories, like trauma-specific memories, will shed light on this issue. \n\n\n### Finding 3: hyperactivity in vmPFC/ACC \n  \nThere was also increased vmPFC/ACC activity in PTSD compared to controls for high versus low emotion involuntary memories. Fear regulation models have posited that the vmPFC/ACC modulates fear extinction and emotion regulation by downregulating activity in the amygdala ( ;  ); the vmPFC/ACC may be involved in regulating other emotions as well ( ;  ). In PTSD, the vmPFC/ACC is typically hypoactive, putatively leading to a hyperresponsive amygdala ( ). This has also been shown in voluntary recall of traumatic events and emotional scenes ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ) but it is not clear whether this hypoactivity could be expected to generalize to involuntary memories. While there is no previous work on the neural basis of involuntary memories in PTSD to inform this question, involuntary memories do share traits with studied phenomena, like responses to unexpected stimuli. Models discussing this vmPFC/ACC hypoactivity are based on task paradigms in which the emotional items are the focal point ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ,  ,  ;  ), and are thus expected. However, investigating responses to unexpected stimuli is critical because many key symptoms revolve around such responses ( ). In fact, unexpected stimuli appear to elicit different neural responses than do expected stimuli. For example, stimuli presented quickly, below the threshold of conscious detection, elicit heightened vmPFC/ACC activity in PTSD compared to controls ( ,  ,  ), as do emotional stimuli presented as distractors ( ;  ;  ;  , but see  ). Our results suggest that the unexpected nature of involuntary memories may elicit hyperactivity not predicted by prevailing PTSD models. Hyperactivity in these contexts may reflect the generation of nonconscious fear signals that reorient attention to threatening stimuli ( ;  ). \n\nConsistent with the idea that vmPFC/ACC hypoactivity is not a canonical PTSD correlate, as implied by prevailing PTSD models, is a lesion study showing that vmPFC lesions decrease the likelihood of developing PTSD ( ). If vmPFC/ACC hypoactivity results in increased amygdala activity, then a lesion here should cause increased emotional responsivity and increased PTSD symptomology. The role of the vmPFC is multifaceted. It has been shown to be involved in self-referential thought ( ;  ), and the retrieval of contextual details and initiating subsequent action based on those details ( ;  ). Understanding the circumstances under which there is hypo- versus hyperactivity here and integrating what is known about the role of this region in other cognitive processes is vital to understanding emotion dysfunction in PTSD. \n\nIt can also be noted that the control group had greater activity in the vmPFC/ACC for the neutral stimuli than the negative. It is possible that this relates to attention reorienting ( ) or safety signaling ( ) in controls but not PTSD, but these speculative ideas warrant direct investigation in future work. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThis study has several limitations. First, we used the post-scan self-report of memory retrieval and effort to classify trials as successful, low effort memory trials or not. We classified trials as successful based on participants' self-report of memory retrieval and effort. Though the use of self-report to classify trials may lead to the misclassification of some trials, there is both behavioral and neural evidence that this paradigm does elicit involuntary memories with high frequency. When unique cues are used to cue memories of unique scenes, similar to the cues and scenes used in this paradigm, and participants report the retrieval of involuntary memories as they occur in real time, almost 60% of the cues elicit involuntary memories ( ). This rate is similar to the frequency with which involuntary memories are elicited in our control group, shown above. Additionally, involuntary memories occur more frequently in PTSD than in controls ( ), similar to the pattern that we find. Finally, the similarity in neural activity for voluntary and involuntary memory retrieval ( ) suggests that the use of post-hoc self-report to classify trials is reasonably accurate. \n\nSecond, our claim that there is similar activity between groups in regions critical for memory retrieval, but at different times, is derived from the Group x Time interaction effect in the Memory Model, and the lack of a Main Effect of Group. To ensure that the similar activity did not rely solely on a null result, we conducted four additional analyses to make four additional claims. In the first analysis, we focused on the six key regions of interest for memory retrieval. We conducted   t-tests   comparing activity between the early time point in the control group and the late time point in the PTSD group, as well as between the late time point in the control group and the early time point in the PTSD group. The t-scores were all smaller than 1.5 and for 9 of the 12 they were smaller than one. In the second analysis, we showed that there was no Main Effect of Group even at extremely lenient thresholds. In the third analysis, we showed that there was significant activity in these critical memory regions for the control group early and the PTSD group late, and that there was no activity for the control group late and the PTSD group early. This shows that activity in these regions was not driven solely by the difference between the early and late time points, but that the activity in both groups is significantly greater than zero. In the fourth analysis, we compared the change in activity between the early and late time points in the six regions of interest between groups and showed that it was similar between groups for most regions. Together, this set of supplemental analyses lend significant support to our claim that the activity in this involuntary memory network is similar between groups but that it peaks at different times between groups. \n\nThird, encoding processes are sometimes disrupted in PTSD ( ), suggesting that the neural differences we find may be due to differences in encoding. However, impaired encoding should result in impaired voluntary retrieval. The voluntary post-scan recall scores were similar between groups, suggesting that in our paradigm, encoding was preserved in PTSD. This could be due to having several encoding sessions. \n\nFourth, we did not directly measure the relatedness of the stimuli to our participants' trauma. However, using trauma descriptions, we determined the relatedness of each picture to each individual's trauma and found that very few pictures were trauma-relevant for anyone. Therefore, we do not think this issue will have a large impact on results. Again, it should be underscored that the aim of the study was to examine the neural underpinning of involuntary memory processing generally in PTSD, and not specifically in relation to personally traumatic material as this overgeneralization to less traumatic situations is what produces many of the symptoms and dysfunctions of the disorder. However, since the present study was not designed to examine neural activity underlying trauma-related involuntary memories in PTSD, it is therefore not clear whether the findings of delayed activity in the memory network in PTSD will generalize to involuntary, intrusive memories of real-life traumatic events. This is an important question for future research to address. \n\nFifth, we used a relatively high-functioning population; all participants were students or were in the work force. It is possible that people with more debilitating PTSD symptoms could have different neural responses to involuntary memories. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nUnderstanding the neural mechanisms underlying emotional involuntary memories can pave the way toward the development of a treatment that could alleviate this key symptom of PTSD and can also add to the understanding of the basic emotional processing deficits seen in PTSD. The importance of involuntary memories to PTSD is widely recognized with work seeking to understand the mechanisms underlying the encoding of such memories ( ,  ). However, the current study fills a gap in understanding the mechanisms underlying their retrieval. We show that existing models of PTSD do not predict spatiotemporal neural patterning of involuntary memories particularly well. Given that many of the symptoms of PTSD revolve around responses to the unexpected (involuntary memories, startle responses, hypervigilance toward unknown threats), our innovative approach opens up additional lines of inquiry that could be key to understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying these symptoms. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: t0005\n### Label: Table 1\nDemographics\tPTSD mean (SD)\tControl mean (SD)\tp\nAge\t21.48 ( 3.34)\t22.10 ( 4.75)\t0.640\nCAPS\t54.29 (15.88)\t11.29 (10.78)\t<0.001\nBDI\t13.55 ( 9.10)\t3.33 ( 3.69)\t<0.001\nCES\t25.60 ( 5.23)\t15.00 ( 8.77)\t<0.001\nPCL-S\t32.48 (12.42)\t8.67 ( 6.17)\t<0.001\nTLEQ\t6.14 ( 3.53)\t5.19 ( 4.48)\t0.474\n\t\t\t\n### Caption\nParticipant characteristics.\n### Footer\nNone\n\n\n## ID: t0010\n### Label: Table 2\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\t% recalled\t% recalled\tEmotion\tEmotion\tVividness\tVividness\tReaction time\tReaction time\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tAvg.\tSD\tAvg.\tSD\tAvg.\tSD\tAvg.\tSD\nPaired sounds\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nControl\t56.19% (30.00 trials modeled)\t24.24% (12.89)\t4.09\t1.20\t4.55\t1.4\t689.22\t231.53\nPTSD\t68.84% (36.95 trials modeled)\t22.52% (12.11)\t4.24\t0.68\t5.32\t1.3\t713.16\t138.59\nUnpaired sounds\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nControl\t4.08% (36.43 trials modeled)\t5.18% (4.34)\t2.51\t1.18\t1.10\t0.40\t751.06\t223.20\nPTSD\t6.66% (31.67 trials modeled)\t5.41% (9.60)\t2.47\t0.77\t1.06\t0.22\t765.60\t157.02\nANOVA\tF\tp\tF\tp\tF\tp\tF\tp\nMain effect of group\t4.23\t<0.05???\t0.05\t>0.05\t2.79\t>0.05\t0.32\t>0.05\nMain effect of pairing\t238.29\t<0.001???\t60.23\t<0.001???\t309.54\t<0.001???\t0.68\t>0.05\nInteraction\t1.85\t>0.05\t0.20\t>0.05\t3.41\t>0.05\t0.25\t>0.05\n### Caption\nMemory model behavioral results.

This type of headache is characterized by an acute onset and unremitting headache lasting >3\u2009months according to the diagnostic criteria of   International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition   (ICHD\u20103).  The pain associated with NDPH lacks distinct characteristics and can manifest as migraine\u2010like, tension\u2010type\u2010like, or exhibit a combination of both features.  This disease is considered highly disabling due to its persistent headache and therapeutic refractoriness. Furthermore, it is often comorbid with sleep disturbances, psychiatric disorders, light\u2010headedness, concentration problems, sensory disturbances such as numbness or tingling, vertigo, lethargy, and other non\u2010specific syndromes. ,   Some epidemiological evidence showed that mood disorders were more prevalent in patients with NDPH, and 65.5% of the patients had severe anxiety and 40% had severe depression.  To date, there is no defined pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms of NDPH. Some studies have suggested that NDPH might be associated with viral infection, inflammatory cascade, and the release of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, cervical spine joint hypermobility, etc ,   On balance, it seems that most proposed pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms were somewhat speculative. Thus, NDPH remains enigmatic, and further high\u2010quality studies are needed for exploring its mechanism. \n\nNeuroimaging studies have provided evidence for exploring the real\u2010world brain changes in patients with NDPH. Some evidence suggested that there were abnormalities in brain function and structure in adolescents with NDPH.  Our previous studies showed that adult patients with NDPH have unique alterations in hemodynamics, regional homogeneity, multiple frequency amplitudes of low\u2010frequency fluctuation, cortical activity, and brain functional connectivity (FC) in certain brain regions. ,  ,  ,   FC is defined as the temporal coincidence of spatially distant neurophysiological events. Over the last decade, an increasing number of studies have applied magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore FC in headache disorders.  With the development of human brain imaging techniques, numerous studies have focused on examining alterations in higher\u2010order brain regions to understand the central representation of headache and pain. In contrast, fewer investigations have explored the function of brainstem nuclei, primarily due to considerable technical challenges. However, advancements in image analysis techniques, particularly software enabling enhanced spatial normalization of brainstem structures, have significantly improved the accuracy and feasibility of brainstem imaging. The brainstem nucleus plays an important role in central pain pathways related to primary headaches, and some evidence showed that primary headaches were specifically associated with the brainstem nuclei through many neuroimaging studies, which highlight selective brainstem activation. \n\nSo far, there were no studies have focused on the FC of brainstem subregions in patients with NDPH. To gain insights into the involvement of specific brainstem nuclei in this rare primary headache disorder, we applied seed\u2010based resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs\u2010fMRI) analysis to explore FC patterns between region of interest (ROI) to whole brain voxels in patients with NDPH and to explore the correlation between these aberrant FC and clinical variables. We hypothesized that abnormal FC patterns exist in different nuclei of the brainstem in patients with NDPH and that these aberrant FC might be significantly correlated with clinical variables. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Study design \n  \nThis study used a cross\u2010sectional, case\u2013control design to evaluate FC in patients with NDPH and healthy controls (HCs) from rs\u2010fMRI data. All participants involved in the registry provided informed consent after receiving comprehensive details about this study. This was a sub\u2010study of the ongoing China HeadAche DIsorders RegiStry Study (CHAIRS,   Identifier: NCT05334927). Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University (number: KY2022\u2010044). This study conforms to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nForty HCs and 31 patients with NDPH were enrolled in the Headache Center, Department of Neurology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University from October 2020 to October 2022. This set of data was derived from previously published data.  Patients with NDPH were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) Participants were included if they met the definition of NDPH as per the ICHD\u20103 criteria.  This was determined by the following criteria: (A) a persistent headache fulfilling criteria B and C; (B) the headache characterized by a distinct and memorable onset, where the pain becoming persistent and unremitting within 24\u2009h; (C) a headache last for >3\u2009months; and (D) without better explanation by another ICHD\u20103 diagnosis; (2) the eligibility of participants for MRI scans (participants without claustrophobic syndrome and metal implant etc.); (3) none of the enrolled patients with NDPH had received prophylactic treatment for a minimum duration of 3\u2009months. Furthermore, the patients diagnosed with NDPH had no prior history of opioid use, hormonal contraceptive use, and excessive utilization of acute therapy; (4) the availability of comprehensive and complete datasets. Patients with NDPH were excluded if they met the following exclusion criteria: (1) before the scan, there were other secondary factors associated with headache; (2) patients in combination with other types of primary headache; (3) pregnancy or lactation, co\u2010morbidities with other neurological, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or endocrine system diseases, etc.; (4) incomplete or poor quality of MRI data. The inclusion criteria for HCs were (1) feasibility of MRI scanning (participants without claustrophobic syndrome and metal implant, etc.); (2) no history of neurological or other major systemic diseases; (3) those who well\u2010matched the age, gender, etc. of patients with NDPH; (4) first\u2010degree relative without headaches. The exclusion criteria for HCs were (1) pregnancy or lactation; (2) incomplete or poor quality of MRI data. \n\n\n### Demographic data and neuropsychological tests \n  \nWe collected demographic data, encompassing gender, age, body mass index (BMI), as well as pertinent clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with NDPH. These characteristics consisted of age at onset, disease duration, pain intensity associated with NDPH, and the related results of neuropsychological tests. We measured the pain intensity of NDPH using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and assessed the headache's impact with the Headache Impact Test\u20106 (HIT\u20106).  Sleep quality and cognitive function were gauged via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), respectively. ,   An overall score above 7 signifies poor sleep quality, while a MoCA score below 26 points to cognitive impairment. ,   Depression and anxiety levels were evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire\u20109 (PHQ\u20109) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder\u20107 (GAD\u20107), respectively, with a score of 10 indicating symptoms for both measures. ,  \n\n\n### Imaging protocols \n  \nWe conducted the MRI using a 3.0 Tesla MR scanner (Signa Premier, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) equipped with a 48\u2010channel head coil at the National Neurological Center of Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Participants were instructed to minimize head and neck movements, stay awake, relaxed, and keep their eyes closed throughout the scan. Earplugs and foam padding were used to decrease scanner noise and limit head movement. We obtained T1\u2010weighted volumetric images using an MP\u2010RAGE sequence, boasting a 1\u2010mm isotropic resolution (sagittal acquisition, field of view (FOV) of 256\u2009mm, acquisition matrix of 256, 192 slices, flip angle of 8\u00b0, preparation time of 880\u2009ms, recovery time of 400\u2009ms, acceleration factor of 2, acquisition time of 4:00). Resting\u2010state functional MRI (rs\u2010fMRI) data were recorded via a multi\u2010band blood\u2010oxygenation\u2010level\u2010dependent (BOLD) sequence, providing a 2.4\u2010mm isotropic resolution (transverse acquisition, FOV of 208\u2009mm, acquisition matrix of 86, 65 slices with a multi\u2010band factor of 6, flip angle of 64\u00b0, echo time/repetition time of 39/1000\u2009ms, no in\u2010plane acceleration or slice gap, and 330 brain volumes). \n\n\n### Data processing and analyses \n  \nAll MRI data were processed in MATLAB 2016b utilizing both Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) and the Data Processing Assistant for rs\u2010fMRI Advanced Edition (DPARSFA) (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA;  ). We adhered to the following data preprocessing steps: Firstly, we eliminated the initial 20 time points from each functional time course to mitigate the effect of unstable magnetization. Next, we conducted slice timing, implemented motion correction for headaches, performed spatial normalization, and executed spatial smoothing with a full width at half maximum of 8\u2009mm. These procedures were executed utilizing SPM12 (FIL, London, UK). We excluded participants who exhibited head movements beyond 3\u2009mm or rotation exceeding 2\u00b0 in any direction. Co\u2010registered anatomical images were then segmented into white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. These images were subsequently normalized to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, with a resampled voxel size of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm . Finally, we employed DPARSFA for linear trend removal and time bandpass filtering (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) to diminish the impact of low\u2010frequency drift and high\u2010frequency noise. \n\nThe FC analysis steps were as follows: Firstly, we identified 76 nuclei in the brainstem atlas as seeds ( ). Secondly, FC computations of these regions were performed using SPM12. We extracted the time course of the seeds and computed FC between the seed's time course and the average time courses of the whole brain in a voxel\u2010wise manner, employing Pearson's correlation analysis. Thirdly, to enhance normality, we converted correlation coefficients to   z  \u2010values using the Fisher   r  \u2010to\u2010  z   transformation. Fourthly, we conducted a two\u2010sample   t  \u2010test at the voxel level with gender and age as covariates within the brain mask. We set a threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 (two\u2010tailed at the voxel level) and used family\u2010wise error (FWE) correction to adjust to   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 at the cluster level. Lastly, we extracted the average FC values from individual significant clusters for Pearson's correlation analysis with demographic data and neuropsychological tests. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nThe sample size was based on the available data and previous literature.  We described normally distributed data as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and non\u2010normally distributed data as median with interquartile range. The chi\u2010square test allowed comparison of gender between patients and HCs. To compare normally distributed data across groups, we used the two\u2010sample t\u2010test, and for non\u2010normally distributed data, we applied the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to calculate correlations between demographic data, neuropsychological test results, and region of interest (ROI)\u2010related FC values. We set statistical significance at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, and all hypothesis tests were two\u2010tailed. All statistical data were analyzed using SPSS software for Windows (version 25.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). We conducted a two\u2010sample t\u2010test at voxel level in SPM12, with gender and age as covariates, to examine FC differences between patients and HCs. For voxel\u2010based correlation analysis, we used a multiple regression model, considering age and gender as covariates or potential factors; we deemed   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 as significant, applying FWE correction (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05 also considered significant). We implemented multiple corrections when conducting correlation analysis between FC, clinical characteristics, and neuropsychological tests (employing Bonferroni correction,   p  \u2009=\u20090.00016 [0.05/312]). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Participant profiles and clinical characteristics \n  \nWe prospectively recruited 31 patients with NDPH and 40 HCs. However, due to incomplete scans and excessive head movements (>3\u2009mm or maximum rotation exceeding 2\u00b0 in any direction), we excluded 2 patients with NDPH and 3 HCs. Consequently, our study comprised 29 patients with NDPH (15 males, 14 females; age [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD] 37.00\u2009\u00b1\u200921.06\u2009years old) and 37 HCs (16 males, 21 females; age [mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD] 34.89\u2009\u00b1\u200910.96\u2009years old). The demographic details and clinical characteristics of the participants are depicted in Table\u00a0 . Importantly, we found no significant differences in demographic information such as age (  p  \u2009=\u20090.627), gender (  p  \u2009=\u20090.497), BMI (  p  \u2009=\u20090.077), and right\u2010handedness (  p  \u2009>\u20090.999) between the patient and HC groups. Four patients did not have HIT\u20106, PHQ\u20109, GAD\u20107, and PSQI scores and 11 patients did not have MoCA scores due to their reluctance to be assessed by the questionnaires during hospitalization and lost to follow\u2010up after discharge; thus, we excluded these patients from scale\u2010associated analysis. Of the patients included, 16 (64.0%) presented severe headache effects (HIT\u20106 score\u2009\u2265\u200956), 11 (44.0%) exhibited symptom of depression (PHQ\u20109 score\u2009\u2265\u200910), 8 (32.0%) had symptom of anxiety (GAD\u20107 score\u2009\u2265\u200910), 16 (64.0%) reported poor quality of sleep (PSQI score\u2009>7), and 7 (38.9%) showed cognitive impairment (MoCA score\u2009<\u200926). All participants' structural MRI scans were devoid of any irregularities. \n  \nParticipants' demographics and clinical characteristics. \n    \n\n### The   FC   of brainstem nuclei between patients and   HCs  \n  \nBased on 76 nuclei in the brainstem atlas, we finally found abnormal FC in 11 seeds including right inferior medullary reticular formation (iMRt), right mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt), bilateral locus coeruleus (LC), bilateral laterodorsal tegmental nucleus\u2010central gray of the rhombencephalon (LDTg_CGPn), median raphe (MnR), left medial parabrachial nucleus (MPB), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and bilateral ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex (VTA_PBP).

(9) The FC between the PAG and bilateral pulvinar medial thalamus (Figure\u00a0 ; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.034; R:   p  \u2009=\u20090.029) were significantly increased in patients compared to HCs. In contrast, the FC between the PAG and bilateral superior temporal gyrus (Figure\u00a0 ; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.003; R:   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), bilateral insula (Figure\u00a0 ; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.002; R:   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), bilateral middle cingulate gyrus (Figure\u00a0  D\u2013E; L:   p  \u2009=\u20090.004; R:   p  \u2009=\u20090.002) were significantly decreased in patients compared to HCs.

No significant correlation was found between the FC and patients' clinical variables, including the disease duration, headache intensity, the score of HIT\u20106, GAD\u20107, PHQ\u20109, PSQI, MoCA after controlling age and gender (Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nHere, we applied a seed\u2010based approach to explore resting\u2010state FC of brainstem and its possible correlation to clinical variables in patients with NDPH. Interestingly, we found that patients had different brain network patterns in multiple subnuclei of brainstem. This provides us with neuroimaging evidence to elucidate the potential mechanism of this rare primary headache. \n\n### The locus coeruleus in headache and pain \n  \nThe LC serves as a prominent origin of noradrenergic projections within the central nervous system. It dispatches extensive and selective projections to various regions, including the neocortex, spinal cord, hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and certain parts of the thalamus, thus supplying a significant source of noradrenaline. ,  ,   Noradrenaline acts as a powerful modulator of pain, exerting intrinsic control of pain. Besides containing noradrenaline, LC neurons also co\u2010express other neuropeptides known to be involved in headache are also expressed in the LC, including pituitary adenylate cyclase\u2010activating peptide, substance P, and neuropeptide Y, etc. ,  ,  ,  ,   Stress and emotional factors are known triggers for both pain and headache, and the LC is a key mediator of the stress response. Stress\u2010induced activation of the LC and subsequent noradrenaline release can modulate pain sensitivity. ,  ,   Current evidence also suggests that the LC has been implicated in the pathophysiology of headache disorders, including migraine and cluster headache. ,   Dysfunctions in LC activity, such as altered firing rates or abnormal release of noradrenaline, may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of headaches. ,   Above all, the locus coeruleus emerges as a critical player in the intricate network of pain and headache modulation. Our results showed that LC has reduced FC to the cerebellum, although there is no direct neural connection between the cerebellum and LC, they can influence each other indirectly through neural networks. For example, the LC regulates the brain's levels of attention and arousal by releasing neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, and these neurotransmitters may also affect cerebellar activity. This also prompted us to focus on the potential pathogenesis of noradrenaline nuclei in patients with NDPH. \n\n\n### The median raphe in headache and pain \n  \nThe median raphe is a primary source of serotonergic projections in the central nervous system, and its activation leads to the release of serotonin (5\u2010HT) throughout the brain.  It has been implicated in the regulation of pain, headache, and emotional states, playing a crucial role in the etiology and treatment of related disorders.  Furthermore, it has been proposed that the serotonin system is involved in the regulation of various behaviors, including aggression, aversive learning, impulsivity, attention, decision\u2010making, and reward.  Additionally, projections originating from the median raphe nucleus regulate dopaminergic activity in the forebrain. These projections are essential for encoding negative experiences and may have a central role in mood disorders associated with depression and anxiety. ,   NDPH is not only characterized by persistent headache symptoms but often accompanied by psychological symptoms such as depression and anxiety. Our results suggest that these abnormal FC in median raphe may be involved in the pathogenesis of NDPH\u2010related pain, depression, and anxiety. \n\n\n### The   PAG   in headache and pain \n  \nThe PAG plays an important role in the endogenous pain and emotional modulatory system that it can regulate incoming nociceptive information and other kinds of signals, including cognitive behaviors, emotional states, and stress reaction. ,  ,   According to anatomy, PAG was divided into 4 functional areas: (1) dorsomedial (dmPAG); (2) dorsolateral (dlPAG); (3) lateral (lPAG); (4) ventrolateral (vlPAG). The dmPAG, lPAG, and vlPAG can project downward to the brainstem, whereas the dlPAG does not. The vlPAG receives projections from the prefrontal cortices, insula, and central nucleus of the amygdala; innervates the parasympathetic nervous system; and is involved in emotions regulation, endogenous descending pain modulatory system, and innate fear. ,  \n\nAs the largest gray matter nucleus in the diencephalon, the thalamus serves as the central hub for integrating and processing nociceptive signals.  This study showed increased FC between the PAG and pulvinar medial thalamus. The PAG receives nociceptive input signals and projects them upward to the thalamus, which processes the information and projects it to the sensory cortex to participate in pain perception.  Some evidence suggests that PAG can project substantial neurons to the paraventricular thalamic nucleus and is involved in processing acute and/or chronic stressors.  Recent studies have also shown that PKC\u2010dependent signaling pathways in the PAG and thalamus are involved in pain processing,  and reciprocal interactions in these regions may be important for pain perception. \n\nNumerous studies have shown that the cingulate gyrus exhibits specific regulatory functions in emotions, actions, and memory.  The spatial and motor\u2010related information from the parietal cortex is projected to the posterior cingulate cortex and outputted from the midcingulate motor area to the premotor area. Additionally, the anterior cingulate cortex is involved in emotional processing and action, while the posterior cingulate cortex is involved in memory by outputting information to the hippocampus.  Our study found a significant decrease in FC between the PAG and the cingulate cortex. We believe that the dysregulation of emotional, behavioral, and memory functions in the cingulate gyrus may be one of the pathological mechanisms of abnormal emotional behavior and memory in patients with NDPH. The posterior insula receives primary interoceptive signals, and it can process low\u2010level sensory features. This information is then relayed to the anterior insula and integrated emotional, cognitive, and motivational signals from cortical and subcortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, etc. Human behavior involves the dynamic integration of emotions, cognition, and motivation, and its dysfunction is the pathological basis of many psychiatric disorders. Substantial studies have shown that dysfunction of the insula is the common pathological basis of many psychiatric diseases.  Additionally, recent studies have shown that the insula is involved in auditory processing.  Some studies have suggested that the superior temporal gyrus is involved in the perception of emotions in response to facial stimuli and auditory processing. ,   Our results illustrated significantly decreased FC between the PAG and insula and superior temporal gyrus. In summary, we believe the dysfunction of the insula and superior temporal gyrus may reveal the cause of the emotional disorder and phonophobia in patients with NDPH. \n\n\n### The reticular formation in headache and pain \n  \nThe reticular formation, comprising a net\u2010like structure of brainstem nuclei and neurons, spans a wide area of the brainstem from the mesencephalon to the medulla oblongata and extends into the superior cervical spinal cord segments. It plays a pivotal role in coordinating a diverse range of reflexive and essential functions. These encompass arousal, consciousness, circadian rhythm regulation, sleep\u2013wake cycles, somatic motor coordination, cardiovascular and respiratory control, pain modulation, as well as habituation. ,   Studies have shown that the reticular formation receives inputs from peripheral nociceptors and ascending pain pathways, enabling it to actively modulate incoming pain signals and activate the body's endogenous opioid system. ,  ,   This modulation can occur through inhibitory or facilitatory actions of the reticular formation on pain transmission, ultimately influencing the overall pain perception. ,   In the context of headaches, the reticular formation's connections with other regions implicated in headache pathophysiology suggest its contribution to headache generation.  Our results showed that iMRt and mRt had decreased FC with cerebellum_9 and superior temporal gyrus, respectively, which indicated that the abnormal function of reticular formation may play a potential role in the pathogenesis of NDPH. \n\n\n### The parabrachial nucleus in headache and pain \n  \nThe parabrachial nucleus, situated in the dorsolateral pons, encompasses the superior cerebellar peduncle as it enters the brainstem from the cerebellum. Anatomically, it comprises the medial parabrachial nucleus, lateral parabrachial nucleus, and subparabrachial nucleus. This nucleus plays a pivotal role in diverse physiological processes, including arousal, thermoregulation, and blood sugar regulation. ,  ,   Additionally, it is involved in pain modulation, including trigeminal pain.  Furthermore, the rostral region of the parabrachial nucleus establishes connections with the rostral ventromedial medulla, facilitating access to the descending pain modulatory system.  It also connects with higher subcortical structures such as the thalamus and hypothalamus for pain processing, as well as the amygdala for integration with the central autonomic network. ,   Our results showed that medial parabrachial nucleus had decreased FC with cerebellum_1 and cerebellum_2. There is substantial evidence that the cerebellum has extensive fibrous projection with parabrachial nucleus, and those projections involve in modulating classical fear conditioning. ,   However, future basic experiments are needed to verify the specific role of these related projections in headache, pain, and fear memories. \n\n\n### The ventral tegmental area in headache and pain \n  \nThe ventral tegmental area (VTA), situated near the midline on the floor of the midbrain, serves as the source of dopaminergic cell bodies for the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and other dopamine pathways. The VTA has been classified into four distinct zones or subareas by neuroscientists, namely the parabrachial pigmented area, paranigralis nucleus area, rostromedial tegmental nucleus, and parafasciculus retroflexus area. The paranigral and parabrachial areas are characterized by a dense population of dopamine neurons, while the parafasciculus and rostromedial regions exhibit a lower density of dopamine neurons. On the other hand, the paranigral and parabrachial area contains large\u2010sized and separately stained tyrosine hydroxylase neurons. The VTA plays a significant role in various processes, encompassing reward cognition, which involves motivational salience, associative learning, and positive emotions.  Tamara demonstrated that reduced motivation induced by pain in rats is linked to decreased excitability and diminished activity of dopamine (DA) neurons in the VTA.  Some evidence showed glutamatergic stimulation of VTA parabrachial pigmented nucleus neurons reduced nociceptive and spontaneous trigeminocervical complex neuronal firing. \n\nThe cingulate cortex, positioned in the medial aspect of the cerebral cortex, constitutes a pivotal component of the limbic system, which is responsible for emotion formation and processing, as well as learning and memory.  Given its crucial role, the cingulate cortex holds significant importance in disorders like depression and schizophrenia.  Neurons from the VTA innervate the cingulate cortex. Our results showed that ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex had decreased FC with cingulate cortex. This may cause emotional and affective abnormalities in patients with NDPH. Additionally, we found decreased FC between the ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex and thalamus. The VTA receives glutamatergic afferents from the thalamus.  These glutamatergic afferents play a critical role in modulating VTA cell firing. Activation of these neurons leads to an increase in firing rates of dopamine neurons within the VTA, inducing burst firing patterns.  The cerebellum, with its extensive projections to the brainstem, is implicated in pain processing. ,   It receives pain input through descending cortico\u2010cerebellar pathways and ascending spino\u2010cerebellar pathways involving the pontine nuclei and inferior olives. Integration of this information within the cerebellum enables the transfer of relevant signals to the motor system, leading to a conscious motor response to pain that can be modulated according to pain intensity. Our results suggested that ventral tegmental area\u2010parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex had decreased FC with cerebellum. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of cerebellar pain regulation in NDPH patients need to be further studied. \n\nWe found that FC values were significantly reduced in the VTA and substantia nigra of patients with NDPH. The dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area of the midbrain project to different regions: the dorsolateral caudate/putamen and the ventromedial nucleus accumbens, respectively. These projections establish the mesostriatal and mesolimbic pathways. Disruptions in these pathways contribute to various disorders, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  This suggests that patients with NDPH were more likely to have psychiatric comorbidities. \n\n\n### The laterodorsal tegmental nucleus in headache and pain \n  \nThe laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), a significant cluster of cholinergic cells situated in the periventricular mesopontine tegmentum, sends ascending cholinergic projections through relays in the rostral thalamus and basal forebrain. These projections have been traditionally associated with promoting cortical arousal and facilitating the onset of rapid eye movement sleep. ,   Moreover, LDTg are master regulators of the firing pattern of dopamine neurons, with tonic input from LDTg being imperative for glutamate elicited burst\u2010firing activity of VTA neurons. ,   Given these central functions, prior physiological and anatomical investigations of the LDTg have primarily emphasized its connections with the thalamus, basal forebrain, and VTA\u2010nigra complex. Previous studies have shown that voluntary wheel running in mice with neuropathic pain induces exercise\u2010induced hypoalgesia, potentially through the activation of the mesolimbic reward system mediated by LDTg and lateral hypothalamic area neurons.  Positioned at the intersection of descending information from other brain areas and ascending nociceptive information from the spinal cord, the cerebellum is uniquely poised to modulate and be modulated by the processing of pain. However, our results showed decreased FC values between LDTg and cerebellum in patients with NDPH, which may suggest a novel underlying mechanism. \n\nIn conclusion, brain regions such as LC, raphe nucleus, PAG, reticular formation, parabrachial nucleus, VTA, and LDTg play important roles in NDPH. These regions constitute a complex neural circuit of headache, and abnormal FC may contribute to headache onset and exacerbation. For example, regions such as the LC and para\u2010brachial nucleus are involved in pain regulation and transmission, and when their FC is altered, it may lead to an exacerbation of pain perception. The raphe nucleus and reticular formation are involved in the regulation of vascular tone and blood flow. Abnormal activity of raphe nucleus and reticular formation may lead to vasodilation and blood flow changes, which may cause headache. In contrast, PAG, VTA, and LDTg are related to emotion regulation and stress, and their dysfunction may lead to worsening headache. Therefore, changes in FC of these brain regions are closely related to headache, and an in\u2010depth understanding of these neural mechanisms can help to better understand and treat headache symptoms. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThis study has certain limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, it is important to note that this study was conducted at a single center with a relatively small sample size, and thus, our preliminary findings require validation with larger datasets. Secondly, as a cross\u2010sectional study, we were unable to assess the changes in FC over the course of disease progression or determine their reversibility. Longitudinal studies are warranted to examine the correlation between FC and prognosis as well as disease progression. Moreover, the use of the 76 brainstem regions as seeds in this study limited our analysis to the whole regions without considering their subregions. Notably, different subregions of the seeds may possess distinct physiological functions that could influence FC analyses. Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that psychiatric comorbidities, particularly chronic anxiety and depression, even if at a low grade and untreated, might impact FC in NDPH. Further investigations are necessary to assess whether such comorbidities contributed to the observed FC abnormalities. Therefore, future studies should explore the FC within the subregions of these seeds to enhance our understanding of the central pathogenesis of NDPH. Additionally, applying comparative analysis of established FC using cross\u2010correlation synchronization indices and dynamic FC between these different ROIs might yield significant conclusions. Conducting a subgroup analysis to explore differences between NDPH subgroups could uncover valuable insights, potentially differentiating NDPH more clearly from other headache types. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nGiven the persistent pain experienced in NDPH, the lack of identifiable causes, and the absence of evidence\u2010based treatment options, it is crucial to investigate this debilitating yet low\u2010incidence condition. This study aims to explore the FC of various brainstem regions in adults with NDPH. The results indicate abnormal FC in multiple brainstem nuclei implicated in pain and emotions processing and regulation among NDPH patients. Furthermore, these findings contribute to our understanding of central nervous system dysfunction underlying associated symptoms in NDPH and offer potential avenues for physicians to explore in the management of chronic pain. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nWei Wang, Yonggang Wang, and Binbin Sui supported the conception and design of this project.

The fMRI functional voice localizer (comprising a univariate analysis contrasting stimulation with vocal vs. non-vocal sounds) is known to give robust estimates of the temporal voice areas (TVAs). However, there is growing interest in employing multivariate analysis approaches to fMRI data (e.g., multivariate pattern analysis; MVPA). The aim of the current study was to localize voice-related areas in both female and male listeners and to investigate whether brain maps may differ depending on the gender of the listener. After a univariate analysis, a random effects analysis was performed on female (  n   = 149) and male (  n   = 123) listeners and contrasts between them were computed. In addition, MVPA with a whole-brain searchlight approach was implemented and classification maps were entered into a second-level permutation based random effects models using statistical non-parametric mapping (SnPM; Nichols and Holmes,  ). Gender differences were found only in the MVPA. Identified regions were located in the middle part of the middle temporal gyrus (bilateral) and the middle superior temporal gyrus (right hemisphere). Our results suggest differences in classifier performance between genders in response to the voice localizer with higher classification accuracy from local BOLD signal patterns in several temporal-lobe regions in female listeners. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPrior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings suggest a robust brain response to vocal vs. non-vocal sounds in many regions of the human auditory cortex in particular in the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Vocal sounds, including but not restricted to speech sounds, evoke a greater response than non-vocal sounds with bilateral activation foci located near the anterior part of the STG extending to anterior parts of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and posterior foci located in the middle STS (Binder et al.,  ; Belin et al.,  ,  ). Using the functional voice localizer, these findings were replicated and used in various studies (Belin et al.,  ,  ; Kreifelts et al.,  ; Latinus et al.,  ; Ethofer et al.,  ). The conventional way of identifying voice sensitive regions is by applying univariate statistics, implemented using a Generalized-Linear Model (GLM), to fMRI data assuming independence among voxels. \n\nInterest has recently grown in applying multivariate approaches (e.g., Multivariate pattern analysis; MVPA). Instead of modeling individual voxels independently (univariate analysis), MVPA considers the information of distributed pattern in several voxels (e.g., Norman et al.,  ; Mur et al.,  ). Several studies used multivariate approaches to decode information reflected in brain activity patterns related to specific experimental conditions (Cox and Savoy,  ; Haynes and Rees,  ,  ; Kotz et al.,  ). MVPA is usually applied on unsmoothed data preserving high spatial frequency information. Thus, MVPA is argued to be more sensitive in detecting different cognitive states. In contrast, the conventional univariate analysis averages across voxels, thereby removing focally distributed effects (spatial smoothing). The smoothing across voxels may lead to a reduction in the information content (Kriegeskorte et al.,  ; Norman et al.,  ; Haynes et al.,  ). At present, a multivariate approach has never been employed to investigate whether it may yield a different pattern of voice-specific (voice/non-voice classification) brain regions compared to the univariate analysis. \n\nThe voice contains socially and biologically relevant information and plays a crucial role in human interaction. This information is particularly relevant for interaction between different genders (e.g., regarding emotions, identities, and attractiveness) (Belin et al.,  ,  ). Overall, research suggests that women are more sensitive than men in emotion recognition from faces and voices (Hall,  ; Hall et al.,  ; Schirmer and Kotz,  ). Women perform better in judging others' non-verbal behavior (Hall,  ) and seem to process nonverbal emotional information more automatically as compared to men (Schirmer et al.,  ). In addition, women but not men show greater limbic activity when processing emotional facial expressions (Hall et al.,  ). The exact neural mechanisms underlying voice processing in both female and male listeners still remains under debate. For instance, a study by Lattner et al. ( ) found no significant difference between the activation patterns of female and male listeners in response to voice-related information. However, there is evidence from both behavioral and neural activation studies for differences in voice perception between listeners' gender (Shaywitz et al.,  ; Schirmer et al.,  ,  ,  ; Junger et al.,  ; Skuk and Schweinberger,  ). \n\nA recent behavioral study by Skuk and Schweinberger ( ) investigated gender differences in a familiar voice identification task. They found an own-gender bias for males but not for females while females outperformed males overall. These behavioral differences (Skuk and Schweinberger,  ) may also be reflected by differences in neural activity. Previous fMRI studies investigating potential neural correlates suggested a sex difference in the functional organization of the brain for phonological processing (Shaywitz et al.,  ), in emotional prosodic and semantic processing (Schirmer et al.,  ,  ) and in response to gender-specific voice perception (Junger et al.,  ). Further evidence suggests differences between genders in vocal processing shown by an EEG study, where the processing of vocal sounds with more emotional and/or social information was more sensitive in women as compared to men (Schirmer and Kotz,  ; Schirmer et al.,  ). The above-mentioned studies mainly focus on gender differences in emotional speech processing or opposite-sex perception. However, identified brain regions are not consistent: different experimental designs and applied methods vary and make it difficult to compare between these studies (Shaywitz et al.,  ; Schirmer et al.,  ,  ,  ; Junger et al.,  ). \n\nThe current study employs a well-established experimental design of the functional \u201cvoice localizer,\u201d known to give robust estimates of the TVAs across the majority of participants. The voice localizer includes a variety of different vocal sounds, not exclusively female or male voices, but also speech and non-speech of women, men and infants and non-vocal sounds (e.g., environmental sounds). In this study, we were interested in the effect of gender on the results of the voice localizer and we asked an explorative research question of whether brain activation and/or classification accuracy maps in response to vocal (speech and non-speech) and non-vocal sounds differ between female and male listeners without prior assumptions about the strength of voice-specific activity. \n\nThe voice localizer paradigm is often used in the literature (Belin et al.,  ,  ; Kreifelts et al.,  ; Latinus et al.,  ; Ethofer et al.,  ), which makes it easier to compare among studies as well as among participants or groups. Instead of using the conventional univariate method, employing MVPA may offer a more sensitive approach in order to study potential differences between genders by means of above chance vocal/non-vocal classification accuracies in different regions of the brain. Therefore, we investigated our research question by implementing the conventional univariate analysis using GLM and MVPA based on a support-vector machine (SVM) classifier with a spherical searchlight approach. This approach enabled us to explore cortical activity over the whole-brain and to examine whether activation and/or classification maps in response to the voice localizer may significantly differ between genders. Since the effect size between genders is expected to be very small, the current study offers a substantially large sample size with   n   = 149 females and   n   = 123 males. Thus, this study provides a large sample size, a well-established experimental design and the direct comparison of two different fMRI data analysis approaches applied on the exact same data. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nfMRI data of 272 healthy participants, 149 female (age range: 18\u201368 years; mean \u00b1   SD   = 24.5 \u00b1 8.0) and 123 male (age range: 18\u201361 years; mean \u00b1   SD   = 24.4 \u00b1 6.5) with self-reported normal audition were analyzed. This study was conducted at the Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology (INP) in Glasgow and approved by the ethics committee of the University of Glasgow. Volunteers provided written informed consent before participating and were paid afterwards. \n\n\n### Voice localizer paradigm \n  \nSubjects were instructed to close their eyes and passively listen to a large variety of sounds. Stimuli were presented in a simple block design and divided into vocal (20 blocks) and non-vocal (20 blocks) conditions. Vocal blocks contained only sounds of human vocal origin (excluding sounds without vocal fold vibration such as whistling or whispering) and consisted of speech (e.g., words, syllables, connected speech in different languages) or non-speech (e.g., coughs, laughs, sighs and cries). The vocal stimuli consisted of recordings from 7 babies, 12 adults, 23 children, and 5 elderly people. Half of the vocal sounds (speech and non-speech) consisted of vocalizations from adults and elderly people (women and men) with comparable proportions for both genders (~24% female, ~22% male). The other half of the vocal sounds consisted of infant vocalizations (speech and non-speech) which also included baby crying/laughing. Recorded non-vocal sounds included various environmental sounds (e.g., animal vocalizations, musical instruments, nature and industrial sounds). A total number of 40 blocks were presented. Each block lasted for 8 s with an inter-block interval of 2 s. Stimuli (16bit, mono, 22050 Hz sampling rate) were normalized for RMS and are available at   (Belin et al.,  ). \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nScanning was carried out in a 3T MR scanner (Magnetom Trio Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and all data were acquired with the same scanner at the INP in Glasgow. Functional MRI volumes of the whole cortex were acquired using an echo-planar gradient pulse sequence (voxel size = 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm; Time of Repetition (TR) = 2000 ms; Echo Time (TE) = 30 ms; slice thickness = 3 mm; inter-slice gap = 0.3 mm; field of view (FoV) = 210 mm; matrix size = 70 \u00d7 70; excitation angle = 77\u00b0). A total number of 310 volumes (32 slices per volume, interleaved acquisition order) were collected with a total acquisition time of 10.28 min. Anatomical MRI volumes were acquired using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE) (voxel size = 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm;   TR   = 1900 ms;   TE   = 2.52 ms; inversion time (TI) = 900 ms; slice thickness = 1 mm; FoV = 256 mm; matrix size = 256 \u00d7 265; excitation angle = 9\u00b0; 192 axial slices). \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \n#### Pre-processing \n  \nPre-processing was performed using the statistical parametric mapping software SPM8 (Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK.  ). After reorientation of functional and anatomical volumes to the AC/PC line (anterior- and posterior commissure), functional images were motion corrected (standard realignment). Since, subjects may have moved between anatomical and functional data acquisition, the anatomical volumes were co-registered to the mean functional image produced in the realignment above. Anatomical volumes were segmented in order to generate a binary gray matter template at threshold probability level of 0.5 for each individual participant. This template was applied during model specification in both univariate analysis und MVPA. For the univariate processing, realigned functional volumes were normalized to a standard MNI template (Montreal Neurological Institute) and spatially smoothed with a 6 mm full-width at half mean (FWHM) Gaussian Kernel. \n\n\n#### Univariate analysis \n  \nThe design matrix was defined such that each block of the experimental paradigm correlated to one condition, yielding a design matrix with 20 onsets for each condition (vocal and non-vocal). Analysis was based on the conventional general linear model (GLM) and stimuli were convolved with a boxcar hemodynamic response function provided by SPM8. Contrast images of vocal vs. non-vocal conditions were generated for each individual subject and entered into a second-level random effects analysis (RFX). To declare at the group-level whether any difference between the two conditions was significantly larger than zero, a one-sample   t  -test was applied and FWE-corrected (  p   < 0.05) brain maps were calculated. To investigate whether brain activity significantly differs between genders in response to vocal vs. non-vocal sounds, contrasts between females vs. males (male > female, female > male) were computed in a second level RFX analysis (two-sample   t  -test;   p   < 0.05 FWE-corrected). This analysis was restricted to voxels with classification accuracy significantly above theoretical chance (  p   < 0.01 uncorrected) in both females and males (see MVPA below and yellow area in   Figure 2  ). \n\n\n#### Multivariate pattern analysis \n  \nMultivariate pattern classification was performed on unsmoothed and non-normalized data using Matlab (Mathworks Inc., Natick, USA) and in-house utility scripts (INP, Voice Neurocognition Laboratory; Dr. Bashar Awwad Shiekh Hasan and Dr. Bruno L. Giordano), where the default linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier was applied. The classifier was trained and separately tested following a leave-one out cross validation strategy applied on the 40 beta parameter estimates obtained from the univariate analysis (GLM). \n\nA whole-brain searchlight decoding analysis was implemented using a sphere with a radius of 6 mm (average number of voxels in one sphere: 20.6 \u00b1 1.0   SD  ) (Kriegeskorte et al.,  ). A sphere was only considered for analysis if a minimum of 50% of its voxels were within the gray matter. The data of the voxels within a sphere were classified and the classification accuracy was stored at the central voxel, yielding a 3D brain map of classification accuracy (percentage of correct classifications) (Kriegeskorte et al.,  ; Haynes et al.,  ). To identify brain regions in which classification accuracy was significantly above chance by females and males, the theoretical chance level (50%) was subtracted, then normalized (to the MNI template) and smoothed (6 mm FWHM Gaussian Kernel). To make inference on female and male participants, classification brain maps were entered into a second-level permutation based analysis using statistical nonparametric mapping (SnPM; Statistical NonParametric Mapping; available at  ) with 10,000 permutations (see Holmes et al.,  ; Nichols and Holmes,  ). This was computed separately by gender and the resulting voxels were assessed for significance at 5% level and FWE-corrected, as determined by permutation distribution. Similarly, to assess whether classification brain maps significantly differ between genders in response to vocal/non-vocal sounds, this permutation approach was implemented between groups (female > male, male > female) with 10,000 permutations and the resulting voxels were assessed for significance at 5% level and FWE-corrected, as determined by permutation distribution (see Holmes et al.,  ; Nichols and Holmes,  ). \n\nThe between-group analysis was restricted to a mask defined by voxels with classification accuracy significantly above theoretical chance (  p   < 0.01 uncorrected) in both females and males. The resulting mask included 3783 voxels (yellow area in   Figure 2  ). The same mask was applied for both, the univariate analysis and MVPA. \n\nSeparate brain maps of vocal vs. non-vocal contrast in female and male participants as well as brain maps of contrasts between genders for both, univariate analysis and MVPA were generated using the program MRIcoGL (available at  ). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Univariate analysis: vocal vs. non-vocal sounds \n  \nThe univariate analysis comparing activation to vocal and non-vocal sounds showed extended areas of greater response to vocal sounds in the typical regions of the temporal voice areas (TVA), highly similar for male and female subjects (Figure  ). These regions were located bilaterally in the temporal lobes extending from posterior parts of the STS along the STG to anterior parts of the STS and also including several parts of the superior and middle temporal gyrus (STG, MTG). \n  \n Brain maps of female (red,   n   = 149) and male (blue,   n   = 123) participants  .   (A)   Univariate analysis showing bilateral activation along the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and corresponding contrast estimates of vocal vs. non-vocal sounds plotted for peak voxel (one-sample   t  -test, FWE-corrected,   p   < 0.05; cf. circles, note that the two peaks with highest   T  -value and largest cluster size are indicated per group).   (B)   MVPA showing comparable classification accuracy maps along STS, but not IFG and average classification accuracy \u00b1 s.e.m. at peak voxel (calculated in native space) was distinctly above chance level (0.5) for both females and males (maximum intensity projection of   t  -statistic image threshold at FWE-corrected   p   < 0.05, as determined by permutation distribution with 10,000 permutations). \n  \nSeveral hemispheric maxima of vocal vs. non-vocal response were located bilaterally along the STS in both females and males (Figure  , Table  ). Figure   shows parameter estimates of the vocal > non-vocal contrasts at the maxima of the largest cluster sizes with the highest   T  -values of each hemisphere. The brain activation differences between vocal and non-vocal response was consistent across maxima in females (MNI coordinates left:   x   = \u221257,   y   = \u221216,   z   = \u22122, cluster size 3923,   T   = 20.85; right:   x   = 60,   y   = \u221213,   z   = \u22122,   T  -value = 20.64) and in males (MNI coordinates left:   x   = \u221260,   y   = \u221222,   z   = 1, cluster size 796,   T   = 18.19; right:   x   = 60,   y   = \u221210,   z   = \u22122, cluster size 812,   T  -value = 17.46). Female listeners showed one large cluster covering the temporal lobes and subcortical parts of the brain. By contrast male listeners showed two separate voxel clusters in the left and right temporal lobes and no subcortical cluster connecting the two hemispheres (Table  ). Small bilateral clusters were found in inferior prefrontal cortex (inferior frontal gyrus, IFG) in both female and male listeners (  p   < 0.05 FWE-corrected; Figure  ). \n  \n Voice-sensitive peak voxels of female and male RFX analysis (Univariate)  . \n  \nPeak voxel coordinates in standard MNI space and corresponding t-values above for female and male 4.49 (FWE-corrected p < 0.05). \n  \n\n### MVPA analysis: vocal/non-vocal classification \n  \nThe MVPA analysis showed clusters of significantly above-chance voice/non-voice classification accuracy in the TVAs (Figure  , Table  ) (Figure  , Table  ). Hemispheric maxima of classification accuracy were at comparable locations as the peaks of voice > non-voice activation revealed by the univariate method. The classification accuracy within the peak voxel of female listeners (MNI coordinates left:   x   = \u221260,   y   = \u221216,   z   = 1, cluster size 1676,   T  -value = 20.41; right:   x   = 66,   y   = \u221231,   z   = 4, cluster size 1671,   T  -value = 21.45) as well as for male listeners (MNI coordinates left:   x   = \u221260,   y   = \u221222,   z   = 4, cluster size 984,   T  -value = 13.70; right:   x   = 63,   y   = \u221228,   z   = 4, cluster size 1211,   T  -value = 16.07) were distincly above the theoretical chance level of 0.5 (Figure  ). Overall, the maximal classification accuracy was higher in female listeners as compared to male listeners at the peak voxels (Figure  , mean \u00b1 s.e.m.: left peak in females 0.84 \u00b1 0.006, males 0.83 \u00b1 0.009; right peak in females 0.85 \u00b1 0.007, males 0.84 \u00b1 0.009. Left peak in males 0.83 \u00b1 0.009, females 0.85 \u00b1 0.006, right peak in males 0.85 \u00b1 0.009, females 0.87 \u00b1 0.007). Comparing MVPA and univariate analysis in Figures   the MVPA analysis revealed more superficial cortical regions bilateral at the temporal pole, whereas the voxel cluster of the vocal vs. non-vocal difference of the univariate analysis extend more toward the midline of the brain. \n  \n Voice-sensitive peak voxels of female and male group analysis (MVPA)  . \n  \nPeak voxel coordinates in standard MNI space and corresponding t-values above for female 4.38 and male 4.29 (FWE-corrected p < 0.05, as determined by permutation distribution with 10,000 permutations). \n  \n\n### Female vs. male contrasts \n  \nThe contrast of activation maps (univariate analysis) or classification accuracy maps (multivariate approach) from males and females revealed no significant voxels with greater parameter estimates for males > females at the chosen statistical significance threshold (  p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected) for either analysis methods. The reverse contrast (female > male), however, revealed significant voxel clusters showing greater parameter estimates for univariate analysis and higher classification accuracy for MVPA in female participants (Figure  ). \n  \n Contrast between female > male (red)  .   (A)   Univariate analysis showing significant female > male difference (two-sample   t  -test, FWE-corrected,   p   < 0.05) in the left posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the right anterior STG. Contrast estimates at peak voxel showing stronger activation in females (black) as compared to males (gray) in response to vocal vs. non-vocal sounds.   (B)   MVPA showing significant classification accuracy above chance level in the right middle part of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and the right middle STG as well as in the left middle MTG with higher average classification accuracy in females (black) than in males (gray) (maximum intensity projection of   t  -statistic image threshold at FWE-corrected   p   < 0.05, as determined by permutation distribution with 10,000 permutations). The (yellow) cluster shows the mask including voxels with significantly above chance classification accuracy in both females and males (  p   < 0.01 uncorrected). \n  \nWhen analyzed with the univariate approach (Figure  ) the contrast female > male yielded only a few significant voxels: One cluster consisted of four voxels in the left posterior part of STG and only one voxels in the right Insula (Figure  , Table  ). The corresponding contrast estimates for the reported peak voxels (MNI coordinates left:   x   = \u221248,   y   = \u221234,   z   = 16, cluster size 4,   T  -value = 4.02; right:   x   = 48,   y   = 2,   z   = \u22125, cluster size = 1,   T  -value = 4.04) showed a positive response for females in both hemispheres and for the left hemisphere in males. The Cohen's d effect size values (  d   = 0.48 and 0.49) suggested a moderate difference at the peak voxel (Table  ). Overall, females showed a stronger activation in response to vocal vs. non-vocal sounds as compared to males at both maxima (Figure  ). \n  \n Peak voxels of female > male contrast for univariate analysis and MVPA  . \n  \nPeak voxel coordinates in standard MNI space and corresponding t-values above 3.85 (univariate analysis, FWE-corrected p < 0.05) and 3.70 for MVPA (FWE-corrected p < 0.05, as determined by permutation distribution with 10,000 permutations) and Cohen's d for large cluster size. The Cohen's d of the MVPA refers to the mean difference in classification accuracy (contrast estimates of the univariate analysis respectively), divided by the pooled standard deviation for those means. \n  \nThe female > male contrast of classification accuracy maps identified significant voxel clusters in the middle part of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) in both hemispheres, in which classification accuracy was greater for female than male participants (red clusters in Figure  ). Areas of greater classification accuracy in females were more extended in the left hemisphere with an additional smaller cluster located in the STG. The peak voxels of female > male classification accuracy difference were located in the middle part of the MTG (bilateral), and the left middle STG (MNI coordinates left:   x   = \u221269,   y   = \u2212 19,   z   = \u22128, cluster size 84,   T  -value = 5.22;   x   = \u221251,   y   = \u221222,   z   = 13, cluster size 156,   T  -value = 5.19; right:   x   = 69,   y   = \u22127,   z   = \u221211, cluster size 52,   T  -value = 4.48; cf. circle in Figure  ). The Cohen's d effect size values (  d   = 0.35, 0.35, and 0.24) suggested a small difference at the peak voxel (Table  ). Classification accuracy (computed in native space) at these coordinates was distinctly above chance (50%) for both females and males, but higher in females across peaks (Figure  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study aimed to investigate gender differences on voice localizer scans by employing the conventional univariate analysis as well as MVPA. Both analysis approaches revealed largely overlapping/comparable and robust estimates of the TVAs in female and male listeners. However, the MVPA was more sensitive to differences in the middle MTG of the left and right hemispheres and the middle left STG between genders as compared to univariate analysis with higher classification accuracy in women. \n\n\n## Robust TVAs \n  \nThe estimated TVAs using MVPA robustly replicated and confirmed prior fMRI findings applying the voice localizer (Belin et al.,  ,  ; Belin and Zatorre,  ; Scott and Johnsrude,  ; Von Kriegstein et al.,  ). Both analysis methods showed comparable maps of classification accuracy (MVPA) and of vocal vs. non-vocal activity difference (univariate analysis) for both female and male listeners. The average classification accuracy at the peak voxel was distinctly above chance level and higher in female as compared to male listeners. The peak voxels were at comparable locations (along middle and posterior parts of the STS) for both analysis approaches and both genders. A small difference between the MVPA and univariate analysis can be seen bilateral at the temporal pole, where the MVPA detected more vocal/non-vocal differences in superficial cortical regions as compared to the univariate analysis. In addition to the activation brain maps showing the robustly estimated TVAs (univariate analysis), the MVPA results extend previous findings by providing a corresponding classification accuracy brain map. When brain maps are considered for each analysis approach and for female and male listeners separately, our findings showed no distinct differences between genders and between univariate analysis and MVPA. Instead comparable voxel clusters of a similar size in the bilateral temporal lobes were identified, verifying the prior univariate analysis and the robustness of the TVAs (see e.g., Belin et al.,  ). \n\n\n## Gender differences \n  \nWhen data were analyzed with MVPA, differences between female and male listeners in response to vocal/non-vocal sounds were found by contrasting female > male (but not male > female). A significant difference in success of the MVPA between female and male listeners was apparent in the middle part of the MTG in both hemispheres and in the middle part of the STG in the left hemisphere. Effect sizes showed a small difference at the peak voxels. Despite the large sample size used in this study, the univariate analysis showed no major activation differences between genders. Only two small clusters with one to four voxels were significant in the posterior and anterior part of the STG. In the univariate analysis, the overall activation difference between vocal vs. non-vocal sounds was stronger in female as compared to male listeners and effect sizes showed a moderate difference at the peak voxels. \n\nThe distinct gender differences located in the middle part of MTG and middle part of STG between genders revealed by the MVPA survived our applied criteria (FWE-correction). In these regions, the classifier successfully distinguished between the vocal and non-vocal condition with better overall accuracy in females as compared to males across the peak voxels. Thus, BOLD signal in parts of auditory cortex seem to carry less information for discriminating vocal from nonvocal sounds in male than females listeners. We do not make any inference on the nature of the underlying processing differences in terms of mental states or cognitive mechanisms, but possible explanations for our findings are discussed below. \n\nMVPA may overall be more sensitive to detect small differences in the activation patterns to vocal and non-vocal sounds. Thus, differences between genders appear significant only when analyzed with MVPA (Haynes et al.,  ; Kriegeskorte et al.,  ; Norman et al.,  ). The differences in classification accuracy between female and male listeners, identified in parts of auditory cortex, may be contributed to by a different predisposition of female/male listeners to the presented vocal sound samples of the voice localizer. Previous findings suggest a sex-difference in response to infant crying and laughing. Women showed a deactivation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to both laughing and crying (independent of parental status) as compared to men (Seifritz et al.,  ). In contrast, another study showed increased activation to infant vocalization in the amygdala and ACC whereas men showed increased activation to the control stimuli (fragment recombined and edge smoothed stimuli of the original laughing/crying samples). This may reflect a tendency in women for a response preference to infant vocal expressions (Sander et al.,  ). A recent study by De Pisapia et al. ( ) found a sex-difference in response to a baby cry. Women decreased brain activity in DPFC regions and posterior cingulate cortex when they suddenly and passively heard infant cries, whereas men did not. They interpreted their findings in such a way that the female brain interrupts on-going mind-wandering during cries and the male brain continues in self-reflection (De Pisapia et al.,  ). In our study half of the vocal stimuli consisted of infant vocalizations (also emotional expressions such as laughing and crying) and our results may reflect differences in the fine-grained pattern of distributed activity in female and male listeners in response to these vocal expressions of children and babies. The outcome in this study may be affected by anatomical differences in brain structure/size between female and male listeners (Brett et al.,  ). In general individuals vary in their anatomical brain structures and undergo the experiment with different mental states which may influence their brain responses (Huettel et al.,  ). \n\nTo date, there is also evidence for differences in the vocal processing and in particular in speech perception between genders from both behavioral (Hall,  ; Skuk and Schweinberger,  ) and previous fMRI studies (Shaywitz et al.,  ; Schirmer et al.,  ,  ,  ; Junger et al.,  ). These studies found activation differences in frontal brain regions (Schirmer et al.,  ; Junger et al.,  ) and the left posterior MTG and the angular gyrus (Junger et al.,  ). The deviation of the current results in terms of identified brain regions may be due to the different experimental design and computed contrasts, the different applied criteria (e.g., mask), number of included participants and implemented analysis methods. Future studies should further aim to elucidate the relationships between behavioral and functional activation differences. However, the current study shows that the choice of fMRI analysis method (e.g., MVPA) is of relevance when considering subtle between-gender differences. \n\nRegarding the current study, it would be interesting to separate the different vocal categories in the analysis (e.g., by speaker: female/male adults vs. infants/babies) and to perform a behavioral task in order to link differences in brain activation to behavior of the listener. Furthermore, it would be interesting for future studies to take into account more specific aspects of voice quality, which were not considered in the current study. Even subtle differences in phonation (e.g., whispery voice, harshness of a voice), articulation (e.g., vowel space) and or prosody (e.g., pitch variability, loudness, tempo) are critical aspects of voice processing and could be investigated using similar methodical approaches. Apart from studying differences between women and men, also other listener characteristics, such as differences between young and elderly participants, different nationalities and/or familiarity with the presented voices/stimuli should be considered. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nMale and female participants were similar in their pattern of activity differences in response to vocal vs. nonvocal sounds in the TVA of the auditory cortex. Yet, MVPA revealed several regions of significant gender differences in classification performance between female and male listeners: in these regions the distributed pattern of local activity from female participants allowed significantly better vocal/nonvocal classification than that of male participants; no region showed the opposite male > female difference. The neuronal mechanims underlying the observed differences remain unclear. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any

However, the neural bases of these sex differences remain under-investigated. Here, by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a variant of the Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MIDT), we examined sex differences in the neural responses to wins and losses and how individual reward and punishment sensitivity modulates these regional activities. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThirty-sex men and 27 women participated in the fMRI study. We assessed sensitivity to punishment (SP) and sensitivity to reward (SR) with the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ). In the MIDT, participants pressed a button to collect reward ($1, 1\u00a2, or nil), with the reaction time window titrated across trials so participants achieved a success rate of approximately 67%. We processed the Imaging data with published routines and evaluated the results with a corrected threshold. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWomen showed higher SP score than men and men showed higher SR score than women. Men relative to women showed higher response to the receipt of dollar or cent reward in bilateral orbitofrontal and visual cortex. Men as compared to women also showed higher response to dollar loss in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex. Further, in whole-brain regressions, women relative to men demonstrated more significant modulation by SP in the neural responses to wins and larger wins, and the sex differences were confirmed by slope tests. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nTogether, men showed higher SR and neural sensitivity to both wins, large or small, and losses than women. Individual differences in SP were associated with diminished neural responses to wins and larger wins in women only. These findings highlight how men and women may differ in reward-related brain activations in the MIDT and add to the imaging literature of sex differences in cognitive and affective functions. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \n### Reward processing in health and illness \n  \nReward-directed behavior is fundamental to survival and well-being [ ]. We strive to obtain primary (food, water, sex) and secondary (money, social approval) rewards [ ,  ]. Reward-seeking behavior engages neural circuits central to motivation and learning [ ,  ]. Numerous studies have identified the ventral tegmental area, ventral striatum (VS), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and anterior cingulate cortex as key regions for reward processing [ \u2013 ]. These structures integrate motivational and cognitive processes to support reward-seeking behavior [ ,  ,  ]. Further, individuals vary in how they respond to reward-related contingencies [ ], and men appear to be more sensitive to reward whereas women are more sensitive to punishment [ ,  ]. \n\nMany neuropsychiatric conditions implicate motivation deficits and reward processing dysfunction. For instance, anhedonia and compulsive drug seeking represent core symptoms of major depression and substance use disorders (SUDs), respectively, and implicate dysfunction of the reward circuitry [ ,  ]. Studies have consistently found reduced striatal response to reward anticipation and feedback [ ] and impaired learning of reward contingencies [ ] in patients with depression. The neural deficits correlate positively with anhedonia and negatively with treatment outcome [ ,  ,  ]. Chronic pain is frequently comorbid with depression and associated with deficits in reward responses [ ]. Substance misuse alters the salience of natural reinforcers and compromises self-control of immediate gratification, perpetuating drug seeking [ ,  \u2013 ]. Adolescents exposed prenatally to maternal cigarette smoking are observed to have a weaker bilateral VS response to reward anticipation [ ]. Importantly, many of these neuropsychiatric conditions demonstrate sex differences in their clinical profiles and etiological processes, with, for instance, women more vulnerable to depression and men to SUDs. Thus, it is important to better understand how men and women process reward differently. \n\n\n### Sex differences in reward and punishment processing \n  \nBiological, including hormonal, and socio-cultural factors may all account for sex differences in reward sensitivity and reward-directed behavior [ ,  ]. Indeed, the literature is mixed regarding sex differences in reward-related behavior and the neural processes underlying such differences. For example, some studies showed that women relative to men were better at delaying gratification [ ,  ], but others showed no sex differences [ ]. A study in rodents reported no sex difference in reward-guided associative learning across multiple paradigms. However, females appeared to be faster in learning to avoid punishment and, after learning, exhibited higher sensitivity than males to probabilistic punishment but less sensitive when punishment could be avoided with certainty [ ]. Women compared to men tended to pick decks with lower frequency of punishment on a gambling task [ ]. In a study combining electroencephalography (EEG) and a guessing task with both reward and punishment feedback, boys showed lower feedback-related negativity (FRN) and less behavioral changes following punishment [ ]. Further, girls but not boys demonstrated FRN to punishment in correlation with a reward sensitivity trait. In another EEG study of an incentive delay task, boys relative to girls showed less stimulus-preceding negativity in anticipation of punishment and greater feedback P3 to monetary than social reward [ ]. These findings are consistent with a literature of higher female sensitivity to loss, punishment or other negative feedback [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nIn contrast, visual sexual stimuli activated the reward system in both sexes whereas the VS was involved in men but not women in supporting the distractor effects of the stimuli on line orientation judgment [ ]. Adolescent boys relative to girls showed greater VS activation during reward processing in a risky decision making task, made a higher percentage of risky selections, and self-reported greater motivation to earn money than girls [ ]. Studying the perceived value of monetary vs. social rewards using a monetary/social incentive delay task, another group reported activation of a wider mesolimbic network in response to anticipation of monetary reward in men and in anticipation of both monetary and social reward in women, in accord with their reaction time performance [ ]. In a recent work of a reward go/no-go task, men exhibited greater arousal in response to \u201cgo\u201d action (predominating monetary wins), and the arousal better predicted go success rate, as compared to women [ ]. On the other hand, women were better than men in learning from positive (but not negative) feedback in a probabilistic selection task [ ]. In another study of the Human Connectome Project data, women relative to men showed more suppression of the default mode circuit and higher activation of the dorsal attention circuit during exposure to both reward and punishment, suggesting enhanced saliency of both reward and punishment in women [ ]. Thus, sex differences in reward-related processing appear to depend on the nature of rewarding stimuli and behavioral contingency. \n\n\n### The effects of reward and punishment sensitivity on reward-related processing \n  \nIn addition to sex, individuals may also vary in reward-related behavioral and neural processes because of distinct reward and punishment sensitivity. Sensitivity to reward scores correlated positively with reactivity to erotic pictures in the left OFC, left insula, and right VS [ ]. In a study of reinforcement learning, individual differences in reward sensitivity were positively associated with bilateral VS activation during receipt of reward, while differences in punishment sensitivity were negatively associated with left dorsal striatal activity during loss anticipation and with right lateral OFC activation during loss feedback [ ]. Another study examined three groups of people, each with low, medium, and high reward sensitivity, in a working memory task with sub- and supra-liminal stimuli. Individuals with medium reward sensitivity improved performance with high reward in both subliminal and supraliminal conditions, whereas the effect of reward was stronger in the supraliminal than subliminal condition for those with high reward sensitivity scores [ ]. The latter findings highlighted complex effects of individual reward sensitivity on cognitive performance incentivized by monetary reward. Investigators have also associated sensitivity to punishment with higher insula activity during feedback of social loss in a social incentive delay task in people with subthreshold depression [ ]. On the other hand, despite its wide use in the imaging literature, no studies of the monetary incentive delay task (MIDT) have examined how neural responses to monetary wins or losses may vary with individual sensitivity to reward or to punishment. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Aim, design and setting of the study \n  \nThe present study aims to characterize sex differences in cerebral responses to reward anticipation and feedback and whether women and men differ in the influences of individual reward and punishment sensitivity on these neural processes. On the basis of the literature, we broadly hypothesized higher SR in men relative to women and reward circuit responses in correlation with SR in both men and women. We would also explore how SP modulated neural response to wins and losses and potential sex differences in SP modulation. To these ends we contrasted men and women in regional responses to reward anticipation and feedback in neurotypical populations. We performed linear regression to identify how these regional responses may vary according to individual SR and SP and examined the sex differences in these correlations with slope tests. Understanding sex differences in reward processing would provide information for translational studies to examine sex-specific neural markers of clinical conditions that implicate reward processing dysfunction. \n\n\n### Subjects and assessments \n  \nSixty-three healthy adults (27 women; 22\u201355 or 37\u2009\u00b1\u200911, mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, years of age) participated in this study. All subjects were healthy with no current use of prescription medications. None reported a history of head injury or neurological illness. Other exclusion criteria included current or past Axis I Disorders including dependence on a psychoactive substance, according to DSM-IV. All participants were evaluated with the Sensitivity to Reward and Sensitivity to Punishment Questionnaire (SPSRQ) [ ]. The SPSRQ contains 48 yes\u2013no items, half concerning the scale for behavioral impulsivity/responsiveness to reward and half concerning the scale for behavioral avoidance in response to potentially adverse consequences. Scores were obtained by totaling the number of yes-answers in each scale, with a higher sub-score each indicating higher sensitivity to reward (SR) and sensitivity to punishment (SP). Table   summarizes subject characteristics.   \nSubject characteristics \n  \n SR   sensitivity to reward,   SP   sensitivity to punishment \n\np\u2009<\u20090.05, two-sample t test \n  \n\nThe Human Investigation Committee at Yale University School of Medicine approved the study and all subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation. \n\n\n### Monetary incentive delay task (MIDT) \n  \nIn the MIDT (Fig.\u00a0 a), a bet (a dollar, a cent, or no money, randomly intermixed) appeared on the screen at the beginning of each trial. After a randomized fore-period between 1 and 5\u00a0s (uniform distribution), a target box was shown for a short period (response window, see below). Subjects were told to press a button as quickly as possible to collect the money (win) before the target box disappeared. An accurate trial was defined by a button press before disappearance of the target box. Otherwise, subjects would lose the bet, with the amount deducted from the total win. A premature button press prior to the appearance of the target box terminated the trial, and similarly resulted in loss. Feedback was shown on the screen after each trial to indicate the amount of money won or lost. Approximately 42% of all trials were dollar trials, 42% were cent trials, and \u201cno money\u201d constituted the remaining trials. The inter-trial-interval was 1.5\u00a0s. The response window started at 300\u00a0ms, and was stair-cased for each trial type (dollar/cent/no money) separately; for instance, if the subject succeeded at two successive dollar trials, the window decreased by 30\u00a0ms, making it more difficult to win again; conversely, if a subject failed for two successive trials, the response window increased by 30\u00a0ms, making it easier to win. We anticipated that the subjects would win in approximately 67% each for dollar and cent trials. Each subject completed two 10-min runs of the task. Across subjects, there were 184\u2009\u00b1\u20094 (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) trials in a study.   \nBehavioral paradigm and performance. a Monetary incentive delay task: A bet (a dollar, a cent, or no money) appeared at the beginning of each trial.

Subjects were told to press a button as quickly as possible to collect the money in the target box (win) before it disappeared. Otherwise, subjects lost the bet, with the amount deducted from their total winnings. A premature button-press prior to the appearance of the target box terminated the trial, and similarly resulted in loss. A feedback window was shown on the screen after each trial to indicate the amount of money won or lost. b Accuracy rate and c RT of dollar, cent and no money (nil) trials (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) for men and women \n  \n\n\n### Imaging protocol, data preprocessing, and modeling \n  \nBrain images were collected using multiband imaging with a 3-T MR scanner (Siemens Trio, Erlangen, Germany). Conventional T1-weighted spin echo sagittal anatomical images were acquired for slice localization. Anatomical 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) image were next obtained with spin echo imaging in the axial plane parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC\u2013PC) line with repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20091900\u00a0ms, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20092.52\u00a0ms, bandwidth\u2009=\u2009170\u00a0Hz/pixel, field of view\u2009=\u2009250\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u00a0mm, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, 176 slices with slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u00a0mm and no gap. Functional, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals were then acquired with a single-shot gradient echo echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence. Fifty-one axial slices parallel to the AC\u2013PC line covering the whole brain were acquired with TR\u2009=\u20091000\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u00a0ms, bandwidth\u2009=\u20092290\u00a0Hz/pixel, flip angle\u2009=\u200962\u00b0, field of view\u2009=\u2009210\u2009\u00d7\u2009210\u00a0mm, matrix\u2009=\u200984\u2009\u00d7\u200984, 51 slices with slice thickness\u2009=\u20092.5\u00a0mm and no gap, multiband acceleration factor\u2009=\u20093. \n\nData were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8). Individual subjects\u2019 images were corrected for motion and slice timing. A mean functional image volume was constructed for individual subjects per run from the realigned image volumes, co-registered with the high-resolution structural image, and segmented for normalization with affine registration followed by nonlinear transformation [ ,  ]. The normalization parameters determined for the structure volume were applied to the corresponding functional volumes for individual subjects. The images were then smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8\u00a0mm at Full Width at Half Maximum. \n\nWe examined event-related BOLD signals in a general linear model, where we distinguished the cue onset of dollar, cent, and \u201cno money\u201d or nil trials, and the feedback onset of dollar win, dollar loss, cent win, cent loss, and nil. A statistical analytical design was constructed for each individual subject, with the onsets of individual trials convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and with the temporal derivatives of the canonical HRF and entered as regressors in the model [ ]. Realignment parameters in all six dimensions were also entered in the model. Serial autocorrelation caused by aliased cardiovascular and respiratory effects was corrected by a first-degree autoregressive model. The GLM estimated the component of variance explained by each of the regressors. \n\nIn group level or random effects analyses, we employed one-sample t tests to examine whole-brain responses to individual contrasts (see below) in men and women combined and two-sample t tests to examine sex differences in these contrasts with age and RT differences, as specified by the contrasts, as covariates. To investigate the neural correlates of SR and SP, we conducted whole-brain linear regressions of these contrasts on SR and SP, with age and RT differences, as specified by the contrasts, as covariates for men and women combined as well as separately. For sex-specific findings, we defined the functional clusters identified from linear regressions in men and women alone as regions of interest, extracted the \u03b2 estimates for all subjects, and performed slope tests to examine sex differences in the correlations [ ]. Note that the slope test for sex difference does not represent \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d or circular analysis, as the slope tests may confirm or refute sex differences [ ,  ]. \n\nAll models were evaluated with a threshold combining voxel p\u2009<\u20090.001, uncorrected and cluster p\u2009<\u20090.05 family-wise error (FWE) corrected, following current reporting standards. Voxels with peak activity were indicated with Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates. We have also deposited the unthresholded maps of all contrasts on Neurovalut ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral performance \n  \nFigure\u00a0 b, c show the accuracy rate (AR) and reaction time (RT) of dollar, cent, and nil trials. For both men and women, the ARs were close to 67%, suggesting the success of the staircase procedure. For men, the AR ranged from 40 to 71% for dollar, 41 to 71% for cent, and 41 to 70% for nil trials. For women, the AR ranged from 55 to 71% for dollar, 43 to 69% for cent and 49 to 69% for nil trials. There were no significant sex differences in the AR of dollar (t \u2009=\u2009\u2212\u00a00.76; p\u2009=\u20090.45), cent (t \u2009= \u2009\u2212\u00a00.37; p\u2009=\u20090.70), or nil (t \u2009=\u2009 \u2212\u00a00.73; p\u2009=\u20090.47) trials or in the RT of dollar (t \u2009=\u20090.05; p\u2009=\u20090.96), cent (t \u2009= \u2009\u2212\u00a00.04; p\u2009=\u20090.97), or nil (t \u2009=\u20090.04; p\u2009=\u20090.97) trials. \n\nMen showed higher sensitivity to reward (SR) score than women, and, in contrast, women showed higher sensitivity to punishment (SP) score than men (Table  ). We examined the relationship between behavioral performance and SR and SP for men and women together and separately. In linear regressions, SR score was positively correlated with the AR of dollar trials in men\u2009+\u2009women (r \u2009=\u20090.28, p\u2009=\u20090.02) and in women (r \u2009=\u20090.52, p\u2009=\u20090.006). SR score was also positively correlated with the AR of cent trials in men\u2009+\u2009women (r \u2009=\u20090.33, p\u2009=\u20090.008) and in women (r \u2009=\u20090.51, p\u2009=\u20090.007). SR score was negatively correlated with the RT of cent trials in women (r \u2009=\u2009 \u2212\u00a00.44, p\u2009=\u20090.02), SP score was positively correlated with the RT of dollar trials in women (r \u2009=\u20090.50, p\u2009=\u20090.007), and SP was positively correlated with the RT of cent trials in men\u2009+\u2009women (r \u2009=\u20090.28, p\u2009=\u20090.03) (Fig.\u00a0 ). The r and p values of all correlations are shown in Table  . However, although women appeared to show more significant correlations between SR/SP scores and performance measures, relative to men, the slope tests did not reveal significant sex differences in any of these correlations (all p\u2019s\u2009\u2265\u20090.47).   \nLinear regressions between SPSRQ scores for men, women, and all, for accuracy rate (AR) and RT of dollar and cent trials \n    \nLinear regressions between performance measures and SR/SP \n  \nAccuracy rate (AR, %) and reaction time (RT, ms) and sensitivity to reward (SR) and sensitivity to punishment (SP) scores for men and women combined (M\u2009+\u2009F), men (M), and women (F). *p\u2009<\u20090.05.

Anticipation of a dollar reward involved activation of the medial visual cortical areas, including the cuneus, dorsal striatum, supplementary motor areas, thalamus, and cerebellum. In contrast, anticipation of a cent reward involved \u201cdeactivation\u201d of a large swath of medial and lateral visual cortical areas, bilateral inferior frontal cortex, and cerebellum. In a covariance analysis with age and RT differences as covariates, men and women did not show significant differences in activation to reward anticipation during dollar vs. nil, cent vs. nil, or dollar vs. cent trials.   \nRegional activations during anticipation to win a dollar vs. nil; b cent vs. nil; and c dollar vs. cent.

Neurological orientation: right is right \n  \n\n\n### Sex differences in regional activations to feedback (win or loss) \n  \nIn a one-sample t-test, we evaluated regional activations to dollar win vs. nil, cent win vs. nil, dollar vs. cent win, dollar loss vs. nil, cent loss vs. nil, and dollar vs. cent loss in men and women combined. These results are shown in Fig.\u00a0 . Both dollar and cent wins engaged higher activation of the ventral striatum (VS) and visual cortical areas. Dollar wins engaged additional brain regions, including the medial orbitofrontal cortex, caudate nucleus and the cerebellum. In contrast, both dollar and cent losses engaged higher activation of bilateral anterior insula and medial frontal cortex, including the anterior cingulate gyrus, and left somatomotor cortex.   \nRegional activations to outcomes: a dollar win vs. nil; b cent win vs. nil; c dollar vs. cent win; d dollar loss vs. nil; e cent loss vs. nil; and f dollar vs. cent loss.

Voxel p\u2009<\u20090.001, uncorrected. Neurological orientation: right is right \n  \n\nIn covariance analyses to compare men and women with age and RT differences as covariates for each of these contrasts, we observed sex differences in activation (men\u2009>\u2009women) in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and occipital cortex for dollar win\u2009>\u2009nil (Fig.\u00a0 a), and in the left frontal/temporal Rolandic operculum for cent win\u2009>\u2009nil (Fig.\u00a0 b). Compared to women, men also showed higher activation to dollar loss\u2009>\u2009nil in similar areas of the bilateral OFC and to cent loss\u2009>\u2009nil in the right precentral gyrus. Clusters meeting cluster p\u2009<\u20090.05 FWE are summarized in Table  .

None of the regressions revealed significant findings in men and women combined or alone. \n\nLikewise, we examined how regional responses to feedbacks varied with individual differences in SR and SP. For each of the six contrasts, we performed a linear regression with both SR and SP scores as regressors and years of age and RT difference, as specified by the contrast, as covariates for men and women combined as well as separately. In men alone, the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCC/PCu) showed activation to dollar win vs. nil in positive correlation with SR score. In women alone, right middle frontal and postcentral gyri showed activation to dollar win vs. nil in negative correlation with SP score. Women also showed activation to dollar vs. cent win in the right anterior insula, left superior frontal gyrus and right temporal gyrus in negative correlation with SP score. These clusters are shown in Fig.\u00a0 . Some of these regional activities were also observed in men and women combined. These clusters are summarized in Table  .   \nSex differences in the regression of regional activities with SR/SP scores. The statistics are summarized in the main text. a \u03b2 contrast \u201cdollar win vs. nil\u201d of the PCC/PCu was positively correlated with SR score in men but not in women; however, the slope test failed to confirm the sex difference (z\u2009=\u20091.88, p\u2009=\u20090.06). b The \u03b2 contrast \u201cdollar win vs. nil\u201d of the right middle frontal and postcentral gyri was negatively correlated with the SP score in women but not in men, and the slope test confirmed the sex difference in the correlation (z\u2009=\u20093.33, p\u2009=\u20090.0009). c The \u03b2 contrast \u201cdollar vs. cent win\u201d of the right anterior insula and temporal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with the SP score in women but not in men, and the slope test confirmed the sex difference (z\u2009=\u20094.46, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) \n    \nRegression analysis with SP and SR score \n  \nVoxel   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected; cluster p\u2009<\u20090.05 FWE; R: right; L: left; G: gyrus; PCC: posterior cingulate cortex; PCu: precuneus; IPL: inferior parietal lobule; dmPFC: dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; OFC: orbitofrontal cortex; SFG: superior frontal gyrus \n  \n\nTo examine sex differences, we performed slope tests [ ] on the six individual clusters with regional activities in correlation with the SR or SP score in men or women alone. The results for the individual clusters identified from the same contrast were statistically identical and thus these clusters were combined in slope tests. The results showed that the \u03b2 contrast \u201cdollar win vs. nil\u201d of the PCC/PCu was positively correlated with SR score in men (r \u2009=\u20090.665, p\u2009=\u20091.81e-05) but not in women (r \u2009=\u20090.277, p\u2009=\u20090.180); however, the slope test failed to confirm the sex difference (z\u2009=\u20091.88, p\u2009=\u20090.06). The \u03b2 contrast \u201cdollar win vs. nil\u201d of the right middle frontal and postcentral gyri was negatively correlated with the SP score in women (r \u2009= \u2009\u2212\u00a00.751, p\u2009=\u20091.53e\u221205) but not in men (r \u2009=\u2009 \u2009\u2212\u00a00.080, p\u2009=\u20090.653), and the slope test confirmed the sex difference in the correlation (z\u2009=\u20093.33, p\u2009=\u20090.0009). The \u03b2 contrast \u201cdollar vs. cent win\u201d of the right anterior insula and temporal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with the SP score in women (r \u2009=\u2009 \u2009\u2212\u00a00.847, p\u2009=\u20099.24e\u221208) but not in men (r \u2009=\u2009 \u2009\u2212\u00a00.024, p\u2009=\u20090.894), and the slope test confirmed the sex difference (z\u2009=\u20094.46, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The regressions for men and women together and separately are shown in Fig.\u00a0 . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe studied sex differences in reward processing in a sample of 63 healthy adults (27 women) using a variant monetary incentive delay task (MIDT). The volunteers made a timed response to win \u201cthe bet\u201d of $1, \u00a21, or nil. We examined how sex influenced behavioral performance and neural activation to monetary reward anticipation and feedback. Our results show that while there are no sex differences during reward anticipation, male sex is associated with higher activity to feedback of winning $1 (vs. nil) in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and visual cortex, as well as higher activity of losing $1 (vs. nil) in largely the same region of bilateral OFC. Men relative to women also showed higher activation in the left frontal/temporal Rolandic operculum during \u00a21 wins vs. nil. These results suggest that men have heightened neural sensitivity to receiving monetary reward of higher or lower magnitude than females and that both wins and losses of large reward were more salient for men, relative to women. As quantified by the SPSRQ, men showed higher sensitivity to reward (SR) and women showed higher sensitivity to punishment, in keeping with the literature [ ,  ,  ]. Further, women showed more significant modulation by individual SP in the neural responses to wins and larger wins. We highlight the main findings in the discussion below. \n\n### Lack of sex differences in response to reward anticipation \n  \nOur results showed that there were no significant sex differences in neural activation to reward anticipation. Reward anticipation is central to associative learning, and this finding is broadly consistent with animal behavioral studies reporting no sex differences in reward guided associative learning in male and female rodents [ ]. In human imaging literature, both men and women have been found to activate a wide neural network to anticipation of monetary reward [ ]. Similarly enhanced activation in the VS, ventral tegmental area, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex was observed in both sexes in anticipation of smiling faces of the opposite sex [ ]. No sex differences were found in activation of the reward circuits during anticipation of sexually explicit materials [ \u2013 ]. However, one study showed increased activation in men vs. women of the ventral putamen during reward anticipation in a gambling task. This same study found that women\u2019s reward circuit was more reactive to anticipation of uncertain reward during the mid-follicular, when estrogen levels are high, than luteal menstrual phase [ ]. Thus, our findings need to be interpreted with caution because of a limited sample size and lack of control of menstrual phase in female participants. It is also likely that sex differences or the lack thereof in regional responses to reward anticipation may depend on the behavioral contingencies; i.e., whether the motor decision involves learning or simply guessing or a speedy response to acquire the reward. \n\n\n### Sex differences in response to feedback and reward/punishment sensitivity \n  \nBehaviorally, while men and women each showed higher SR and SP score, in accord with earlier reports using the SPSRQ [ ,  ], SP and SR score appeared to influence task performance in both sexes. However, men and women differed in regional responses to reward. Relative to women, men engaged bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and visual cortex to a greater extent in response to dollar win vs. nil and the same regions in bilateral OFC in response to dollar loss vs. nil. Men relative to women also showed higher activity in the left frontal/temporal Rolandic operculum to cent win vs. nil. The OFC is involved in learning and optimal decision-making [ ], encoding motivational salience of stimuli to support approach behavior [ ,  ], and integrating stimulus attributes and emotional value [ \u2013 ]. As part of the association cortex, the frontal/temporal Rolandic operculum is implicated in thought, planning and learning of reward contingencies [ \u2013 ]. Thus, these findings suggest greater male sensitivity to monetary reward, in accord with the literature. For instance, an event-related potential study in adolescents reported higher feedback P3 amplitude in boys, as compared to girls, in response to monetary rewards [ ]. Another study reported a preferential response of the OFC to attractive vs. unattractive faces in men but not in women [ ]. \n\nWomen showed regional responses to wins and larger wins in negative correlation with SP. These areas include the right middle frontal gyrus and anterior insula, each part of the ventral attention and salience networks [ ,  ]. In contrast, these regional responses were not correlated with SP scores in men and the responses of these same regions to losses did not correlate significantly with SP scores in women. Thus, higher neural sensitivity to wins appears to be a marker of individual variation in SP in women. Conversely, although falling short of statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.06), men seem to demonstrate higher neural sensitivities to wins in relation to SR scores. Thus, reward-related neural responses and behavior may be modulated by distinct personality traits across the two sexes. \n\nIn our previous study of the MIDT task, activation of the right caudate head, along with the SMA and right anterior insula during reward anticipation, was correlated with diminished differences in RT collecting a large vs. small reward, suggesting its role in reward-based cognitive motor control [ ]. Although one would expect individual SR or SP may be reflected in behavioral performance, we did not observe a significant correlation between the trait and any performance measures in men and women combined or examined separately. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to revisit this issue. \n\n\n### Limitations and additional considerations \n  \nA number of limitations need to be considered for the study. First, we did not record the menstrual phase of women, which may have introduced variance to influence the current findings. Second, we did not study sex-based variation in general incentive salience. Men relative to women are more motivated by monetary reward; however, the current findings cannot be generalized to other (e.g., social) rewards or behavioral contingencies. Third, the sample size is relatively small to address sex differences. Thus, these findings should be considered preliminary. Finally, the current MIDT variant did not explicitly distinguish sessions where participants were expected to win vs. to lose. Thus, although it is reasonable that participants would expect to win in general (~\u200967%) and anticipation did involve regional activities typically implicated in the MIDT, we had no way to evaluate the trial-by-trial variation in the extent participants expected to win or to lose. It is perhaps also for this reason that we did not observe sex differences in anticipation-related activities or an impact of SR and SP traits on these activities. Again, these \u201cnegative\u201d results would need to be revaluated with a larger sample and paradigms that instruct anticipation to win vs. lose. \n\nA few additional issues are worth considering. We did not observe a similar pattern of responses (but of different magnitude) to anticipation of dollar and cent wins. In fact, the occipital cortex showed diametric responses between anticipation of dollar and cent wins, suggesting an effect of relativity\u2014large and small reward may not engage the same circuit in a linear fashion. Further, women appear to be more loss aversive than men [ ], and it remains to be seen to what extent loss aversion can be captured by punishment sensitivity and how sex differences in loss aversion may account for the current findings. More studies\u00a0with multiple behavioral paradigms [ ] are warranted to investigate these issues. \n\n\n### Perspectives and significance \n  \nMen and women differ in trait and neural sensitivity to reward and punishment. The literature nearly consistently finds men to be more sensitive than women to monetary reward. These heightened neural responses to monetary feedback involve the cognitive motor circuits, including the SMA and caudate nucleus, and would likely influence a wide range of reward-related behavior. The sex differences in reward and punishment sensitivity may have a greater impact on neural activation to reward processing and reward-related decision making than we were able to demonstrate with the data collected of the MIDT. It remains to be seen whether or how these behavioral and neural sensitivity manifest in other laboratory paradigms and real-life decision making. Further, it is unclear how genetic and sociocultural factors may contribute to the sex differences. Sex differences in the incidence and phenomenology of neuropsychiatric and behavioral disturbances such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse are known to be directly related to reward saliency processing and reward-based learning. It would be of significant interest to public health whether a gender-free or gender-less upbringing, now an emerging trend in child rearing, may alter the picture of sex differences in reward processing and in the susceptibility to neuropsychiatric illness that we find in our society today. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe replicated higher male sensitivity to reward and female sensitivity to punishment as evaluated by the SPSRQ. Although these individual differences did not translate to influence behavioral performance in the MIDT, likely due to a small sample size, men and women exhibited differences in neural responses to reward. Men show higher SR and neural sensitivity to the receipt of reward, big or small, and to loss, as compared to women. Women showed higher SP than men and individual differences in SP are reflected in regional brain responses to wins and larger wins in women but not in men.

Furthermore, whether individuals with AN process images of their own face differently to healthy individuals has thus far not been investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate facial affect processing and the processing of one\u2019s own face through measures of emotion identification, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eyetracking. \n\n Methods:   Twenty-four females with AN and 25 matched healthy control participants were presented with an implicit emotion processing task during fMRI and eyetracking, followed by an explicit emotion identification task. \n\n Results:   The AN group were found to \u2018hyperscan\u2019 stimuli and avoided visually attending to salient features of their own face images. Results of the fMRI revealed increased activity to own face stimuli in AN in the right inferior and middle temporal gyri, and right lingual gyrus. AN participants were not found to display emotion identification deficits to the standard emotional face stimuli. \n\n Discussion:   The findings are discussed in terms of increased anxiety to disorder-relevant stimuli in AN. Potential clinical implications are discussed in relation to the use of eyetracking techniques to improve the perception of self in AN. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAnorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric condition characterized by a significantly low body weight, a fear of weight gain and a disturbance in the experience of one\u2019s own body weight or shape ( ). A common pathognomonic psychological factor in AN is the disturbance of body image ( ). AN also significantly overlaps with anxiety disorders in terms of symptoms and phenomenology, particularly obsessive compulsive disorder ( ;  ). Additionally, AN has long been associated with deficits in the perception of emotion; in her pioneering work,   observed a marked deficiency in the description of feelings and emotional responses in patients with AN. Later research has linked these deficiencies to the construct of alexithymia, which is defined as a difficulty in identifying and describing subjective feelings, a difficulty in distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal, an externally oriented cognitive style, and a lack of imaginal capacity and fantasy ( ). Increased rates of alexithymia have been consistently reported in AN ( ;  ;  ), though whether individuals with AN have difficulty in the processing of other people\u2019s emotions has not been significantly elucidated. \n\nA number of studies have reported that AN patients perform poorly on tasks probing human face emotion identification (also referred to as \u2018facial affect processing\u2019). Some authors have reported that this deficit was not specific to any particular emotion ( ), while others have found deficits that are specific to the identification of surprise ( ;  ), sadness ( ;  ), disgust ( ), and fear ( ). In only one study of which we are aware, the authors did not find any emotion identification deficit in AN ( ). The consistency of these findings has prompted researchers to explore the neurobiological basis of this impairment in AN using neuroimaging techniques. \n\nTo date, only two published functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have investigated facial affect processing in AN.   found that AN patients exhibited increased blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation in the right fusiform gyrus in response to mildly happy, prototypically happy, and neutral human face expressions compared to controls. In contrast,   did not find any group differences with their paradigm that used fearful and happy human face expressions. However, the findings of these studies have limited utility as neither contrasted the affect images with neutral affect images to control for differential between group face processing   per se  ;   contrasted the emotions to a baseline (fixation cross) and   contrasted fearful and happy conditions with one another. \n\nAnother related set of studies have analyzed visual scanpaths and have revealed critical information for understanding face emotion processing in a range of psychiatric conditions. During face stimulus processing, healthy individuals focus on salient features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth ( ), whereas patients with psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, show reduced visual attention to these features ( ;  ). Furthermore, although poorer attention to salient features has been found in psychiatric populations such as schizophrenia during implicit emotion processing tasks, typical attention to salient features has been found when explicit task instructions are given ( ). Individuals with psychiatric conditions also show different scanpath strategies: those with anxiety disorders such as social anxiety disorder \u2018hyperscan\u2019 (increased scanpath lengths with fixations of shorter duration) face stimuli ( ), whereas those with schizophrenia show a restricted scanpath of fewer fixations of longer duration, and reduced scanpath lengths ( ). Whether individuals with AN also exhibit discrepant visual scanpath behavior when viewing face stimuli relative to healthy individuals, has thus far not been thoroughly investigated. During a free-viewing task where participants were presented with whole body stimuli and face stimuli,   reported reduced attention to the eye region of face stimuli, and less time visually attending face regions when whole bodies were presented in AN. However, the findings of that study are limited as no attempt was made to standardize the stimuli acquired from a dating website.  , on the other hand, presented participants images of their own bodies photographed in a black leotard and reported that while healthy controls spent relatively the same amount of time focusing on four interest areas (face, chest, abdomen, and legs), individuals with AN spent more time looking at the their legs and abdomen and less time looking at the face, suggesting an avoidance of fixating one\u2019s own face in AN. \n\nThe aim of the current study was to investigate the processing of emotional faces of others, and faces of self, in AN. Participants performed an implicit emotion processing task that involved gender identification of stimuli while undergoing fMRI and eyetracking, and an explicit emotion identification task outside the scanner during eyetracking. Functional imaging studies of emotional face perception are typically performed as implicit tasks, such as gender decision tasks, rather than explicit tasks as they are less cognitively demanding and do not interfere with emotional processing. As explicit tasks have a higher cognitive demand, more frontal areas are involved and it is more difficult to observe the areas involved in emotion processing ( ;  ). Performing the task both implicitly and explicitly also allowed for the investigation of emotion perception and scanpaths under different conditions. As scanning behaviors have not previously been specifically investigated in AN, individuals with AN were expected to exhibit similar scanning behaviors to related conditions such as anxiety disorders, namely, hyperscanning of face stimuli during both tasks (i.e., increased fixations of shorter duration). Similarly to other psychiatric conditions, we further hypothesized that AN participants would show an avoidance of salient features of the emotional face stimuli during the implicit task. As typical attention to salient features has been found when explicit task instructions are given in populations that demonstrate poor attention to salient features during implicit tasks ( ), groups were not expected to differ in areas of attentional focus during the explicit task. In relation to participants\u2019 own face stimuli and given the avoidance of looking at one\u2019s own face as reported by  , the AN group were hypothesized to show less attention to salient features during both tasks. Individuals with AN were also expected to show emotion identification deficits to face stimuli displaying negative emotion, but were not expected to show emotion recognition difficulties to their own face when they were asked to display a neutral expression. Related to this hypothesis, the AN group were expected to manifest reduced activity in limbic areas of the brain to negative affect stimuli, relative to neutral control faces; and to show reduced activity to stimuli of their own face in frontoparietal brain areas which are involved in the processing of ones\u2019 own face ( ). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nThis study was approved by the human research ethics departments at The University of Melbourne, Swinburne University of Technology, The Melbourne Clinic, The Austin Hospital, and St Vincent\u2019s Hospital; all in Melbourne, VIC, Australia. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants. All procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. \n\n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-four right-handed individuals with AN and 25 healthy control (HC) individuals were recruited for the study. One participant in the AN group declined to have her own face included among the stimuli and her data were not included in the analysis. A programming error resulted in one HC participant being presented with too few own face stimuli and her data were excluded. Technical difficulties encountered with use of the eyetracking equipment in the MRI resulted in the data of three AN participants and three HC participants being excluded, allowing eyetracking analyses to be conducted on 20 AN and 21 HC participants. All 23 AN and 24 HC participants\u2019 data were included in the fMRI and emotion identification analyses. \n\nHCs were recruited through public advertisements, whereas AN participants were recruited through public advertisements, the Body Image and Eating Disorders Treatment and Recovery Service at the Austin and St Vincent\u2019s Hospitals, and The Melbourne Clinic (all located in Melbourne, VIC, Australia). All participants were English speaking, had no history of significant brain injury or neurological condition, no significant ocular pathology and normal (or corrected to normal) visual acuity. Controls were required to have no history of an eating disorder or other mental illness; they were also required to not be taking any medications apart from hormonal contraceptives (11 HC participants were taking this medication). AN participants were instructed to continue with their normal medications, which were: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (10), atypical antipsychotics (10), benzodiazepines (5), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (3), hormonal contraceptives (3), melatonergic antidepressants (2), noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) (1), and cyclopyrrolones (1). Medications that patients were taking, such as benzodiazepines and atypical antipsychotics have been found to moderately reduce saccadic peak velocity ( ), but do not affect scanpaths to the best of our knowledge. \n\nThe Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, 5.0.0 (MINI;  ) was used to screen participants for major Axis I psychiatric disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). It was also used to confirm diagnoses of AN, with the exception of the amenorrhea criterion which is not included in DSM-5 criteria. AN was required to be the primary diagnosis of the AN group; participants with comorbid psychiatric conditions, other than psychotic conditions, were not excluded as this would not have represented a typical AN sample. \n\nPremorbid intelligence was estimated using the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR;  ). Eating disorder symptomatology was investigated with the Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q;  ) and alexithymia with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20;  ) (  Table   ). \n  \nParticipant information. \n    \n\n### Task \n  \nParticipants were presented with face stimuli from a standard set of black-and-white images, the Pictures of Facial Affect ( ). The stimuli consist of male and female images displaying the seven basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral. The stimuli chosen were those with the highest inter-rater agreement for all seven emotions. Four male and four female models displaying each emotion were presented. Participants were first presented with an implicit task while undergoing fMRI and eyetracking, followed by the explicit task which involved emotion identification and eyetracking. An implicit task was undertaken during fMRI as explicit tasks have a higher cognitive demand and more frontal areas involvement, making it more difficult to observe activity in areas involved in emotion processing ( ;  ). In the implicit task, participants were presented with each stimulus twice in a pseudorandom fashion, resulting in a total of 16 presentations of each emotion over two runs. In the explicit task, participants were shown each stimulus once, resulting in eight presentations per emotion over one run. Due to the extended length of the task in the MRI, participants were not presented with surprised faces in the implicit task as it is the most ambiguous emotion, having neither a positive or negative emotional valence. Participants were also pseudorandomly presented with a black-and-white image of their own face with a neutral expression, with 16 presentations during the implicit task and eight during the explicit task. Photographs of participants were taken by the researcher while participants were instructed to look straight ahead with a relaxed expression, similarly to a passport photograph. Participants\u2019 own face photographs were edited to match the properties of the Ekman face stimuli in terms of size and resolution, and were made black-and-white. \n\nIn the implicit task, faces were displayed pseudorandomly across emotions for 8000 ms on a white background, followed by a black 1\u00b0 fixation cross for 3000\u20134300 ms. Each photograph was 336 \u00d7 640 pixels, equalling 17 cm \u00d7 27.5 cm or 18 \u00d7 13\u00b0 at the eye. Participants were instructed simply to look at the face while it was on screen and to make a gender response with their right hand by clicking one of two buttons only when the fixation cross appeared following the face presentation. Long periods of fixation, between 10200 and 11400 ms were presented pseudorandomly throughout the task to increase BOLD signal variance by allowing the signal to return to baseline. Each of the two runs also began with a long period of fixation for 15000 ms. \n\nIn the explicit task, faces were again displayed for 8000 ms on a white background, equalling to 8 \u00d7 13\u00b0 to the eye. Prior to the presentation of each stimulus, a 1\u00b0 fixation cross appeared in the center of the screen. Following the presentation of each face stimulus, a forced-choice screen appeared on the monitor asking participants to identify the emotion displayed in the previous face from a list containing all of the emotions. The participants were given as much time as they required to make a response. \n\n\n### Data Acquisition and Analysis \n  \n#### Eyetracking \n  \nStimuli were presented through SR Research\u2019s Experiment Builder program, and eyetracking was recorded using a remote view eyetracker, the EyeLink1000 (SR Research, Mississauga, ON, Canada), monocularly at 500 Hz. The recorded data were analyzed with SR Research\u2019s analysis program, DataViewer. Areas of interest (AOIs) were defined as the eyes, nose and mouth. To investigate the proportion of fixations and fixation durations to salient features and non-salient features, two spatial-temporal parameters were calculated: the feature fixation index (FFI) and the feature duration index (FDI;  ). The FFI is derived by dividing the number of fixations to salient features minus the number of fixations to non-salient features by the total number of fixations. The FDI is derived in the same manner. Indices range from -1 to +1, with positive values indicating more fixations or longer durations to salient features, and negative values indicating more visual attention to non-salient features. \n\n\n#### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging \n  \nMagnetic resonance imaging scans were undertaken with the Siemens Tim Trio 3 tesla system with a 32 channel head coil at Swinburne University of Technology (Melbourne, VIC, Australia). During each functional run of active task performance, 1080 T2 -weighted images were acquired axially parallel to the AC\u2013PC line using an interleaved multiband sequence (multiband acceleration factor = 4, bandwidth = 25988 Hz/Px, repetition time (TR) = 710 ms, echo-time (TE) = 30 ms, echo-spacing = 0.51 ms, flip-angle = 52\u00b0, field of view = 222 mm, voxel resolution = 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm, slice thickness = 3 mm, number of slices = 44). Multiband acquisition sequences were derived from the Human Connectome Project ( ). A T1-weighted image was acquired sagitally for anatomical reference (bandwidth = 170 Hz/Px, TR = 1900 ms, TE = 2.52 ms, echo spacing = 7.5 ms, flip angle = 9\u00b0, field-of-view = 350 mm \u00d7 263 mm \u00d7 350 mm, voxel resolution = 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm, slice thickness = 1 mm). \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging data pre-processing and statistical analyses were performed using SPM8, through Matlab R2014a (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Image pre-processing included image realignment, then coregistration of the T1 image to a mean realigned functional image created during realignment. The co-registered T1 image was normalized to the T1 template supplied with SPM8 Montreal Neuroimaging Institute (MNI), then the parameters of this transformation were applied to realigned functional images. The normalized functional images were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm \u00d7 8 mm \u00d7 8 mm. \n\n\n#### Statistical Analyses \n  \nFirst-level modeling was performed by fitting a convolved hemodynamic response function (HRF) and its temporal derivative separately to the onset times of angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad, neutral, and own faces (seven regressors plus their temporal derivative). After parameter estimation, each emotion parameter and the participants\u2019 own face parameter was contrasted with the neutral face parameter producing six contrast images (angry > neutral, sad > neutral, etc.). At the group level, these contrast images were first entered into one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) models for AN and HC groups separately to investigate within-group effects (results are presented in Supplementary Material). Group differences were interrogated with a mixed-effects ANOVA model using the flexible factorial option in SPM8. This model included a between-subjects   group   factor (two levels: patients vs. controls), a within subjects   condition   factor (six levels: angry > neutral, sad > neutral, etc.) and a   subject  s factor (number of levels equals the number of participants) that controlled for within-subject variability ( ). \n\n T  -statistic images were corrected for multiple comparisons using the random-field theory approach at the voxel and cluster levels (  p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected). The mixed-design analysis involved the investigation of a group by condition interaction, followed by simple effects comparing each condition between groups. \n\nFollowing the mixed-design analysis, clusters which resulted in significant differences between groups were defined as different regions of interests (ROIs) with the MarsBar toolbox ( ) run under Matlab R2014a. Contrast estimates for each ROI were correlated with eyetracking and behavioral data, and scores on the EDE-Q and TAS-20. \n\nPerformance on eyetracking components and emotion identification (rate of emotion identification errors) were compared with mixed design ANOVAs, following normality checking and the removal of outliers. Percentage data underwent an arcsine transformation prior to inclusion in ANOVAs. Violations of sphericity were corrected with a Greenhouse\u2013Geiser correction. For conditions in which groups significantly differed in emotion identification error rate, Mann\u2013Whitney   U   tests were carried out to identify which emotions were incorrectly reported as the data were not normally distributed. Pearson\u2019s correlation analyses were also performed between eyetracking data and behavioral data, and scores on the EDE-Q and TAS-20. For brevity, only significant interactions with group will be commented on in detail. Detailed results of eyetracking and fMRI analyses unrelated to group interactions are available as Supplementary Material. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral \n  \nFor rate of emotion identification errors, a 2 (group) \u00d7 8 (condition) mixed design ANOVA was undertaken (see Supplementary Table  ). The analysis revealed a significant main effect of condition [  F  (2.5,113.5) = 7.4,   p   < 0.001]. A significant main effect of group [  F  (1,46) = 5.2,   p   \u2264 0.05] and a significant interaction between group and condition were also found [  F  (2.5,113.5) = 4.6,   p   \u2264 0.01]. Within subjects contrasts revealed that groups did not significantly differ in emotion identification errors to any individual emotion, but AN participants made significantly more emotion identification errors to their own face [  F  (1,46) = 5.1,   p   \u2264 0.05]. When errors were made to own face emotion, analyses revealed that AN participants were more likely than controls to report their own face as sad [  U  (46) = 200.0, Z = -2.9,   p   \u2264 0.01], whereas control participants were more likely to correctly report their own neutral face as portraying a neutral expression [  U  (46) = 209.0,   Z   = -2.3,   p   \u2264 0.05] (see Supplementary Table  ). \n\n\n### Eyetracking \n  \nAverage fixation count, fixation duration, and saccade amplitude were analyzed in separate 2 (group) \u00d7 7 (condition) \u00d7 2 (task) mixed design ANOVAs. As the first run of the fMRI task consisted of the same number of trials as the behavioral task, these two tasks were included in the analysis. Furthermore, as the behavioral task also consisted of surprised faces which were not included in the fMRI task, these trials were excluded from the analysis. Means and SD for fixation count, fixation duration and saccade amplitude are presented in see Supplementary Table  . \n\nFor fixation count, a significant main effect of condition [  F  (4.1,159.2) = 3.0,   p   \u2264 0.05] was found with a greater number of fixations made to participants\u2019 own faces and faces depicting anger and fear. A significant main effect was also found for group [  F  (1,39) = 5.3,   p   \u2264 0.05], with AN participants making more fixations than controls. A significant interaction between condition and task was also found [  F  (3.4,131.9) = 7.61,   p   < 0.001] with a decreased number of fixations between implicit and explicit tasks for participants\u2019 own faces and faces depicting fear. There was, however, no significant main effect of task, and no significant interaction between condition and group, or task and group. There was also no interaction between condition, group and task. Analyses conducted on fixation duration revealed a significant main effect of group [  F  (1,38) = 8.5,   p   \u2264 0.01] with AN participants making fixations of shorter duration than heathy individuals. No other significant main effects or interactions were found. Analyses conducted on saccade amplitude resulted in no significant main effects or interactions. \n\nA 2 (group) \u00d7 7 (condition) \u00d7 2 (task) mixed design ANOVA conducted on the FDI revealed a significant main effect of condition [  F  (2.3,82.0) = 16.4,   p   < 0.001], and a significant interaction between condition and task [  F  (4.0,144.9) = 3.0,   p   \u2264 0.05] with greater attention to salient features of one\u2019s own face during the implicit compared to explicit task. Analyses conducted on the FFI revealed significant main effects of condition [  F  (2.2,72.5) = 19.7,   p   < 0.001] and task [  F  (1,33) = 10.1,   p   \u2264 0.01] with greater attention to salient facial features during the explicit task compared to the implicit task. Significant interactions were also found between condition and task [  F  (3.8,125.9) = 3.1,   p   \u2264 0.05] and condition and group [  F  (2.2,72.5) = 3.2,   p   \u2264 0.05]. Within-subjects contrasts did not reveal any significant differences between groups for any emotion, but a significant difference for own faces between AN and control participants [  F  (1,33) = 5.9,   p   \u2264 0.05]. Further 2 (group) \u00d7 2 (task) mixed design ANOVAs were also conducted on the FFI and FDI to participants\u2019 own face. A significant main effect of task, and an interaction between task and group were not found for either the FFI or FDI. A significant main effect of group was, however, found for both the FFI [  F  (1,36) = 7.6,   p   > 0.01] and FDI [  F  (1,36) = 6.8,   p   \u2264 0.05] (see Supplementary Table  ). Control participants showed more visual attention to salient features of their own face, whereas the attention shown to salient and non-salient features of their own face in AN was roughly equal. \n\n\n### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging \n  \n#### Mixed Design Analysis \n  \nThe analysis did not result in a significant group by condition interaction. Simple effects between groups for each condition revealed a significant difference between groups only for the own > neutral face contrast. Increased activation was found in AN compared to controls in the own > neutral contrast in two clusters: one in the right inferior temporal and middle temporal gyri, and one in the right lingual gyrus (  Table   ;   Figure   ). \n  \n Increased activity in the anorexia nervosa (AN) group compared to the control group in the right inferior and middle temporal gyri   (A)  , and the right lingual gyrus   (B)   for participants\u2019 own faces compared to neutral faces (contrast: AN > controls, own > neutral face; FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons at the voxel and cluster levels).   The color scale indicates the   t  -value. \n    \nSignificant activations for participants\u2019 own faces compared to neutral faces between anorexia nervosa (AN) and control participants, Own > Neutral, AN > Healthy Controls. \n    \n\n\n### Pearson\u2019s Correlations \n  \nBOLD activity in the own > neutral face contrast in either the inferior and middle temporal gyri ROI, or the lingual gyrus ROI did not significantly correlate with any eyetracking parameter, rate of emotion identification errors, or the results of the EDE-Q and TAS-20 for either group. Eyetracking and behavioral data, and scores on the EDE-Q and TAS-20 were also not found to correlate with one another. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of this study was to investigate own face processing and the processing of emotional faces of others, in individuals with AN. Although the AN group were found to have higher alexithymia scores, they did not differ from healthy controls in emotion identification of the Ekman emotional face stimuli. Groups were found to differ in visual scanpath behavior to the stimuli in general, with AN participants demonstrating hyperscanning, evinced by increased fixations of shorter duration, relative to controls. AN participants were also found to avoid visually attending to salient features of their own face and displayed increased activity in the right lingual, and inferior and middle temporal gyri to images of their own face, compared to neutral control images, as well as to healthy individuals. \n\nIn analyses directly comparing AN to healthy individuals, AN participants showed increased activity to their own face in the right inferior and middle temporal gyri, and lingual gyrus, areas related to higher-order visual perception. Increased activity of the lingual gyrus has been reported during the processing of human faces ( ), and increased activity in the inferior and middle temporal gyri have been specifically found in response to own face stimuli ( ;  ;  ). Therefore, the findings of the current study suggest an increased processing of own face stimuli in AN in areas related to visual perception of self. \n\nDifferences in lingual gyrus and temporal gyrus activity have also been reported when individuals with AN are presented with images of their own body compared to other individuals\u2019 bodies. However, increased activity in these areas was found for controls relative to AN participants ( ;  ), rather than increased activity in AN as found in the current study. However, neither of those studies actually involved face processing; rather, the faces of the stimuli presented in those studies were masked when presented to participants. Therefore, the differences in activation between the current findings and the findings of these two studies may be related to the specific processing of self-face and self-body images which result in increased activity and decreased activity in these areas in AN respectively. \n\nOur AN group also showed more visual attention to non-salient features and avoided fixating on salient features of their own face.   reported that when AN participants were presented with whole body images of themselves, less visual attention was allocated to their faces compared to controls, though the level of visual attention to different body areas did not differ. Furthermore,   reported a similar pattern of visual attention in a study which presented AN and control participants with food and non-food images simultaneously: although healthy individuals showed more visual attention to food stimuli, the AN group displayed roughly equal attention to food and non-food stimuli. These results may be related to the finding that decreased visual attention is associated with the presentation of anxiety-inducing and phobic stimuli. Similarly to the current findings,   reported that individuals with social anxiety disorder made fixations of short duration to salient features of emotional faces stimuli.  , reported that individuals with spider phobia displayed fewer fixations to spider images and instead diverted their attention to neutral areas of the stimulus. The authors described this behavior as a strategy to cope with threatening and confrontational stimuli, to consequently reduce anxiety. Individuals with AN may utilize similar strategies when viewing their own face as they may find these stimuli anxiety-provoking. An avoidance of salient features was not, however, found to the Ekman face stimuli, suggesting that this behavior is specific to one\u2019s own face. \n\nHyperscanning of face stimuli (increased fixations of shorter duration) was also found in our AN group, though this was not specific to self-face images. Hyperscanning behaviors are associated with increased anxiety, as has been reported in social anxiety disorder to face stimuli of different emotions ( ).   suggested the hyperscanning behavior in social anxiety disorder may reflect a fear of social evaluation. This explanation may also be relevant to the current findings: due to a preoccupation with physical appearance, individuals with AN are particularly sensitive to social evaluations made by others ( ) and may show increased scanning behaviors to related stimuli. \n\nDespite previous reports of emotion identification deficits in individuals with AN, our findings do not concur. Although higher levels of alexithymia were found in the AN group, the ability to identify emotions from a standard set of face stimuli did not differ from healthy individuals. This finding is consistent with the literature which suggests that alexithymia levels are not related to the ability to perceive emotion from faces (see   for a review). However, whether high alexithymia impairs the ability to perceive emotion in an image of one\u2019s own face has not been investigated, nor was it specifically investigated in this study, as we only presented participants with own-face images showing a neutral expression. Although the majority of AN participants reported their own face as portraying a neutral expression, they were more likely than controls to report their own face as depicting a sad expression. However, rather than indicating an emotion identification deficit specific to themselves, this result is more likely to reflect a biased self-perception in how individuals with AN   feel   they look. Thus, when identification errors occurred as they viewed their own faces, they were specific to seeing themselves as sad and not any other emotions. Furthermore, when participants were questioned following the task about their overall experience, the controls often reported that they found it \u2018funny\u2019 looking at their own face, whereas AN patients tended to feel disgusted. \n\nThough AN and control participants differed in the processing of their own face, we found no differences in BOLD activity in response to different emotions, in either group. As strict thresholding was utilized in an attempt to correct for multiple comparisons, the task may not have had sufficient power to document significant differences in activation of each emotion relative to the neutral face condition. However, as the contrasts between participants\u2019 own face and the neutral face condition survived this threshold, the results show that BOLD activity elicited in response to the different emotions was not as strong. Since we were interested in assessing the visual scanpaths of AN patients to face stimuli, the extended presentation time was required for this purpose and the number of trials was therefore limited to remain within a reasonable duration for an MRI task. In future research, where visual scanpaths are not of interest, an increased number of trials should be utilized. It would also be of interest to investigate differences in visual scanpaths and neural activity to both own-face and own-body stimuli in AN, and an evaluation of how these images make AN patients feel. \n\nThe findings of this study have important potential clinical implications. Participants with AN did not differ from healthy control participants in the areas of attentional focus when viewing the Ekman face stimuli, nor did they differ in emotion identification of these stimuli. AN participants did, however, display an avoidance of salient features of images of their own faces. This may have consequently led to the mislabelling of their own neutral expression as sad. In other words, the perception of one\u2019s own face with a neutral expression as appearing sad in AN may be related to patients not looking at the correct areas of their own face when making an affect judgment. This may be as a result of emotional disturbances and alexithymia in AN, or this alternatively may lead to these disturbances. Therefore, remediation techniques which train participants to focus on the correct areas of the face may be beneficial in AN. These techniques have proven useful in other psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, with trained individuals demonstrating an improvement in attention to salient facial features and emotion recognition ( ;  ). Furthermore, the majority of deficits reported in the current study were specific to the processing of self-images in AN. This emphasizes the importance of therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy to address distorted perceptions of oneself in AN and correctly analyzing events and the patient\u2019s own internal dialog. It is also possible that the sense of disgust evoked by viewing their own face also reduced the AN group\u2019s fixations on the salient regions of images of their own faces, in the way that one might avoid eye contact with a repellent individual. \n\nIn summary, this study suggests intact emotion identification of facial affect stimuli and distinct hyperscanning behaviors when viewing faces in AN. Significant differences were also found in the processing of one\u2019s own face in AN, with AN participants showing a greater level of visual attention to non-salient features and increased activity in inferior and middle temporal, and lingual gyri, relative to healthy individuals. These findings suggest overlap with anxiety disorders, as evinced by the hyperscanning behaviors displayed, and increased anxiety, particularly to own face images evinced by an apparent avoidance of salient features. Together with the fMRI finding, the study suggests that the processing of self-face images is different in AN, and may contribute to the distorted perception of oneself experienced by individuals with this illness. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nAP, LA, SR, CG, and DC designed the research; AP completed data collection; all authors were involved in data analysis and manuscript preparation. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nProf. David J.

This prediction error signal concerns the difference between how much reward was predicted and how much reward is gained. However, it remains to be established whether general breaches of expectation, i.e., perceptual prediction errors, are also implemented in the striatum. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the role of caudate nucleus in breaches of expectation. Importantly, breaches were not related to the occurrence or absence of reward. Preceding the fMRI study, participants were trained to produce a sequence of whole-body movements according to auditory cues. In the fMRI session, they watched movies of a dancer producing the same sequences either according to the cue (88%) or not (12%). Caudate nucleus was activated for the prediction-violating movements. This activation was flanked by activity in posterior superior temporal sulcus, the temporo-parietal junction and adjacent angular gyrus, a network that may convey the deviating movement to caudate nucleus, while frontal areas may reflect adaptive adjustments of the current prediction. Alternative interpretations of caudate activity relating either to the saliency of breaches of expectation or to behavioral adaptation could be excluded by two control contrasts. The results foster the notion that neurons in the caudate nucleus code for a breach in expectation, and point toward a distributed network involved in detecting, signaling and adjusting behavior and expectations toward violated prediction. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe striatum was once considered a site of solely motor function, but research over the last three decades has put its cognitive functions more and more into focus (e.g., Alexander et al.,  ; Saint-Cyr,  ; Grahn et al.,  ). One prominent function of the striatum is the coding of a reward prediction error in learning. These prediction errors are triggered by reinforcement or reward in conditioning paradigms (Schultz et al.,  ,  ; Schultz,  ). Reward prediction errors are signified by increases in striatal firing in the presence of unexpected reward or the presence of a reward-predicting cue, or by a decrease of firing when predicted reward is omitted. The underlying notion to a reward prediction error is that the brain is capable of associating the current circumstances with a specific future state (Wolpert and Flanagan,  ; Friston,  ). If the future becomes present and the state is different from what was predicted, this violation of predictions causes a prediction error, which in turn incites learning. \n\nThat the brain is a \u201cpredictive machine\u201d is a feature of many models concerned with learning, action, and perception (Rescorla and Wagner,  ; Schultz and Dickinson,   Kiebel et al.,  ; Bubic et al.,  ; Friston,  ). In an extension of the theory of motor control (Wolpert and Flanagan,  ), the brain's ability to constantly predict ongoing movement, be it in the motor domain or in perception, has been emphasized (Schutz-Bosbach and Prinz,  ). Presence of prediction implies the possibility of computing prediction errors, to adjust internal models according to perceptions and thus shape the correct predictions. The exact anatomic implementation of not reward-related prediction error signals, that code for unexpected perceptions has yet to be revealed (Zacks et al.,  ). The proposed involvement of dopamine (Zacks et al.,  ) and the striatum's extensive connectivity (Alexander et al.,  ; Saint-Cyr,  ) render it a likely candidate as a site of not only reward-related prediction errors but also more general not reward-related prediction errors. \n\nIn fact, there is some evidence that striatal firing-patterns indeed convey prediction errors that are not related to reward. The respective authors likewise used the term prediction error to describe this dorso-striatal activity (Horvitz,  ; Schultz and Dickinson,  ; Graybiel,  ). For the sake of distinction, we will refer to activation that has an amplitude that varies with the amount of (expected) reward as \u201creward prediction errors.\u201d The prediction errors investigated in the current study, that have a positive amplitude to all violated predictions, will be called \u201cbreach of expectation\u201d signals. This breach signal is related to a violated prediction in the simplest sense, i.e., a prediction of any given content is not fulfilled. Accordingly, increased activity toward every unexpected stimulus signifies the breach of expectation signal in dorsal striatum. Indeed, recent imaging studies in humans report caudate nucleus activity for unexpected changes in context, rules, and contingencies (Bunge et al.,  ; Delgado et al.,  ; O'Doherty et al.,  ; Badgaiyan et al.,  ; Koch et al.,  ; den Ouden et al.,  ,  ). These activations can be broadly interpreted as corresponding to the occurrence of unpredicted stimuli. The study of Davidson et al. ( ), for example, revealed a negative response of the caudate to unexpected target omission, which could be reframed as occurrence of a unpredicted target-free stimulus. \n\nTaken collectively, the data suggest that caudate prediction error signals are not restricted to conditioning protocols and that they do not revolve solely around the availability of reward. The empirical evidence implies the presence of breach of expectation signals in caudate nucleus when an event deviates from predictions, but there is a need to probe the assumption directly. \n\nThe lack of studies that target breach of expectation signals is surprising given not only the role they play in current computer models on the matter (Kilner et al.,  ; Kiebel et al.,  ; Friston,  ) but the enormous relevance of correcting false assumptions to prevent possibly fatal future mistakes. The educative effect of breaches of expectation is so strong that it operates even when observing other peoples behavior. Consider the example of seeing someone being bitten by a bulldog after having tread on its paw. If you used to regard bulldogs as aggressive animals, this would not breach your expectations and not incite changes in your views on bulldogs and your behavior toward them. In other words, you wouldn't have learned anything. Now consider watching someone being bitten by a poodle after stepping on its paw. This may be a severe breach of your expectations and teach you to regard poodles more suspiciously in future and adapt your behavior toward them accordingly. This is an example of observational learning, which does not imply direct reinforcement \u2013 it also embellishes two things. The first is the importance of the severity of a breach of expectation to learning. The second is the bonus derived from valid forward models in guiding behavior. \n\nThe current study investigates whether caudate nucleus signals for breaches of expectation in a movement observation paradigm. We hypothesized that watching a dancer make a mistake in a setting of clear-cut cue-movement schedule would yield a caudate response. To keep track of the dancer's performance, participants had to register auditory cues that determined what movement the dancer was to perform next, and watch the ensuing movements. To ensure that all participants were capable of the required prediction, we subdued them to motor training, where they had to accord to the cue-movement schedule themselves. \n\nBreaches of expectation carry two secondary attributes that could each potentially cause striatal activations. Specifically, these events are of an increased saliency and often prompt to modify ongoing behavior. Saliency can be conceived of as a function of stimulus frequency (Zink et al.,  ) and is an attribute carried of not-habituated stimuli (Redgrave and Gurney,  ). As violated predictions were rarely encountered in the present paradigm, i.e., infrequent, they might hence elicit striatal activation due to their saliency (Horvitz,  ; Redgrave and Gurney,  ). Movement switches as opposed to executing one movement repeatedly have also been associated with striatal activity (Roy et al.,  ; Graybiel,  ). Encountering violated predictions in the paradigms is related to having to switch to a new internal movement simulation to keep track of the task. Moreover, as the paradigm included extensive training, there may have been an association of movement errors with initiation of a new movement. Hence, saliency and movement switches had to be investigated separately, to ensure that these attributes of violated predictions could not account for potentially recorded striatal activity. \n\nWe employed an experimental design that allowed to test whether caudate activity actually reflects breaches of expectation (violation hypothesis \u2013 i), or is rather dependent on effects of saliency (saliency hypothesis \u2013 ii) or switching to a different behavior (change hypothesis \u2013 iii). Breaches of expectation were modeled by contrasting predicted with prediction-violating movements. In accordance with the frequency or habituation approach in the literature, we modeled saliency as a function of stimulus frequency in the immediate trial history. Initiation of a new movement was implemented in the movement observation paradigm by contrasting the cues that indicated a new upcoming movement against cues that indicated a movement repetition. \n\nAlthough the present study focused on striatal responses, it was to be expected that they come along with cortical activations, as a prominent characteristic of the neostriatum is its pronounced connectivity with a large number of cortical regions and thalamic nuclei (Alexander et al.,  ; Saint-Cyr,  ). More specifically, activation could be expected in regions related to the processing of biological motion (due to the mismatch between perceived and expected stimulus; Keysers and Perrett,  ) and those related to attentional modulation more generally (due to the explicit instruction rendering breaches of expectation task-relevant; Corbetta and Shulman,  ). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFourteen right-handed, healthy participants (eight women, age 22\u201329, mean age 24.8) took part in the study. Each participant's laterality quotient, as assessed with the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield,  ) was higher than 60. All participants were health screened by a physician and gave informed written consent. \n\n\n### Task-systematic \n  \nThe movement repertoire consisted of five whole-body movements. Each movement consisted of three sub-movements which engaged a characteristic combination of extremities (Figure  ). Each of these movements was assigned an arbitrary name, comprising three syllables, each associated with one corresponding sub-movement (Ko-re-pa; Fe-so-da; Gu-la-mi; Ba-ki-te; Wa-ne-ro). None of these names is meaningful in German; neither were the combinations of the two first or last syllables of each. Importantly, in the course of the experiment, each movement (e.g., Ko-re-pa) could only be followed by one specific other (e.g., Fe-so-da) or by a repetition of itself (e.g., Ko-re-pa). Two piano chords, easily discernible even in absence of former musical training, were used to cue the transition between two movements. Each cue coincided with the onset of one movement and delivered an instruction on which movement was to   follow   the respective movement that had began when the cue sounded. The low chord meant that the transition following the current movement had to be a repetition (i.e., the same movement again; if the movement that started when the cue was presented was for example Ko-re-pa, the low chord meant it had to be followed by another Ko-re-pa). The high chord signaled that the transition following the current movement had to be a switch (i.e., the corresponding next movement; if the concurring movement was Ko-re-pa, the high chord meant it had to be followed by Fe-so-da). Switches were always switches to the next movement in a circular order (Figure  ), no movement was ever skipped. Thus, the upcoming movement was fully predictable, even if it differed from the current movement. \n  \n Movement sequence with depiction of respective sub-movements; the cue presented at each movement onset, determines the transition after completion of respective movement; low tune (red note): repetition of the movement (follows red line); high tune (green note): switch to the next movement (follow the green line)  . Example: (i) a high chord sounds before ko-re-pa (2), indicating that the next movement must be fe-so-da (3 \u2013 a switch must take place); before fe-so-da starts, a low chord sounds (4) indicating that fe-so-da (5) must be followed by fe-so-da (6 repetition). \n  \n\n### Schedule \n  \nThe overall experimental schedule compromised three stages. Participants first had to pass a computer based behavioral experiment (stage 1) to be admitted to training (stage 2). If they completed training successfully, they were allowed to participate in the fMRI experiment (stage 3), which was virtually identical to the initial behavioral probe. The two test sessions and the movement training incorporated the same system of dynamically evolving movement sequences. \n\n\n### Stage 1: behavioral probe session \n  \nIn the computer task, participants watched a dancer performing according to cue, but occasionally making mistakes. Previous to playing the task, the participants were instructed on the cue-movement associations that rule the task (low chord: repetition; high chord: switch). They received a short training where they could choose either four or eight example movies that contained up to 19 cued movements, before they started the task. The movie of the dancer was displayed in the middle of an otherwise gray computer screen, using the Software Presentation 12.0 (Neurobehavioral Systems, San Francisco, CA, USA). Visual input did not extend further than 5\u00b0 of visual angle. The movies were stopped in irregular intervals and participants had to indicate by button press, whether the dancer had performed correctly immediately before video offset. That is, participants had to indicate whether the very last movement had been correct, irrespective of possible earlier errors. Questions were indicated by a question mark (\u201c?\u201d) displayed in font size 24 for 1500\u2009ms or until the first response. Participants had to press the arrow-to-the-left key (index finger) if they judged the last movement to have been according to cue or press the arrow-to-the-right key (middle finger) if they thought the movement had not been according to cue. Responses had to be given within a timeframe of 1500\u2009ms and were followed by a valid feedback for 400\u2009ms indicating correct, incorrect or delayed responses (\u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2212\u201d/\u201c0\u201d; Figure  ). \n  \n Example for two alternative task-developments: Each picture is one movement within a movie, the notes signify high or low chords  . The actress could either perform the last movement before offset correctly (1), meaning the participants would have to judge the performance as correct by index finger button press (\u201cy\u201d). Or the last movement was not according to cue, a breach of expectation (2); the participants would then have to answer by middle-finger button press (\u201cn\u201d) to judge the dancer's behavior as incorrect. Errors\u2019 during the movie where not to be judged upon. Movie offset and thus relevance of the error to the task was not predictable. \n  \nIn both the behavioral and the fMRI session, the task encompassed 400 single movements. Thirty-two movements were not according to cue, i.e., the dancer switched to the next movement when a repetition had been cued (16), or a repetition was performed after a switch had been announced (16). Forty breaks disrupted the movie, which was thus divided into 41 videos of varying duration (3\u201317 movements each). In the behavioral experiment, all 40 breaks were question trials, 20 of them requesting an affirmative answer. \n\nUp to four cues of the same kind, i.e., repetition or switch cues, could appear in a row. At the latest after the fourth identical transition cue (fourth switch or fourth repetition), a dissimilar transition was cued. Across the experiment, four, three, two, and one identical transitions after another appeared equally often. Thus, each cue that was dissimilar from the preceding cues could be differentiated from other first dissimilar cues by the number of preceding transitions that had been identical to each other. For example, a repetition cue could be the first repetition after two switches, or the first repetition after four switches. This randomization was employed to test for the assumptions of the saliency hypothesis (ii). The number of preceding different cues was a measurement of cue saliency against the backdrop of recent cue history. \n\n\n### Stage 2: movement training \n  \nThe participants that passed the 85% criterion of the behavioral experiment subsequently received six 1-h movement-training sessions within 10 days in order to establish a routine-like training stage for the cued performance of movement sequences. Training sessions were conducted in a small dance hall, one side walled with a mirror. During the first session, participants were taught the strict order of the five encompassed movements and learnt accurate performance of the single movements and the associated movement names. To that end, they were allowed to watch a model performing the respective movement on a laptop screen as often as they liked. Once the trainers were satisfied with accuracy of movement performance, participants were verbally instructed to conduct movement sequences, starting each movement when it was called out to them. In their second training session, participants learnt to move according to the cues. They started with a two-cue sequence. For example: Participants were told to start with the movement Ko-re-pa, as soon as the first cue sounded. If the cuing chord was low, they performed Ko-re-pa twice. Importantly they had to start the second Ko-re-pa after the second cue had rung. They had to withhold the third movement corresponding to the second cue, as they would only have been allowed to start the movement upon presentation of a third cue. Once every participant mastered this first step, the number of successive movements (cues) was constantly increased. If one or more participants made a mistake, the sequence had to be started from the beginning. This procedure was implemented in every training session forthwith, at the end of which participants mastered up to 18 cues in a row. Importantly, during training, more than four identical transitions in a row were possible. At the same time, participants had to keep moving at a high level of accuracy and trainers would correct them verbally, and, if necessary, by showing the model-video, over the entire course of training. At the end of the last training session, participants were filmed while performing three 15-cue sequences without further assistance (motor probe). During recording, they wore uniform clothing to allow for unbiased assessment of their performance in a later video evaluation. \n\n\n### Stage 3: fMRI session \n  \nIn the fMRI session that was scheduled for the day after each participant's respective last training session, they encountered the same task as in the behavioral probe. Participants lay supine on the scanner. Their head and arms were stabilized using form-fitting cushioning and their hands rested on a rubber foam tablet. On the right hand side, a response panel was mounted and fixed on the tablet. With their right hand index and middle finger resting on two response buttons, participants were able to judge on the correctness of the dancers movements within the same response contingencies as in the behavioral test. They wore earplugs to attenuate scanner noise and received auditory input via headphones. Participants received visual input on a mirror that was built into the head-coil and adjusted individually to allow for a comfortable view of the entire screen. All parameters were identical to the behavioral experiment (stage 1) with the exception that 24 breaks were used for question trials and 16 for null events (empty trials). \n\n\n### Data acquisition \n  \nA 3T Siemens Magnetom Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) was used in the functional imaging session. In a separate session, prior to the functional MRT, high-resolution 3D T1 weighted whole-brain MDEFT sequences were recorded for every participant (128 slices, field of view 256\u2009mm, 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 pixel matrix, thickness 1\u2009mm, spacing 0.25\u2009mm). The functional session engaged a single-shot gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence sensitive to blood oxygen level dependent contrast (28 slices, parallel to the bicommisural plane, echo time 30\u2009ms, flip angle 90\u00b0; repetition time 2000\u2009ms; interleaved recording). Following the functional session immediately, a set of T1 weighted 2D-FLASH images was acquired for each participant (28 slices, field of view 200\u2009mm, 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128 pixel matrix, thickness 4\u2009mm, spacing 0.6\u2009mm, in-plane resolution 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm). \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nFunctional data were offline motion-corrected using the Siemens motion protocol PACE (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Further processing was conducted with the LIPSIA (Lohmann et al.,  ) software package. Cubic-spline interpolation was used to correct for the temporal offset between the slices acquired in one scan. To remove low-frequency signal changes and baseline drifts, a 1/80\u2009Hz filter was applied. The matching parameters (6 degrees of freedom, 3 rotational, 3 translational) of the T1 weighted 2-D FLASH data onto the individual 3-D MDEFT reference set were used to calculate the transformation matrice for linear registration. These Matrices were subsequently normalized to a standardized Talairach brain size (  x  \u2009=\u2009135,   y  \u2009=\u2009175,   z  \u2009=\u2009120\u2009mm; Talairach and Tournoux,  ) by linear scaling. The normalized transformation matrices were then applied to the functional slices, to transform them using trilinear interpolation and align them with the 3-D reference set in the stereotactic coordinate system. The generated output had thus a spatial resolution of 3\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009mm (27\u2009mm ). \n\nThe statistical evaluation was based on a least-square estimation using the general linear model (GLM) for serially auto-correlated observations. Temporal Gaussian smoothing (4\u2009s FWHM) was applied to deal with temporal autocorrelation and determine the degrees of freedom (Worsley and Friston,  ). All design matrices were generated by hemodynamic modeling using a \u03b3-function. We conducted the analysis once using only one GLM and once more using three GLMs (triple-GLM hereafter), one for each competing contrast. In the single-GLM approach, the three contrasts were set to compete for variance in one GLM to achieve a thorough model comparison. In the triple-GLM approach, the same whole-brain analyses was conducted with three separate GLMs, in order to not underestimate the effects of the competing alternative hypotheses and give them a more liberal chance to yield potential caudate activity. The onset vectors were modeled in a time-locked event-related fashion, i.e., the duration set to one second. The first derivative was taken into the model to improve model fit for latency effects. \n\n\n### Single-GLM approach \n  \nThe events to account for the violation hypothesis (i) were the dancer's incorrect movements, for the other hypotheses (ii and iii) the modeled events were specific cues. Hence, the model encompassed the following event types: correct movements, incorrect movements, first dissimilar transition cues, switch cues, and repetition cues (see below). The model encompassed null events as an additional vector. The violation hypothesis (i) contrasted invalidly cued switches and invalidly cued repetitions vs. validly cued switches and validly cued repetitions. The saliency hypothesis (ii) parametrically modeled the first dissimilar transition cue after 4, 3, 2, or 1 identical transition cue(s), ascribing the highest activation level (vector amplitude) to the dissimilar successor of four cues identical to each other. (The switch cue in Table  , for example would have been assigned a vector amplitude of three; the immediately following repetition cue would have been assigned a vector amplitude of one). In addition, to discern whether potential effects would rely more on a first switch after a number of repetitions or first repetition after a number of switches, we modeled these contrasts in the same fashion of increasing vector values separately, too. That is, in one parametric contrast we ascribed a vector amplitude to each first switch according to the number of previous repetitions (saliency of switches contrast); in the other parametric contrast, the vector amplitude of each first repetition accorded to previous switches (saliency of repetitions contrast). The change hypothesis (iii) was modeled by comparing switch cues to repetition cues. Contrast images, i.e., differences of beta-value estimates for the specified conditions, were generated for each participant. All contrast images were fed into a second-level random effects analysis. The group analysis consisted of one-sample   t  -tests across all contrast images to analyze whether the observed differences between conditions were significantly deviant from 0. Acquired   t  -values were transformed to   z  -scores. To correct for false-positive results, an initial   z  -threshold was set to 2.56 (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, one-tailed, uncorrected for multiple comparisons). In a second step, the results were corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level, using cluster size and cluster value thresholds that were obtained by Monte-Carlo simulations. The employed significance level was   p  \u2009=\u20090.05. Hence, the reported activations are significantly activated at   p  \u2009\u2264\u20090.05, corrected for comparison at cluster level. \n\n\n### Triple-GLM approach \n  \nIn the triple-GLM approach the contrasts (i\u2013iii) were calculated from the same events as described above. However, we employed a different GLM for each contrast that encompassed only the events necessary for the contrast and null-events. The GLM for the violation contrast (i) encompassed validly cued switches, validly cues repetition, invalidly cued switches and invalidly cues repetitions, and null-events. The GLM for the saliency contrast (i) encompassed all first dissimilar cues with a vector amplitude reflecting the number of previous identical repetitions and null-events. The GLM for the change hypothesis encompassed all repetition cues and all switch cues. Group analysis and corrections were identical to the single-GLM analysis described above. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral \n  \nFifteen of 19 volunteers passed the initial behavioral probe at the 85% criterion. All participants completed training and responded correctly to cue \u2013 sequences of up to 18 cues. In the fMRI session, 14 out of 15 participants performed to criterion, with a mean rate of 91.1% correct responses, standard deviation (SD) at 5.4%. Mean rate of correct rejections was 91.7% (SD\u2009=\u20097.3%) and that of hits equaled 90.5% (SD\u2009=\u20097.2%). A two-tailed   t  -test revealed no significant difference between the averages of hits and correct rejections. One participant had to be excluded from further analyses due to insufficient performance (below 2 SDs from mean). \n\n\n\n## fMRI \n  \n### Single-GLM approach \n  \nThe contrast between movements that deviated from cue and movements that accorded to the previous cue (violation hypothesis, i) yielded significant bilateral activations in the basomedial caudate nucleus (Figure  ) and right medial pallidum, in the habenula, the anterior dorsal insula, mesial frontomedian cortex (Brodmann's area [BA] 8 and 9), lateral BA 10, and intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Significant lateralized activations were found in left angular gyrus (AG), right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ; Figure  ; Table  ). \n  \n Single-GLM, violation hypothesis (i) contrast: main effect of movements deviating from cue vs. movements accordig to cue; group averaged activations are shown (at   z  \u2009>\u20093.09) on an axial slice (  z  \u2009=\u200910) of an individual brain, normalized and aligned to the Talairach stereotactic space  . Refer to Table   for activation coordinates. \n    \n Single-GLM, violation hypothesis (i) contrast: main effect of movements deviating from cue vs. movements according to cue; group averaged activations are shown (at   z  \u2009>\u20093.09) on sagittal slices (  x  \u2009=\u2009\u221252; 0; 52) of an individual brain, normalized and aligned to the Talairach stereotactic space  . Refer to Table   for activation coordinates. \n    \n Single-GLM, violation hypothesis (i) contrast: Anatomical specification, Talairach coordinates (  x,y,z  ) and maximal   z  -scores of significantly activated voxels for prediction-violating in contrast to prediction-conform movements  . \n  \nIn the parametric contrasts testing for the saliency hypothesis (ii) only the contrast accounting for activity increase with the number of prior repetitions of identical movements revealed significant activation (saliency of switches contrast). This activity was in supplementary motor area (SMA) and postcentral gyrus. There were no significant correlations with the number of preceding switches. Similarly, there was no significant activation for the general saliency effect, that is number of identical transitions preceding a dissimilar transition, pooled over switches and repetitions. Contrasting switch cues with repetition cues to account for the change hypothesis (iii) yielded the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and bilaterally (anterior) IPS. Notably, there was no significant striatal activation, neither in the parametric contrasts relating to the saliency hypothesis (ii), nor in the contrast relating to change hypothesis (iii; Table  ). \n  \n Single-GLM, change hypothesis (iii) contrast: Anatomical specification, Talairach coordinates (  x,y,z)   and maximal   z  -scores of significantly activated voxels for prediction-violating in contrast to prediction-conform movements  . \n  \n\n### Triple-GLM approach \n  \nThe triple-GLM analysis was employed to calculate the same contrasts as the single-GLM analysis but from three GLMs, optimized for differential effects. This approach yielded caudate activity also only in the violation contrast (i; Table  ; Figure  ). There was no striatal activity either in the saliency (ii) or change contrast (iii). Likewise, cortical activations identified by the violation (i; Table  , Figures   and  ) contrast did not differ largely between the analogous contrasts from the single GLM vs. triple-GLM analyses. The triple-GLM analysis also revealed no significant activity for the saliency (ii) contrast. The parallel change (iii) contrasts from the two analysis approaches revealed quite similar patterns (Tables   and   for comparison). \n  \n Triple-GLM, violation hypothesis (i) contrast: main effect of movements deviating from cue vs. movements according to cue; group averaged activations are shown (at   z  \u2009>\u20093.09) on an axial slice (  z  \u2009=\u200910) of an individual brain, normalized and aligned to the Talairach stereotactic space  . Refer to Table   for activation coordinates. \n    \n Triple-GLM, violation hypothesis (i) contrast: main effect of movements deviating from cue vs. movements according to cue; group averaged activations are shown (at   z  \u2009>\u20093.09) on sagittal slices (  z  \u2009=\u2009\u221252; 0; 52) of an individual brain, normalized and aligned to the Talairach stereotactic space  . Refer to Table   for activation coordinates. \n    \n Triple-GLM, violation hypothesis (i) contrast: Anatomical specification, Talairach coordinates (  x,y,z  ) and maximal   z  -scores of significantly activated voxels for prediction-violating in contrast to prediction-conform movements  . \n    \n Triple-GLM, change hypothesis (iii) contrast: Anatomical specification, Talairach coordinates (  x,y,z  ) and maximal   z  -scores of significantly activated voxels for prediction-violating in contrast to prediction-conform movements  . \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study set out to investigate the role of the caudate nucleus in events that violate predictions (i). In contrast to previous studies, these events were not feedback in an operant conditioning task and involved neither reinforcement nor punishment. Hence, we termed these prediction-violating events \u201cbreaches of expectation\u201d to distinguish them from prediction errors conceived as activity dependent on (future) reception of reward. Moreover, we extended the study-design to exclude the possibility that the striatal activity could be a consequence of potential secondary characteristics of violated predictions, that is responses to salient events (ii) and events that provoke a change in behavior (iii). \n\nThe contrast accounting for the violation hypothesis (i) yielded activation in the basomedial caudate nucleus. On the contrary, striatal activation was absent in the contrasts that accounted for the saliency (ii) or change (iii) hypotheses, even when we calculated these contrasts from separate optimized GLMs in the triple-GLM approach. This pattern of results suggests the dorsal striatum to be tuned to violations of current predictions rather than to these events\u2019 saliency or implied incite to switch behavior. Moreover, the results show that dorso-striatal responses to violated predictions are not restricted to reinforcement or punishment protocols. \n\n### Caudate nucleus signals for breaches of expectation \n  \nThe results of the current study suggest that activity in the head of caudate nucleus signals breaches of expectation, i.e., violated predictions, more generally than previously assumed. This finding may explain why this area is often found in trial and error learning, where its activity diminishes once learning has occurred (Jueptner and Weiller,  ; Delgado et al.,  ; Shohamy et al.,  ; Ruge and Wolfensteller,  ). Trial and error learning means building up predictions what cues demand which action to gain reward. If the predictions fail, actions have to be altered. If the predictions are fulfilled, the deterministics of the task are apparently understood. Accordingly, the diminution of caudate activity over the course of learning is rooted in the fact that only as long as the rules of the task are unknown (at the beginning of learning), predictions are constantly violated, driving caudate activity. Once the rules have been established, breaches of expectation wane and so does caudate activity. The notion that a breach of expectation signal is generated in caudate nucleus could also account for impairments of Parkinson's disease patients in trial and error learning (Shohamy et al.,  ). Their compromised breach of expectation signal, due to neostriatal dysfunction, hinders updating wrong beliefs and accordingly adapting behavior. More evidence for a caudate signal for breaches of expectation comes from studies showing that caudate activity ceases the earlier, the easier it is to learn the association between cues and correct actions, i.e., the easier it is to build up operative predictions (Delgado et al.,  ; Koch et al.,  ). The same activity is persistent for cues that are non-informative, and this is for the same reasons, i.e., that they predict that either of two actions could be correct with the same probability. These cues make it impossible to establish reliable predictions (Delgado et al.,  ). \n\nThe present findings add to these results in an important fashion, showing caudate nucleus involvement for general breaches of expectation, independent of ensuing feedback, in a movement observation paradigm. Breaches of expectation yielded caudate activity, even if the violated prediction was not a prediction on the availability of reinforcement, but only on the next movement that was to be observed. This finding of a \u201cperceptual prediction error\u201d (Zacks et al.,  ) stands in stark contrast to the aforementioned studies that investigated the caudate prediction error signal in relation to feedback on whether the participants had gained or lost money by their last action (Delgado et al.,  ; Koch et al.,  ; Tricomi and Fiez,  ) Moreover, as the breaches of expectation in this study reflect perceptual prediction error, it establishes that this perceptual prediction error has a neural correlate in caudate nucleus. \n\n\n### Cortical areas co-active with caudate nucleus \n  \nWe found a number of cortical areas co-activated for the violation contrast, including the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and the adjacent tempo-parietal junction (TPJ) extending into AG. All three cortical regions are connected to the neostriatum by the fronto-occipital fasciculus as well as by the joint fasciculus subcallosal of Muratoff (Schmahmann and Pandya,  ). This white-matter connectivity points to functionally closely interrelated areas. As the Muratoff bundle directly projects into the dorsal striatum, a fast transmission of perceived deviations to neostriatum is accounted for. Moreover, projections from the AG to caudate nucleus have recently been confirmed by diffusion-tensor imaging in humans (Uddin et al.,  ). \n\nWith regard to this connectivity and these regions\u2019 functions as described in the literature, the concurrent activation for the violation contrast is quite plausible. The pSTS is activated when perceiving biological motion and shows enhanced activation for movements that deviate from expectations (Keysers and Perrett,  ). Adjacent TPJ is involved in predicting the end-state of movements (Arzy et al.,  ) and also in reorienting in space (Blanke et al.,  ; Van Overwalle and Baetens,  ). Accordingly, pSTS enhancement may indicate the dissimilarity between a covert motor plan in our highly trained subjects and the actually perceived (false) movement. TPJ activation, moreover, may result from perceiving limb trajectories toward end-states that differed from the expected (or even covertly prepared) ones. The spreading of activation into AG fosters the idea put forward by other authors that TPJ, extending into AG, actually responds to breaches of expectation (Vossel et al.,  ; Shulman et al.,  ). These authors employed paradigms where a number of cues signaled where a target would appear with different probabilities. Interestingly, when a cue that indicated a high probability of a certain target position was violated, the resulting activation was higher than for the violation of less predictive cues. It therefore seems as if the more surprising an outcome is, that is, the more it violates a current prediction, the higher is the resultant AG activation (Vossel et al.,  ; Shulman et al.,  ). Besides, the aforementioned studies used abstract stimuli, but employed paradigms demanding reorienting in space (Blanke et al.,  ; Vossel et al.,  ; Shulman et al.,  ; Van Overwalle and Baetens,  ). The current study employed solely stimuli that represented human motion, but results agree with the literature that the function of reorienting of attention is related to activity in the temporo-parietal junction and posterior parietal cortex (Corbetta and Shulman,  ). Within this framework, TPJ would be reframed as \u201ccircuit breaker,\u201d which still implies the same function of detecting a salient stimulus that deviates from expectations (Corbetta and Shulman,  ). \n\nIt can be suggested that after transmission of the perceived violation of prediction from the temporo-parietal network to the dorsal striatum, a breach of expectation signal is provided by the dorsal striatum that incites the mediation of frontal responses (Ridderinkhof et al.,  ). The consequential frontal network comprised the mesial frontal cortex bilaterally, specifically Brodmann area 8 (BA), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), anterior dorsal insula and middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Of those, the anterior dorsal insula, ACC and mesial BA 8 have been implicated in situations characterized by uncertainty (Volz et al.,  ; Wager and Feldman,  ; Volz,  ), signifying the likelihood of errors and a need to adapt one's expectations. In the present study, participants expected to encounter events that would deviate from current predictions, but they lacked information regarding the time-point and frequency of such deviating events. Consequently, there was uncertainty toward the ruling probabilistic of the task. \n\nThe involvement of MFG signifies the high impact the task had on working memory (Goldman-Rakic,  ; Braver et al.,  ). The participants had to judge a movement according to an auditory cue that had preceded the currently presented cue. At the same time they had to register the current cue to predict the next movement. This protocol amounts to a one-back-task. Thus, MFG may reflect active retrieval of the last cue in order to judge whether the caudate-conveyed deviation signal was meaningful or not. Engaging working memory in response to a signaled deviation accords to the assumption that in uncertain situations, PFC explores alternatively operating models (Daw et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Subcortical breach of expectation coding \n  \nApart from caudate nucleus, an important subcortical component of the activity in the violation contrast was the habenula. The habenula codes exclusively for negative prediction errors, and thus corresponds in an antagonistic fashion to the classic reward prediction error (Hikosaka et al.,  ). Unexpected positive reinforcement causes a decrease in habenula activity. Meanwhile, during punishment or reward omission the habenula shows an activity increase (Matsumoto and Hikosaka,  ). In contrast, caudate activity has been suggested to be different from both opponents in that it is increased in activity for every breach of expectation, regardless its valence (Horvitz,  ). In the present study, the violations of current predictions did not entail negative consequences. However, making a mistake during behavioral training could well have been ascribed a negative valence. We suggest that as the participants probably engaged in motor imagery to solve the task, exploiting their own memorized experiences during training, seeing the dancer deviating from the protocol was regarded an error with all negative implications (Preston and de Waal,  ; Decety and Jackson,  ; Singer et al.,  ). However, the fact that in this study the signal to violated predictions in caudate nucleus is enhanced at the same time that the habenula codes for a negative prediction error, underpins the breach of expectation nature of caudate activity. We find an activity increase for events that are not predicted in the current forward model, not a typical negative prediction error, as the corresponding habenula activity may suggest (Jocham and Ullsperger,  ). \n\n\n### Predictions, deviations, and learning \n  \nIn the animal literature, prediction errors are mostly described as resultant from the occurrence or omission of reward (Schultz et al.,  ), thereby related to satisfying or averse (external) stimuli. Prediction errors are defined as decreased activity in the face of omitted reward or punishment. However, the current study revealed evidence for heightened caudate activity toward violated predictions in insufficient or failing forward models, and hence breaches of expectation. Establishing predictions and especially signaling for a breach of expectation may be as important as coding how much reward (e.g., food or money) is available, or how unpredicted primary reward was (Spicer et al.,  ). The limitations of fMRI in proving neurotransmitter involvement do not allow drawing the inference that this caudate activity was based in a dopaminergic response (D\u00fczel et al.,  ). The dopaminergic innervation of the dorsal striatum (see Joel and Weiner,   #197 for a review) and the response of the habenula (Jocham and Ullsperger,  ) implicate the dopaminergic system, but further studies are needed to decide whether dopamine is involved in not reward related breaches of expectation. New approaches, especially the free-energy principle (Friston,  ) stress the value of predictive capability   per se  , i.e., the ability to detect breaches of expectation (Kiebel et al.,  ; Suddendorf et al.,  ; Friston,  ). This model regards correct predictions as prerequisite for successful interaction with the environment, because recognizing a situation and acting accordingly is a capability owed to the disposal of valid forward models (Kiebel et al.,  ). The according actions may be to the end of satisfying primary needs or an evolved want. A typical aim in a social interaction would be, e.g., to adhere to the arrangement and to the task instruction in an fMRI study that were formerly mutually agreed upon. Operative forward models themselves can be valuable enough to be perceived as rewarding, even though they do not yield primary reward or reinforcement. Consider, for example, the psychological importance of a sense of control. In learned-helplessness paradigms, where animals are not able to predict and avoid punishment, pseudo-depression is a consequence (Seligman and Maier,  ). Unpredictability is just another facet of non-operative forward-models. To establish operative forward models, breaches of expectation must be registered. If they cease to occur, this can be regarded as evidence that learning, i.e., model adaptation, was sufficient. The sense of accomplishment that goes with feeling in control of a situation provides indeed a powerful motivation to learn. Taken together, breaches of expectation that allow for the generation and improvement of an internal model are of utmost importance to survival, but also psychological wellbeing. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe results of the current study foster the idea that the caudate nucleus signals for occurrence of events that violate the predictions of the operative forward model. This signal is not due to the perception of salient events or the need to change one's behavior, and it is not based on direct reinforcement or punishment. Frontal activation that we observed may be triggered by this signal from the caudate nucleus and operate to deal with present altered environmental demands; either via update of the current forward model or via assessment of the probability of certain event alternatives. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \nThe Movies S1 and S2 for this article can be found online at  \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nLocalization\tTalairach coordinates\tTalairach coordinates\tTalairach coordinates\tz-values, local maxima\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tx\ty\tz\tUnnamed: 4_level_1\nSuperior frontal gyrus (SFG)/pre-SMA (BA 8/6)\t\u22122\t21\t45\t5.8\n\t4\t36\t27\t5.6\nMiddle frontal gyrus (MFG;

Mental imagery of disorder-specific situations proved to be a powerful tool to investigate dysfunctional threat processing in anxiety disorders. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aimed at investigating brain activation in PD patients during disorder-related script-driven imagery. Seventeen PD patients and seventeen healthy controls (HC) were exposed to newly developed disorder-related and neutral narrative scripts while brain activation was measured with fMRI. Participants were encouraged to imagine the narrative scripts as vividly as possible and they rated their script-induced emotional states after the scanning session. PD patients rated disorder-related scripts as more arousing, unpleasant and anxiety-inducing as compared to HC. Patients relative to HC showed elevated activity in the right amygdala and the brainstem as well as decreased activity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, and the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex to disorder-related vs. neutral scripts. The results suggest altered amygdala/ brainstem and prefrontal cortex engagement and point towards the recruitment of brain networks with opposed activation patterns in PD patients during script-driven imagery. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPanic disorder (PD) is a frequent disorder with up to 3.1% 12-month-prevalence  that causes substantial impairment to the individual. Patients suffering from PD are consistently concerned about the occurrence of a panic attack  which is characterised by a sudden outburst of overwhelming fear triggering severe physical reactions . According to cognitive models and behavioural studies, the occurrence of panic attacks is mainly driven by altered threat processing in PD patients . For example, they appear more vigilant to internal bodily sensations , and tend to misinterpret them in a threatening manner . This misinterpretation bias appears to facilitate, among other factors, the initiation of panic attacks and may consequently result in the preservation of high levels of anxiety as well as the maintenance of the disorder . \n\nNeurobiological models suggest that altered threat processing in PD is related to dysfunctions within a brain network comprising the amygdala, the insula, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the hippocampus, and brainstem sites, such as the periaqueductal grey (PAG) region and locus coeruleus . A key role in altered threat processing in PD has been attributed to the amygdala , which is assumed to reflect increased vigilance towards threat . However, the precise function in the pathophysiology of PD remains to be resolved, since findings remain equivocal and altered threat-related amygdala activity has not been consistently reported . A recent meta-analytical work in the functional neuroanatomy of panic disorder condensed findings, revealing abnormal activity predominantly in an extended fear network comprising brainstem, anterior and midcingulate cortex (ACC and MCC), insula, and lateral as well as medial prefrontal cortex, while aberrant amygdala activation seems to more strongly hinge on particular stimuli and experimental paradigms, sample characteristics, as well as on limited neuroimaging methods . \n\nAside the amygdala, altered threat processing in PD patients appears related to aberrant medial PFC and ACC recruitment, with studies showing both increased and decreased activation in response to threat . Aberrant activity in the PFC and the ACC was considered to reflect a deficiency in top-down control of threat responses in PD patients . Furthermore, emerging evidence points towards threat-related functional perturbations within the brainstem and the insula in PD patients . For example, a recent study revealed an association between higher subjective levels of anxiety and brainstem activity as well as increased activity of the insula, interpreted as a token of increased interoceptive processing in PD patients . \n\nTaken together, the neural correlates of altered threat processing in PD remain inconclusive, but ravel around functional perturbations within the amygdala, the PFC, the ACC, the brainstem and the insula. Results and interpretation of functional imaging studies might depend on varying experimental and analytical methods. Further investigations using controlled symptom provocation designs are warranted to gain a comprehensive understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of altered threat processing in PD patients. \n\nA promising tool to explore threat processing mechanisms in patients proved to be the method of script-driven imagery . Participants typically listen to an emotionally laden narrative script and imagine the active role of the protagonist. It has been shown that the emotional and bodily reactions, resulting from threat imagination, are similar to the physiological arousal when facing   in vivo   threat . The method has already been implemented in psychophysiological PD studies and revealed that the imagination of disorder related narrative scripts elicited increase startle, heart rate, and blood pressure responses in PD patients . \n\nBesides psychophysiological responses, recent neuroimaging studies suggest that script-driven imagery involves the recruitment of a fear-related brain circuitry including increased activation of the amygdala, insula, cingulate cortex, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as reduced activation of the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) in anxiety patients . Given the suggested role of these brain regions as described earlier, script-driven imagery might elicit increased vigilance, increased interoceptive processing, and deficient control of responses to threat in PD patients. We therefore hypothesise that aberrant activation particular for mental threat imagery is to be expected in these brain regions during the present experimental procedure. \n\nRemarkably, only one fMRI study has used this method in a pilot study with a highly restricted PD sample (  n  \u2009=\u20096) until today and found threat-related increased activation in cingulate cortex and lateral PFC . Thus, relevant brain imaging studies are lacking that use script-driven imagery as a powerful tool to better understand threat-related brain activation patterns in PD patients during a controlled but symptom provoking experimental situation. \n\nTo pursue this auspicious avenue in research, the aim of the present fMRI study was to explore neural correlates of threat processing in a suited sample of PD patients by means of script-driven imagery based on a newly developed set of controlled disorder-related and neutral scenarios. To this end, we presented the disorder-related and neutral narrative scripts to PD patients and healthy controls (HC) and investigated brain activation in several brain regions, suggested to be relevant for threat processing in PD patients, comprising the PFC, cingulate cortex, amygdala, brainstem, and the insula . We would like to mention that, given the methodological limits of a small sample size, medication and comorbidities of patients as well as the lack of high resolution imaging to characterise brain stem responses, the present study should be looked upon as a pilot study. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Rating data \n  \nMean ratings are provided in Table\u00a0 . Analysis of valence, arousal and anxiety rating data revealed significant main effects of group (valence:   F  \u2009=\u20097.84,   p\u2009=\u2009  0.009;   arousal  :   F  \u2009=\u200935.83,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   anxiety  :   F  \u2009=\u200940.70,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001) and stimulus (valence:   F  \u2009=\u2009185.90,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   arousal  :   F  \u2009=\u2009185.90,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001;   anxiety  :   F  \u2009=\u200987.25,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). Furthermore, there were significant   stimulus   by   group   interaction effects for   anxiety   (F \u2009=\u200922.41, p\u2009<\u20090.001),   arousal   (F \u2009=\u200912.49, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and   valence   (F \u2009=\u20096.34, p\u2009=\u20090.017) (see Fig.\u00a0 ). Disorder-related scripts were generally rated as more arousing, more unpleasant, and more anxiety-inducing than neutral scripts. Patients rated all stimuli as more arousing and anxiety-inducing compared to HC, but neutral stimuli not as more unpleasant (t \u2009=\u2009\u22121.92, p\u2009=\u20090.064). Resolving the interaction effects for valence, arousal, and anxiety ratings revealed that disorder-related scripts were rated as more arousing (t \u2009=\u20095.70, p\u2009<\u20090.001), more unpleasant (t \u2009=\u2009\u22123.22 p\u2009=\u20090.003), and more anxiety-inducing (t \u2009=\u20096.11 p\u2009<\u20090.001) by PD patients compared to HC. Analysis of the   ability to imagine   each script yielded no significant effects (all p\u2009>\u20090.069).   \nMean rating data for disorder-related and neutral scripts on the dimensions of anxiety, arousal, valence, and ability to imagine the scripts. \n  \nNote.

Further inspection of brainstem ROI showed marginally significant hyperactivation in right brainstem to disorder-related vs. neutral scripts for PD patients compared to HC (peak voxel Talairach coordinates x\u2009=\u20093, y\u2009=\u2009\u221220, z\u2009=\u2009\u221218, max. t-value:   t  \u2009=\u20093.00, p\u2009<\u20090.005 uncorrected; cluster size 16\u2009mm ) (Fig.\u00a0 ).

The disorder-related narrative scripts were rated as more arousing, unpleasant, and anxiety-inducing by PD patients as compared to HC. Moreover, PD patients relative to HC showed enhanced amygdala and brainstem activity and decreased activity in dmPFC, dlPFC, vlPFC, vmPFC/rACC and dPCC during imagination of disorder-related vs. neutral narrative scripts. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to reveal enhanced amygdala activity in PD patients during the imagination of disorder-related scripts. Absent differential amygdala activity in PD patients in a former script-driven imagery study might have been due to signal dropouts and very small sample size (n\u2009=\u20096) . In line with our findings, increased amygdala activity was found in PD patients during the processing of fearful facial expressions , symptom provocation , an emotional Stroop task , and processing of disorder-related pictures . Nevertheless, other studies did not reveal threat-related differential amygdala activity in PD patients (for review see ). The amygdala has been suggested to play a role in attentional-vigilance aspects of detecting and processing emotional stimuli in normal and pathological forms of anxiety , and aberrant activity has been associated with hyperarousal towards threat in anxiety disorders . The amygdala also proved to be hyperresponsive to subtle environmental cues, triggering intense physiological threat-related responses in anxiety disorders as well as in healthy subjects . We suggest that designs, in which subjects are strongly trying to control or label their emotions, lead to other brain activation patterns with even reduced amygdala activation (see also ). We infer from these findings that PD patients experienced ongoing, exaggerated vigilance and arousal during the imagination of disorder-related scripts. Furthermore, we would like to note that we do not suggest that the amygdala is necessary for the experience of panic attacks, since such attacks are also possible without amygdala involvement . However, the amygdala might reduce the threshold for elicitation of such attacks due to their functions described above. \n\nApart from increased amygdala activation, we found brainstem hyperactivation in PD patients compared to HC during the imagination of disorder-related scripts. However, these findings have to be interpreted tentatively as brainstem hyperactivation only reached marginal significance (see Table\u00a0 ). Increased activity in brainstem sites is in accordance with a recent study , showing a link between increased activity in the brainstem and the subjective degree of anxiety evoked by threatening pictures in PD patients. Generally, the brainstem appears to be relevant for autonomic body functions, such as cardio-respiratory control, and seems to be associated with different levels of anxiety and anticipation of threat . In PD, brainstem sites, such as the PAG, proved to be hyperactive during a face\u2010word interference task  and in the safe condition of a fear conditioning paradigm . In a \u201ccarbon dioxide hypersensitivity theory of panic\u201d, it was posited that PD patients hold an altered suffocation alarm monitor, leading to a pathological carbon dioxide hypersensitivity that provides the basis for panic attacks . This hypothesis is supported by recent findings, showing that increased brainstem activation and its correlation with the subjective fear of respiratory symptoms might present a neurobiological basis of such a monitoring system . Supporting this, increased activity in the rostral raphe nuclei was demonstrated in response to hypercapnia . In this context, increased brainstem activity in PD patients in the present study may hint at heightened experience of subjective fear of bodily symptoms during threat imagination in PD patients. However, as mentioned before, these conclusions have to be drawn cautiously due to marginal significance of brainstem activation. Questionnaires on the feelings of suffocation, CO2-monitoring as well as a more nuanced analysis of brainstem subnuclei in future investigations may aid in understanding on the role of altered brainstem activity patterns during threat imagination in PD patients.   \nDemographics and questionnaire measures. \n  \nNote. PD, panic disorder patients; HC, healthy controls; M, mean; SD,\u00a0standard deviation; HAM-A, Hamilton Anxiety Rating-Scale : <17: mild anxiety symptoms; STAI-T, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory : >40: pathologically increased level of anxiety; BDI-II, Beck Depression Inventory : >13\u201319: mild depressive. symptoms; ASI, Anxiety Sensitivity Index : 0\u201364, (no standard value); PAS, Panic and Agoraphobia Scale : 19\u201328: moderately severe PD. \n  \n\nPD patients were also marked by reduced vmPFC/rACC activity during disorder-related imagery. Impairment of vmPFC/rACC recruitment appears to relate to dysfunctional modulation of fear responses across anxiety disorders  and has been observed in studies investigating implicit emotion regulation in HC . In fact, the present finding of reduced threat-related vmPFC/rACC activity in PD patients constitutes a common finding across anxiety disorders, since ample evidence revealed reduced vmPFC activity during threat exposure in patient samples . Yet, the former fMRI pilot study on threat-related script-driven imagery in PD patients revealed elevated, instead of reduced ACC activity in PD patients , rendering further investigations necessary. All in all, we assume that reduced activity in the vmPFC/rACC during disorder-related imagination may indicate deficient regulation and modulation of emotional reactivity in PD patients. Out of interest, we conducted a within-group comparison of fMRI data exploring differences between PD patients with and without agoraphobia. This analysis interestingly revealed more pronounced decreased activity of medial prefrontal cortex and rostral anterior cingulate cortex in PD patients with agoraphobia compared to patients without agoraphobia. Given the depicted functions of these brain regions, agoraphobic patients seem even to a higher extend exhibit impaired implicit and explicit emotion suppression and increased focusing when imagining potential threat. This is in line with findings showing that the comorbidity of agoraphobia in patients with panic disorder causes a more severe disturbance compared to PD patients without agoraphobia . \n\nAnother finding of the present study relates to reduced dmPFC activity in PD patients when imagining disorder-related scripts. The dmPFC seems to be involved in the explicit evaluation and appraisal of threat . In PD patients, hypoactive dmPFC activity was found during deliberate reappraisal of negative emotions  and during emotional conflict paradigms . The findings hint at reduced resources of dmPFC recruitment during demanding emotional processing and reappraisal of negative emotions in PD patients. This may eventually lead to high anxiety levels in PD patients. Taken together, we assume that decreased vmPFC/rACC, together with decreased dmPFC activity during disorder-related script-driven imagery, may reflect deficient regulation of emotional reactivity as well as a dysfunctional appraisal and evaluation of threat in PD patients. \n\nMoreover, disorder-related imagery induced decreased activity in the vlPFC as well as in the dlPFC in PD patients relative to HC. Both dlPFC and vlPFC constitute part of a frontoparietal executive network that was shown to mediate intentional, explicit evaluation and regulation of stimuli . Correspondingly, the vlPFC was related to the suppression of emotional processing of negative pictures and the resulting anxiety responses, often with concurrent aberrant amygdala activity in anxiety disorders as well as in healthy subjects . With regard to PD, findings of a study using panic-related words in a go/no-go task showed decreased activity in the vlPFC  that was interpreted to indicate deficient emotion suppression functioning. Reduced vlPFC activation during script-driven imagery may therefore reflect dysfunctional, deliberate modulation of emotional reactivity in PD patients. In a similar vein, the dlPFC is assumed to regulate emotional responding to threat and to prevent excessive emotional expressions . In PD patients, an emotion regulation study showed that patients responded with decreased activation of the dlPFC during the reappraisal of threat, which may hint at emotion regulation deficits . In that respect, the present finding of reduced dlPFC activity during imagination of disorder-related scripts in patients is in accordance with previous findings and hints towards altered modulation of emotional responding in patients. It remains to note that the former fMRI pilot study on script-driven imagery in PD revealed the opposite pattern with elevated instead of reduced dlPFC activity in patients , warranting forthcoming investigations. Altogether, decreased lateral PFC activation in PD might indicate that PD patients may have failed to intentionally dampen their excessive emotional response to the imagination of disorder-related stimuli. \n\nDecreased activity in response to disorder-related scripts was furthermore found in the dPCC in PD patients relative to HC. The PCC has been suggested to play an important role in arousal and directed attention processes . While increased activity of the PCC was observed in resting or passive task states , directed attention on external stimuli seems to be associated with decreased PCC activity in HC . Particularly the dorsal part of the PCC appears to be involved in detecting external stimuli that might demand a behavioural response to change situational conditions . Correspondingly, decreased activity of the dPCC was observed in HC in tasks when a narrow focus on external stimuli was needed . Since PD patients show a decrease in dPCC activity during disorder-related imagery, we thus speculate that patients fostered more focused attention to disorder-related scripts as compared to HC. \n\nInterestingly, several regions found to be hypoactivated in the present study (i.e., mPFC, rACC, and dPCC) closely correspond to the so-called default mode network (DMN) . The DMN is a neural network system that mediates levels of cognitive activity, showing lower activity during specific goal-directed behaviours . It has been suggested that, as a result of direct competition with other systems, focused attention on external stimuli is inclined to attenuate activity in the DMN . These findings lend preliminary support for the interpretation that the observed brain response pattern of the present investigation may reflect a stronger attentional focus on disorder-related scripts in patients relative to HC. \n\nScript-driven imagery has predominantly been used in anxiety patients in order to research fear-related threat responses . Therefore, it proves to be difficult to ascribe certain neural activation patterns to the paradigm itself. Activation patterns elicited by the paradigm may overlap disorder-specific activation patterns and similarities cannot be completely ruled out. Thus, results have to be carefully interpreted when it comes to draft a model of neural correlates specifically being involved during script-driven imagery. As mentioned before, script-driven imagery hitherto involved aberrant brain activation in the amygdala, insula, cingulate cortex, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as reduced activation of the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC). Our findings corroborate that script-driven imagery of threat triggers neural emotional reactivity in these structures, although not all of the suggested structures showed aberrant activation. We propose therefore, particularly given the characteristics of the paradigm with regard to its potential impact on the DMN, that during script-driven imagery PD patients seem more vigilant towards possible threat, which might be mediated by the amygdala since it has been involved in the modulation of attention . Attenuated activity in structures of the DMN possibly does not only mean a higher attentional focus on threat, but also a more intense struggle to contain control of threat responses, potentially mediated by the known function of the vmPFC to inhibit amygdala activation . \n\nContrary to our hypotheses, the present study did not detect increased insula activation to disorder-related imagery in PD patients. This finding is surprising, since the insula is linked to interoceptive processing  and PD patients are marked by overly sensitive attention towards interoceptive sensations . In PD, hyperactivated insula was recently observed in several studies investigating emotional processing . Therefore, we expected processing of disorder-related stimuli to evoke elevated insula activity in PD patients. Interestingly, the previous pilot fMRI study on disorder-related imagination in PD patients also did not reveal differential insula activity in PD patients relative to HC . One reason for these findings might be that differential insula effects in PD patients as compared to HC are stronger in response to single highly salient threat-related stimuli  and during specific emotional tasks  as compared to a continuous script based symptom provocation as used in the present study. Forthcoming investigations are hence required to clarify the role of the insula during altered threat processing in PD depending on specific designs and task conditions. \n\nAltogether, the findings of the current investigation may reflect that two opposed brain activation patterns were engaged in PD patients when exposed to disorder-related scripts: a hyperactivated pattern including the amygdala and the brainstem as well as a hypoactivated pattern including prefrontal and cingulate cortex regions. The hyperactivated amygdala-brainstem pattern may point towards hyperarousal, a hypersensitive response to potential threat, and a subsequent higher subjective level of anxiety in PD patients. The hypoactivated prefrontal/cingulate cortex pattern may reflect deficient implicit and explicit emotion suppression and increased focusing when imagining potential threat in PD patients. \n\nWe would like to mention some limitations of the present study. Although the sample size is an improvement compared to the previously published imagery fMRI study in PD , a total sample size of 34 subjects (17 HC vs. 17 PD does still not admit a generalisation of the study results. Larger sample sizes would undoubtedly be beneficial not only to relate findings to interindividual differences, but also to investigate small or absent effects, such as the current brainstem effect, in more detail. Moreover, larger samples allow conducting whole-brain rather than ROI analysis, which provides stronger evidence of neural correlates of PD pathophysiology. However, several recent fMRI studies using imagery as a paradigm had comparable sample sizes . \n\nWe also agree that medication intake poses a threat to the interpretation of study results. Thus, we exploratively excluded medicated patients from fMRI analysis, indicating that there was no confounding effect of medication intake on the present results. This finding is in line with a recent review, stating that the influence of psychotropic medication on neuroimaging findings either showed no influence, or a normalising influence . \n\nFurthermore, the present PD patient sample had comorbidities. Comorbidities represent a possible interference factor for the interpretation of the results. Patients were therefore diagnosed by an experienced clinical psychologist to ensure that PD was the principle diagnosis for all patients. Moreover, PD patients frequently show a high prevalence of comorbidities  so that including comorbid patients might even enhance external validity. However, it would be beneficial to investigate samples of patients free of comorbidities. Finally, future studies would profit from direct comparisons between different kinds of symptom provocation designs in order to better understand the reasons between discrepancies between different studies/designs. \n\nConcerning brainstem findings, we have to mention that we did not use high resolution imaging and specialised imaging protocols to better characterize the brain stem response, so that results have to be interpreted with some reservations. \n\nTo conclude, disorder-related relative to neutral scripts elicited increased amygdala and brainstem activity as well as decreased activity in bilateral PFC, the ACC, and the dPCC in PD patients relative to HC. Apparently, two opposed activation patterns were engaged in PD patients when exposed to threat: Firstly, imagining disorder-related scripts led to increased amygdala activity in PD patients, which might correspond to an enhanced arousal and abnormal vigilance towards threat. Elevated brainstem activation might further signify an increased awareness of bodily symptoms and a corresponding heightened subjective anxiety level during imagery of disorder-related scripts. Secondly, decreased activity in the PFC and cingulate cortex might reflect an increased attentional direction to threat and coincident deficient emotional regulation of threat. Altogether, both activation patterns might represent the neural correlates of altered threat processing during the imagination of disorder-related stimuli in PD patients. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThe sample consisted of 17 PD patients (male   n  \u2009=\u20092) and 17 HC (male   n  \u2009=\u20094), matched for age, gender and years of education (Table\u00a0 ). All participants were right-handed and native German speakers. Participants were recruited through public advertisements and at an outpatient clinic. Patients met criteria for PD as the main diagnosis by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (German version of the SCID) . Furthermore, the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) was used to confirm the diagnosis of PD . This scale was used because we included PD patients with (  n  \u2009=\u200910) and without (  n  \u2009=\u20097) agoraphobia and this scale is characterised by high external validity (Pearson correlation coefficient   r  \u2009=\u20090.79,   p  \u2009<\u20090.0001 with psychiatrists\u2019 clinical global impression of severity) and reliability (Cronbach\u2019s   a   coefficient of 0.88; for further psychometric data see ). Exclusion criteria comprised neurological disorders, traumatic brain injury, psychotic or bipolar disorder, and drug abuse or dependence within the past ten years (for further sample characteristics, see Table\u00a0 ). Comorbidities among PD patients comprised major depressive disorder (n\u2009=\u20092), somatization disorder (n\u2009=\u20092), dysthymia (n\u2009=\u20091), specific phobia (n\u2009=\u20091), generalised anxiety disorder (n\u2009=\u20092), bulimia nervosa (n\u2009=\u20091), obsessive-compulsive disorder (n\u2009=\u20091), and social anxiety disorder (n\u2009=\u20091). The final sample included three patients taking antidepressant medication. Informed consent has been obtained of all participants prior the experiment and the study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Medical Chamber Westphalia-Lippe and the faculty of medicine of the Westphalian Wilhelms-University of Muenster (Ethikkommission der \u00c4rztekammer Westfalen-Lippe und der Medizinischen Fakult\u00e4t der Westf\u00e4lischen Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster). All experimental methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. \n\n\n### Stimuli \n  \nStimulus material was composed of standardised disorder-related (n\u2009=\u20095) and neutral (n\u2009=\u20095) scripts. All scripts lasted exactly 30\u2009seconds. They were recorded in third person present tense. Based on the bio-informational theory , our scripts included sensory representations (i.e. stimuli conceived in the context), information about the context of the situation (who, where, what) and representations of behavioural and physiological response to the context . The disorder-related scripts depicted panic-related situations (e.g. standing on a crowded platform, entering a narrow elevator) and involved suggestive descriptions of autonomic reactions (e.g. sweaty palms, palpitations). Neutral scripts described various everyday life situations (e.g. watching TV at home, reading a newspaper) and sensory information (e.g. warm water, chilly air). Scripts were tape-recorded and read out by a female voice in a neutral tone blind to the hypotheses of the study. \n\n\n### Experimental procedure \n  \nOutside the scanner, participants received standardised instructions and listened to two neutral scripts via headphones during practice trials. The practice scripts were not presented during the actual experiment. Participants were encouraged to imagine the sceneries as detailed and multi-sensory as possible. If they were able to vividly imagine the scripts on the practice trials, the scanning procedure was started. In the scanner, participants were informed about the procedure by written instructions on a black screen and after practice trials via headphones. They were instructed to close their eyes during the imagination. A beep signal indicated the beginning and the end of each auditory script (400\u2009Hz, 500\u2009ms). The trials were pseudo-randomised with an inter-trial interval of 20\u2009s. The participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed and to concentrate on the surrounding sounds of the scanner during the inter-trial interval. The task lasted for approximately 9\u2009minutes. Upon finishing, participants had to evaluate the scripts on a 9-point Likert scale  with regard to anxiety (1\u2009=\u2009not anxiety-inducing, 9\u2009=\u2009most anxiety-inducing), arousal (1\u2009=\u2009not arousing, 9\u2009=\u2009most arousing) and valence (1\u2009=\u2009most unpleasant, 5\u2009=\u2009neutral, 9\u2009=\u2009very pleasant). Additionally, they rated their ability to imagine each script (ability to imagine the scripts, measured in %) (Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n### Analysis of sociodemographic, clinical questionnaire and rating data \n  \nSociodemographic, clinical questionnaire, and rating data were analysed using IBM SPSS software (v22, Armonk, New York, USA). Rating data were analysed using a mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) separately for anxiety, valence, arousal, and ability to imagine the scripts to explore within- and between-subject contrasts. A probability level of   p  \u2009\u2264\u20090.05 was considered as statistically significant. To resolve interaction effects, Bonferroni-corrected t-tests were implemented (corrected significance level p\u2009\u2264\u20090.008). \n\n\n### FMRI acquisition and analysis \n  \nData were collected using a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance scanner (\u201cMagnetom Prisma\u201d, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Before the start of the experiment, anatomical recordings of each participant were made, applying a sagittal high-resolution T1-weighted sequence with 192 slices. Functional data were collected using a T2*-weighted echo-planar sequence and comprised 260 volumes (TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms, TR\u2009=\u20092080\u2009ms, matrix\u2009=\u200992\u2009\u00d7\u200992 voxels, field of view 208 mm , flip angle 90\u00b0). Each volume consisted of 36 axial slices (thickness 3.0\u2009mm, 0.3\u2009mm gap, in plane resolution\u2009=\u20092.26\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20092.26\u2009mm). The functional data were analysed using Brain Voyager QX (Version 2.8; Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). The first four volumes were discarded to warrant adequate steady-state tissue magnetization. The recordings were then corrected for slice time errors and motion deviation using trilinear interpolation. \n\nAfterwards, anatomical and functional images were co-registered to fit Talairach space  and smoothed spatially (6\u2009mm full-width half-maximum [FWHM] Gaussian kernel) and temporally (high-pass filter: 10 cycles per run, low-pass filter 2.8\u2009s; linear trend removal). The voxel-size was resampled to 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm for further statistical examination. Statistical analysis of   blood oxygenation level dependent (  BOLD) data consisted of multistage linear regression of the signal time course of each voxel. The signal change of each voxel in respect of the different predictors (disorder-related and neutral scripts) was modelled by a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) using a general linear model (GLM). Predictors of interest were the disorder-related and neutral scripts. Introducing and concluding sounds as well as the six motion parameters were considered as predictors of no interest. Z-standardised predictor estimates for the voxel-time-course were determined for each participant employing a random-effects model with adjustment for autocorrelation. Further analyses of the originated voxel-wise statistical maps were small-volume corrected for anatomically defined regions of interest (ROIs), including amygdala, insula, cingulate cortex and PFC. Based on the Automated Anatomical Labeling Atlas (AAL) , ROIs were defined and transformed into Talairach space applying ICBM2tal . For the brainstem, the ROI was downloaded from the digitised version of the Talairach atlas ( ). \n\nThe ROI based voxel-level threshold was set to   p  \u2009<\u20090.005 to balance between Type I and II error rates (see also ), considering the realistic effect sizes in studies with patients . The thresholded maps were submitted to an ROI-based correction criterion for multiple comparisons based on the estimate of the maps spatial smoothness and on an iterative procedure (Monte Carlo simulation as implemented in BrainVoyager), which do not use the Gaussian random-field approach for cluster-size thresholding. It estimated the minimum cluster-size using 10000 iterations, ensuring a false cluster-level-significance to be p\u2009<\u20090.05. Due to small brainstem subnuclei, no cluster threshold was used for brainstem activation . Based on preceding neuroimaging studies in PD using both whole-brain  and ROI analyses , we restricted our analyses to homogeneous search spaces guided by a hypothesis-driven ROI approach. This contributes to avoid possible inflation of false-positive clusters in parametric analyses due to inhomogeneity of spatial smoothness and spatial autocorrelations across the whole brain with resulting hot spots of false positive clusters .

However, it remains unclear whether disrupted asymmetry originates from inter-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC) and/or intra-hemispheric FC in this patient population. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nForty-four patients with drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia, 42 unaffected siblings, and 44 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. The parameter of asymmetry (PAS) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to analyze the data. Patients were treated with olanzapine for 8\u202fweeks. \n\n\n## Findings \n  \nCompared with healthy controls, patients showed lower PAS scores in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG)/inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus and left angular gyrus, and higher PAS scores in the left precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus. Unaffected siblings also showed lower PAS scores in the left MTG/ITG and left PCC/precuneus relative to healthy controls. Further, SVM analysis showed that a combination of the PAS scores in these two clusters in patients at baseline was able to predict clinical response after 8\u202fweeks of olanzapine treatment with 77.27% sensitivity, 72.73% specificity, and 75.00% accuracy. \n\n\n## Interpretation \n  \nThe present study suggests disrupted asymmetry of inter- and intra-hemispheric FC in drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia; in addition, a reduced asymmetry of inter-hemispheric FC in the left MTG/ITG and left PCC/precuneus may serve as an endophenotype for schizophrenia, and may have clinical utility to predict response to olanzapine treatment. \n\n\n## Fund \n  \nThe National Key R&D Program of China and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n   Research in context   \n## Evidence before this study \n  \nWe searched PubMed from the start of the database until June 24, 2018, for functional asymmetry of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in patients with schizophrenia, with the search terms \u201cschizophrenia\u201d, \u201cfunctional asymmetry\u201d, and \u201cfunctional connectivity [Title]\u201d, and \u201cEnglish\u201d [Language]. We found three published articles before we initiated the study. In these studies, rsFC strength and independent component analysis (ICA) were used to measure the brain lateralization. Human brain demonstrates inter- and intra-hemispheric interactions in response to a stimulus. Therefore, the brain lateralization may be measured by inter- and intra-hemispheric FCs. It still remains unknown to what extent inter- and/or intra-hemispheric FC contribute to disrupted asymmetry in the brain in patients with schizophrenia. \n\n\n## Added value of this study \n  \nForty-four patients with drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia, 42 unaffected siblings, and 44 healthy controls were enrolled in the present study. A quantitative parameter of asymmetry (PAS) was calculated to reflect inter- and/or intra-hemispheric asymmetry. Our study demonstrated disrupted asymmetry in patients with drug naive, first episode schizophrenia and unaffected siblings, which are preferentially within the left hemisphere. A reduced asymmetry of inter-hemispheric FC in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG)/inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus may serve as an endophenotype for schizophrenia, and may have clinical utility to predict response to olanzapine treatment. \n\n\n## Implications of all the available evidence \n  \nFirst, left-sided abnormal functional asymmetry in the brain in drug naive, first episode schizophrenia and unaffected siblings demonstrates that schizophrenia is a brain disorder. Second, reduced inter-hemispheric FC in the default mode network (DMN) may bear genetic load and serve as an endophenotype for schizophrenia, confirming that schizophrenia is a genetic disorder. Finally, biomarkers to reflect disrupted functional asymmetry in the brain, such as a combination of the PAS scores of the left MTG/ITG and left PCC/precuneus, may have great clinical implications to help clinicians make individualized treatment decisions for patients. \n\n \n\n## Introduction \n  \nFunctional asymmetry of inter- and intra-hemispheric interaction exists during the normal development of human brain. For example, the left hemisphere is more specialized for high spatial frequencies; whereas the right hemisphere prefers to process low spatial frequencies [ ]. The right hemisphere is also biased towards processing line bisection [ ], line orientation [ ], and mental rotation [ ] compared to the left hemisphere. The two hemispheres interact with each other via callosal fibers [ ]. Healthy individuals benefit from such inter-hemispheric interaction. Having both hemispheres involved in processing tasks is more advantageous than just one hemisphere, especially when computational complexity increases [ , ]. Further, it has been reported that asymmetry in intra-hemispheric connectivity is associated with language hemispheric dominance [ ]. \n\nEven though healthy individuals benefit from normal asymmetry of inter- and intra-hemispheric interactions for efficient information processing, such asymmetry is disrupted in schizophrenia. Non-right-handed individuals are apt to suffer from schizophrenia than right-handedness [ ], which may suggest a failure to develop brain asymmetry. Crow et al. [ ] has reported that structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities are highly significantly selective to the left hemisphere in schizophrenia. Our group has found reduced gray matter volume in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), but not in the right MTG, in patients with drug naive, first episode schizophrenia and their unaffected siblings [ , ]. Disruption of normal asymmetry in white matter tracts also has been reported in patients with chronic schizophrenia [ ]. In addition, reduced inter-hemispheric connectivity in patients with schizophrenia has been reported by our group and others [ , ]. \n\nSeveral important questions are still to be answered with regard to disrupted asymmetry in the brain in patients with schizophrenia. First, resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) strength and independent component analysis (ICA) were used to measure the brain lateralization in previous studies. Human brain demonstrates inter- and intra-hemispheric interactions in response to a stimulus. Therefore, the brain lateralization may be measured by inter- and intra-hemispheric FCs. It still remains unknown to what extent inter- and/or intra-hemispheric FC contributes to disrupted asymmetry in the brain in patients with schizophrenia. Second, it is unclear whether such disrupted asymmetry represents an endophenotype for schizophrenia. An endophenotype is state independent and heritable, and segregates with known illness loci [ ]. Endophenotype is often observed in unaffected siblings at an increased rate than in the general population [ , ]. Third, existing evidence suggests that antipsychotic drugs can alter rsFC patterns [ ,  ,  ,  ]; in addition, changes induced by antipsychotic drugs in brain network topology can predict individual treatment response [ ]. However, it is still unknown whether disrupted asymmetry in the brain is associated with clinical response to antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia. \n\nThe present study sought to address these questions. Patients with drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia, unaffected siblings and healthy controls were recruited in the study. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was used to assess voxel-wise inter- and intra-hemispheric FCs. Inter- and intra-hemispheric FCs were calculated between a given voxel and other voxels from the opposite hemisphere (inter-hemispheric FCs) and the same hemisphere (intra-hemispheric FCs). Then, a quantitative parameter of asymmetry (PAS) was calculated to reflect inter- and/or intra-hemispheric asymmetry (PAS\u202f=\u202fFC \u202f\u2212\u202fFC ). This voxel-wise method does not depend on pre-defined regions of interest (ROIs) in two hemispheres, therefore minimizing potential confounding effects of structural asymmetry and selection bias caused by ROIs. Previously, autonomy index (AI), an asymmetry parameter, was calculated by counting the numbers of voxels with abnormal functional asymmetry [ ]. AI is valuable to quantify functional asymmetry. However, AI ignores the correlation coefficient of each voxel, which is an important characteristic of functional asymmetry. Therefore, we proposed a novel method, PAS, to quantify correlation coefficients of voxels with functional asymmetry in the present study. Unaffected siblings were recruited to examine whether disrupted asymmetry represent an endophenotype for schizophrenia. Patients received olanzapine treatment for 8\u202fweeks. Previous univariate analysis could predict clinical response at the group level [ ], which was of little utility to guide treatment decision making for individual patients in the clinical setting. By contrast, pattern classification techniques including support vector machine (SVM) allow prediction at the individual level, which might be helpful in the clinical setting. Such methods have been used to differentiate patients with adolescent-onset schizophrenia and healthy controls [ ], and to predict clinical response to electroconvulsive treatment in patients with major depressive disorder [ ]. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether the baseline PAS scores can predict individual clinical response to olanzapine treatment at week 8 using the SVM method. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nForty-six patients with drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia and 46 unaffected siblings were recruited from the Mental Health Center, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University in China between June 2013 and July 2014; 46 healthy controls were recruited from the local community during the same time period. All subjects were in the age range 18\u201337\u202fyears old and right handed, and had >6\u202fyears of formal education. \n\nPatients were diagnosed with schizophrenia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV). They were never treated with antipsychotic medications or other psychotropic agents. The diagnosis of schizophrenia was further determined by two research psychiatrists (W.G. and Z.Z.) using the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), patient version [ ]. All patients had a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score of >70 at baseline. Exclusion criteria included history of nicotine dependence, alcohol or other substance dependence, or history of brain injury. A routine physical examination including review of systems, and routine laboratory tests including complete blood cell count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function test, urinalysis, electrocardiography, and chest radiography were performed to exclude any ongoing significant medical conditions. \n\nUnaffected siblings and healthy controls were recruited through advertisement. They went through the same physical examination and routine laboratory tests to rule out any medical conditions. In addition, the same research psychiatrists (W.G. and Z.Z.) conducted a structured clinical interview using the SCID, non-patient version [ ] to rule out any psychiatric conditions. None of them had a history of any psychiatric conditions, nicotine dependence, alcohol or other substance dependence. In addition, those who had a first-degree relative diagnosed with psychiatric disorders were not eligible to be healthy controls. \n\nPatients were treated with olanzapine (10\u201330\u202fmg/d with a mean (standard deviation) dose of 18.30 (5.17) mg/d) for 8\u202fweeks. The PANSS was repeated at week 8. \n\nThe study was approved by the ethics committees of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University. All subjects signed a written informed consent. \n\n\n### Image acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nImages were obtained using a 3\u202fT MRI scanner (Siemens Verio, Erlangen, Germany). The images were analyzed using the DPABI software [ ]. More details about image acquisition and pre-processing can be found in the Supplementary files. \n\n\n### Calculation of the PAS scores \n  \nFor each subject, correlation coefficients were calculated between a given voxel and other voxels from the same hemisphere (intra-hemispheric coefficients) or other voxels from the opposite hemisphere (inter-hemispheric coefficients) by using a voxel-wise whole-brain analysis. The mean coefficient of this given voxel was termed as the intra-hemispheric FC or inter-hemispheric FC of this voxel. Because small correlation coefficients between voxels, which were not significantly greater/smaller than zero, might bring in confounding effect on asymmetry analysis, the PAS calculation was conducted based on a pre-defined correlation coefficient threshold (  r  \u202f>\u202f0.2) in order to remove weak correlations likely due to signal noise [ , ]. To test whether the choice of correlation coefficient threshold might affect the findings, another correlation coefficient threshold (  r  \u202f>\u202f0.25) was also used according to a previous study [ ]. Given the detrimental effects of negative correlations on test\u2013retest reliability [ ] and ambiguous explanation of negative correlations [ ,  ,  ], the PAS calculation was restricted to positive correlations only. The mean coefficients were   z   transformed as described previously [ ]. The PAS values were calculated using the formula below: \n\nFC  refers to inter-hemispheric FC, and FC  intra-hemispheric FC. A positive PAS score means that the asymmetry mainly originates from inter-hemispheric FC, whereas a negative PAS score means that the asymmetry primarily results from intra-hemispheric FC. Based on calculated PAS scores, the PAS maps were generated for further analysis. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nDemographic and clinical data were analyzed using Chi-square test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) as appropriate. \n\nFramewise displacement (FD) was calculated for each subject using the method described previously [ ]. For the PAS maps, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), followed by post hoc   t-  tests, was used to compare group differences controlling for the mean FD and age. The significance level was set at   p  \u202f<\u202f0.05 corrected by the Gaussian random field (GRF) theory (voxel significance:   p  \u202f<\u202f0.001, cluster significance:   p  \u202f<\u202f0.05) using the REST software [ ]. \n\nOnce abnormal clusters were identified by group comparisons, the mean PAS scores were extracted from every cluster in the patient group. Normality test was conducted to confirm that the data for mean PAS scores and clinical variables are in normal distribution. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed within patients to examine the relationship between the mean PAS scores and clinical variables including illness duration and the PANSS total scores. The significance level was set at   p  \u202f<\u202f0.05 after the Bonferroni correction. \n\n\n### SVM analysis \n  \nSVM was performed using the LIBSVM software ( ). Patients were divided into two groups (good response versus poor response) based on the median value of the reduction ratio (RR) of the PANSS total scores after 8\u202fweeks of olanzapine treatment. The median value was used to ensure equal numbers of patients between the two groups, which is required for SVM analysis. The RR was calculated as follows. \n\nPANSS  refers to the PANSS total scores at baseline, whereas PANSS  is the PANSS total scores after 8\u202fweeks of treatment. \n\nSVM was used to examine whether the PAS scores at baseline can predict clinical response to olanzapine treatment at week 8. A \u201cleave-one-out\u201d procedure was applied to perform SVM. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Characteristics of the subjects \n  \nThe data of 8 subjects (2 patients, 4 siblings, and 2 controls) were discarded due to excessive head motion. Therefore, 44 patients, 42 unaffected siblings, and 44 healthy controls were finally enrolled. There were no significant differences in age, gender, education level, and the mean FD across groups (eTable 1). Within patients, the PANSS scores were significantly decreased after 8\u202fweeks of treatment (eTable 2). \n\nAs shown in eTable 4, there were no significant differences between the good response group and the poor response group in important demographic and clinical characteristics including age, gender, education level, illness duration, and dosage of olanzapine (  p  's\u202f>\u202f0.05). \n\n\n### Group differences in the PAS scores \n  \nSpatial maps of the PAS scores for each group were presented in eFig. 1. Increased PAS scores were observed in the lateral prefrontal, lateral parietal, temporal gyri, whereas decreased PAS scores were found in the visual and sensorimotor regions within patients; our results are consistent with the findings from a previous study on hemispheric specialization in schizophrenia [ ]. Moreover, the two hemispheres exhibited different patterns of PAS scores in healthy controls, consistent with the findings from a previous study in 1000 healthy controls [ ]. \n\nAs shown in eFig. 2, the three groups (patients, unaffected siblings and healthy controls) differed in the PAS scores in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices. \n\nCompared with healthy controls, patients at baseline had significantly lower PAS scores in the left MTG/inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus and left angular gyrus, and significantly higher PAS scores in the left precentral grus/postcentral gyrus (  and  ). Unaffected siblings showed significantly lower PAS scores in the left MTG/ITG and left PCC/precuneus relative to healthy controls (  and  ). Both patients and unaffected siblings showed lower PAS scores in the left MTG/ITG andleft PCC/precuneus.   \nPost hoc   t-  tests across groups.

Compared with the poor response group, the good response group showed decreased PAS scores in the left superior parietal lobule and increased PAS scores in the right precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus (eTable 5 and eFig. 4). When the mean RR was used as the cut-off value, similar results were obtained using a whole-brain voxel-wise statistical comparison of the PAS scores between the good response group (25 patients) and the poor response group (19 patients) (eTable 5). \n\n\n### Correlation analysis results \n  \nWithin patients, no correlations were found between the PAS scores and the PANSS total scores or the illness duration at baseline. \n\n\n### SVM analysis results \n  \nBased on the median of the RR of the PANSS total scores (0.580), patients were divided into two groups (good response versus poor response, 22 patients in each group). Because univariate analysis showed that both patients and unaffected siblings had reduced PAS scores in the left MTG/ITG and left PCC/precuneus. SVM analysis was performed using the baseline PAS scores in these two clusters: the left MTG/ITG and left PCC/precuneus. The results showed that the PAS scores from single cluster were not able to predict patients with good response versus those with poor response after 8\u202fweeks of olanzapine treatment. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 72.73%, 54.55%, and 63.64% respectively in the left MTG/ITG, and 63.64%, 77.27%, and 70.45% respectively in the left PCC/precuneus. However, a combination of the PAS scores of these two clusters was able to predict clinical response to olanzapine treatment with 77.27% sensitivity, 72.73% specificity, and 75.00% accuracy ( ).   \nSVM analysis using a combination of the PAS scores in the left MTG/ITG and left PCC/precuneus.

We found that disrupted asymmetry in schizophrenia is preferentially within the left hemisphere as reflected by reduced inter-hemispheric FC in brain regions of the default-mode network (DMN, including the left MTG/ITG,left PCC/precuneus, and left angular gyrus) and elevated inter-hemispheric FC in the sensorimotor region (including the left precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus). Patients and unaffected siblings shared reduced inter-hemispheric FC in brain regions of the DMN (including the left MTG/ITG and left PCC/precuneus), which may serve as an endophenotype for schizophrenia. Furthermore, SVM analysis suggests that, within patients, a combination of the PAS scores of these two clusters may predict clinical response to olanzapine treatment; the prediction was unlikely confounded by age, gender, education level, illness duration or daily dosage of olanzapine. \n\nOur group has previously reported abnormal DMN homogeneity in patients with schizophrenia [ ]. In addition, reduced rsFC within the DMN in patients with schizophrenia has been reported by other groups [ ,  ,  ]. However, these studies did not examine whether disrupted FC in the DMN is primarily contributed by abnormal inter-hemispheric FC and/or intra-hemispheric FC. In the present study, the whole-brain FC was divided into inter-hemispheric FC and intra-hemispheric FC. Our findings suggest that abnormal FC in brain regions of the DMN might be related to reduced inter-hemispheric FC within the left hemisphere. \n\nInterestingly, unaffected siblings also showed reduced inter-hemispheric FC in the DMN (including the left MTG/ITG and left PCC/precuneus) in our study. According to the definition of endophenotype, reduced inter-hemispheric FC in the left MTG/ITG and left PCC/precuneus may represent an endophenotype for schizophrenia. Previously, our group has reported reduced DMN homogeneity in unaffected siblings of patients with schizophrenia [ ]. We also reported reduced gray matter volume in the left MTG in both patients and their unaffected siblings [ , ]. SVM analysis in the present study suggested that a combination of the PAS scores of these two clusters was able to predict clinical response to olanzapine treatment with acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Genes may play a critical role in the reduced inter-hemispheric FC in the DMN. For example, additive genetic effects on the degree of gray matter volume loss in the temporal gyrus over five years have been observed in patients with schizophrenia and unaffected co-twins [ ]. Decreased volume in the MTG has been related to Val allele homozygosity in chronic schizophrenia [ ]. Reduced FC in the DMN has been associated with psychopathology in patients with high genetic loading for schizophrenia [ ]. Therefore, reduced inter-hemispheric FC in the DMN may bear genetic load and serve as an endophenotype for schizophrenia. \n\nDecreased activity in the right precentral gyrus has been observed in schizophrenia [ ]; this finding is consistent with reported functional deficits in the sensorimotor regions in patients with schizophrenia [ ]. Increased FC is usually considered as compensatory reallocation or dedifferentiation to functional deficits in the sensorimotor regions [ ,  ,  ]. The precentral gyrus is the primary motor cortex; whereas the primary somatosensory cortex is located in the postcentral gyrus. Therefore, increased inter-hemispheric FC in the left precentral grus/postcentral gyrus in the present study may be a compensatory effort to functional deficits in these regions. \n\nThe present study has several novel aspects. First, the whole brain FC was divided into inter-hemispheric FC and intra-hemispheric FC, which are helpful for us to understand whether abnormal FC originates from inter-hemispheric FC and/or intra-hemispheric FC in schizophrenia. Second, unaffected siblings were included in the present study; this allowed us to explore potential endophenotypes for schizophrenia. Third, SVM analysis was used to explore whether asymmetry of inter- and/or intra-hemispheric FC can serve as biomarkers to predict clinical response to medication treatment at the individual level; such biomarkers may have great clinical implications as they can help clinicians to make individualized treatment decisions for patients [ ]. Finally, drug-naive, first-episode patients were recruited in the present study, eliminating possible confounding effects of prior medication exposure and the heterogeneity of illness course on brain function [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nIn addition to the relatively small study sample size, the study has some other limitations. First, within patients, the imaging scans were not repeated after 8\u202fweeks of olanzapine treatment. Therefore, the medication treatment effect on functional asymmetry in schizophrenia remains unclear. Second, all patients were treated with olanzapine. Having patients on the same antipsychotic medication olanzapine was helpful to minimize the confounding effects caused by the use of different antipsychotic medications as they may cause differential effects on brain function [ , ]; however, this also comprised the generalizability of the study findings to patients on antipsychotic medications other than olanzapine. Third, a correlation coefficient threshold of   r  \u202f>\u202f0.2 was used to calculate the PAS scores. The choice of such a threshold might affect the findings. However, another threshold of   r  \u202f>\u202f0.25 was tested and led to similar findings. Fourth, although a symmetrical standard template was used to process the data, the influence of potential brain size asymmetry between two hemispheres may not be eliminated completely in the calculation of PAS index. Finally, although a number of strategies were applied to minimize the effect caused by head motion, such an effect may not be eliminated completely in the present study. \n\nIn summary, the present study found reduced inter-hemispheric FC in the DMN and elevated inter-hemispheric FC in the sensorimotor regions in drug naive, first episode schizophrenia, which were preferentially within the left hemisphere. Reduced inter-hemispheric FC in the DMN might serve as an endophenotype for schizophrenia and a predictor for clinical response to olanzapine treatment. Future studies to address the limitations described above and further examine the clinical utility of using disrupted asymmetry of inter- and/or intra-hemispheric FC as a biomarker to predict treatment response in patients with schizophrenia in the clinical settings are warranted. \n\n\n## Role of the funding source \n  \nThe funding sources had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; and decision to submit the manuscript for publication.

Univariate analysis showed reduced activation in ADHD in bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal, striatal, and temporo\u2010parietal regions that overlapped with areas predictive of controls, suggesting the latter are dysfunctional areas in ADHD.

One of the most consistent deficits is in motor response inhibition during the Stop task [Alderson et al.,  ; Rubia et al.,  ; Willcutt et al.,  ], underpinned by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings of reduced activation in key inhibition areas of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), supplementary motor area (SMA) and caudate, as well as temporo\u2010parietal regions [Cubillo et al.,  ,  ; Hart et al.,  ; Passarotti et al.,  ; Pliszka et al.,  ; Rubia,  ; Rubia et al.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , 2013; Smith et al.,  ]. \n\nDespite the fact that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder with consistent evidence for brain structure and function deficits [Cubillo et al.,  ; Nakao et al.,  ; Hart et al.,  ,  ; Rubia,  ; Valera et al., 2007], currently ADHD is diagnosed solely on the basis of subjective clinical and rating measures, which are often unreliable, leading to diagnostic variability between clinicians, cultures and countries [Polanczyk et al.,  ]. Sensitivity of classification of ADHD children with clinical measures based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)\u2010IV criteria has been shown to be 70\u201390% [Weiler et al.,  ], thus misdiagnoses are around 10\u201330%. It is thus highly desirable to develop additional and more reliable diagnostic methods for ADHD patients that rely on objectively measurable neuroimaging data. Attempts to find objective neuroimaging biomarkers for ADHD, however, have been limited by the fact that in traditional univariate group statistical analyses, subjects in both groups tend to overlap in measures that show group differences and effect sizes have been relatively small [Valera et al., 2007], which has made it difficult to make diagnostic predictions at the level of individual subjects. \n\nIn contrast, multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) for imaging data take into account interactions between regions (i.e., brain structure or function patterns) and can make predictions (e.g., of class membership) for individual subjects as opposed to group\u2010level inferences. These methods have been shown to provide sensitive and specific diagnostic indicators for individual patients with other pathologies such as autism, depression, and Alzheimer's disease [Ecker et al.,  ; Marquand et al.,  ; Orru et al.,  ]. \n\nTo date, few imaging studies have used multivariate pattern recognition analyses techniques to classify ADHD patients. A recent competition to apply multivariate methods on a multicenter resting state functional and anatomical imaging dataset of 285 children and adolescents with ADHD and 491 healthy controls (ADHD\u2010200 Consortium;  ) was met by a range of classification approaches including random forests, gradient boosting, multi\u2010kernel learning and support vector machines [Cheng et al.,  ; Colby et al.,  ; Dai et al.,  ; Eloyan et al.,  ]. Accuracies derived by internal cross\u2010validation ranged from 55\u201378%, although the accuracies reported on an external test dataset for which diagnostic labels were withheld were substantially lower [61% for the winning team (Eloyan et al.,  )]. This difference was attributed to a lack of standardization between sites, leading to multiple confounds including missing data, site\u2010specific differences in behavioural measurements, imaging acquisition, processing, and protocols, scanner quality and other unmeasured confounding and mediating variables. Furthermore, the competition dataset was highly unbalanced, with more control subjects than ADHD patients (63% and 37% respectively) and balanced accuracy measures, caclulated as the mean of sensitivity and specificity, that accommodate this imbalance [Broderson et al., 2012] are consistently lower than the figures reported (e.g., 57.5% for the winning team). In addition, the competition scoring rewarded specificity more than sensitivity so that all teams reported high specificity, but poor sensitivity (21% for the winning team). Also, none of the studies used probabilistic classification models such as Gaussian Process Classifiers (GPCs). GPCs are kernel classifiers used in machine learning, similar to support vector machines (SVMs), which have good performance for fMRI [Marquand et al.,  ]. Their main advantage over alternative methods is that they provide estimates of predictive uncertainty and can accommodate unbalanced diagnostic settings or variations in disease prevalence, which are crucial for clinical applications [Hahn et al., 2012]. The only study that used GPC in structural imaging data in ADHD showed that it is possible to accurately classify 29 ADHD patients relative to controls and patients with autism with an accuracy of over 79% based on structural MRI data [Lim et al.,  ]. Lastly, to our knowledge, no study in ADHD has used multivariate classification methods to task\u2010related functional imaging data. \n\nThe aim of the present study was therefore to test the hypothesis that GPCs of task\u2010based fMRI data during the tracking Stop task in 30 boys with and 30 healthy boys can identify distributed neurofunctional patterns that will provide accurate diagnostic predictors of ADHD. The tracking Stop task is individually adjusted for accuracy and involves the inhibition of a pre\u2010potent motor response to a Stop signal that infrequently and unexpectedly follows a go signal. We considered the functional neuroanatomy of the Stop task to be an excellent candidate for a diagnostic biomarker for ADHD since (1) deficits in motor response inhibition in the Stop task are one of the most consistent findings in ADHD [Alderson et al.,  ; Rubia et al.,  ; Willcutt et al.,  ] and (2) fMRI studies using the Stop task consistently report reduced activation in ADHD patients relative to healthy controls in key areas of motor response inhibition such as right VLPFC, SMA, caudate and thalamus [Cubillo et al.,  ; Hart et al.,  ; Pliszka et al.,  ; Rubia et al.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nA secondary aim was to use traditional univariate analyses to replicate previous findings of reduced function in inhibitory regions of VLPFC and the basal ganglia in a relatively large cohort of 30 ADHD patients, given that previous studies were typically conducted in less than 20 subjects [Cubillo et al.,  ; 2013; Passarotti et al.,  ; Pliszka et al.,  ; Rubia et al.,  ,  ,  ,  ,b, 2005] and to test whether discriminating activation patterns from the MVPA overlapped with activations identified in conventional univariate analysis group comparisons. \n\n\n## METHODS AND MATERIALS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSixty right\u2010handed boys aged between 10\u201317 years participated. Thirty boys were recruited from clinics with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD, hyperactive\u2010impulsive/inattentive combined subtype, as assessed by an experienced child psychiatrist using the standardized Maudsley diagnostic interview [Goldberg and Murray,  ] that assesses ADHD according to DSM\u2010IV\u2010TR criteria [American Psychiatric Association, 1994]. ADHD boys scored above clinical threshold for hyperactive\u2010impulsive/inattentive symptoms on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for parents (SDQ) [Goodman et al.,  ], the Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPRS\u2010R) [Conners et al.,  ], and below clinical threshold on the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) [Rutter et al.,  ]. The majority of the ADHD boys were medication naive (  N  \u2009=\u200920). The remainder were taking methylphenidate but discontinued treatment for a 48hr washout period prior to scanning (  N  \u2009=\u20099) or had taken methylphenidate in the past but had discontinued treatment for over a year prior to scanning (  N  \u2009=\u20091). \n\nThirty healthy control boys were recruited through advertisement in the same geographical area. They scored below clinical threshold on the SDQ, SCQ and CPRS\u2010R. \n\nExclusion criteria for all participants were IQ<70 on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) [Wechsler,  ], history of substance abuse or neurological deficits, presence of other psychiatric disorder (except for conduct/oppositional defiant disorder in the ADHD group,   N  \u2009=\u20092), learning disability, reading, speech or language disorder (see Table   for demographic and clinical measures). \n  \nDemographic and clinical data for 30 boys with ADHD and 30 healthy control boys \n    \nOne\u2010way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) showed no significant group differences for age (  F  (1,58)=0.63;   P  \u2009=\u20090.43), but for IQ ((  F  (1,58)=30.379;   P  \u2009<\u20090.001) which is typical in this population [Kuntsi et al.,  ; Polderman et al.,  ]. Although ANCOVA is commonly conducted in case\u2010control studies, this is statistically illegitimate when the covariate is typically associated with the disorder and when, as in this study, groups were not randomly selected. It then becomes meaningless to \u201cadjust\u201d the group effects for differences in the covariate, and ANCOVA cannot be used to control group assignment independent of the covariate as it would alter the group effect in potentially problematic ways, leading to spurious results [Dennis et al.,  ; Miller and Chapman,  ]. Therefore, all analyses were conducted without IQ as a covariate. However, to assess the potential impact of IQ on the classification findings, GPC predictive probabilities were correlated with IQ within each group. \n\nOriginally 34 ADHD boys were scanned, but 3 ADHD boys had to be excluded due to high motion and 1 ADHD boy was excluded due to extreme outlying task performance. \n\nParticipants received \u00a350 per scanning session. Parental and child informed consent/assent and approval from the local Ethical Committee were obtained. \n\n\n### Stop Task \n  \nParticipants practiced the 9\u2010min mixed\u2010trial, event\u2010related tracking fMRI Stop task, which measures the ability to suppress an already triggered motor response [Cubillo et al., 2013; Rubia et al.,  ,  ,  , 2008, 2010, 2013], once prior to scanning. The basic go trials are choice reaction time trials with a mean ITI of 1.8 s, where participants have to respond to go arrows (80% of trials, 236 trials, 1 s duration) pointing either right or left with a right or left button response with the right/left thumb. In 20% of trials (60 trials), the go\u2010signals are followed by stop\u2010signals \u223c250 ms later and participants have to inhibit their motor responses. A tracking algorithm changes the time interval between go\u2010signal and stop\u2010signal onsets in steps of 50 ms according to each subject's performance on previous trials based on the average percentage of inhibition over previous stop trials, recalculated after each stop trial, resulting in 50% successful and 50% unsuccessful inhibition trials [Cubillo et al., 2013; Rubia et al.,  ,  ,  , 2008, 2010, 2013]. The dependent task variables is the Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT), calculated by subtracting the mean stop\u2010signal delay (SSD: average time between go\u2010 and stop\u2010signal, at which the subject inhibited 50% of stop trials) from the mean reaction time (MRT) to go trials, i.e. MRT\u2010SSD [Logan et al.,  ]. Measures of the Go process of the task are the MRT to go trials and intra\u2010subject standard deviation of MRT (SD of MRT) and premature responses (defined as responses made 200 ms before stimulus appearance). \n\n\n### fMRI Data Acquisition \n  \nGradient\u2010echo echoplanar MR imaging (EPI) data were acquired on a GE Signa 3T Horizon HDx system (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) at the Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, UK. A semi\u2010automated quality control procedure ensured consistent image quality [Simmons, 1999]. The body coil was used for RF transmission and an 8 channel headcoil for RF reception. In each of 28 noncontiguous planes parallel to the anterior\u2010posterior commissure, 296 T2*\u2010weighted MR images depicting BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) contrast covering the whole brain were acquired with TE\u2009=\u200930 ms, TR\u2009=\u20091.8 s, flip angle\u2009=\u200975\u00b0, in\u2010plane resolution\u2009=\u20093 mm, slice thickness\u2009=\u20095.5 mm (including slice\u2010skip\u2009=\u20090.5 mm). A high\u2010resolution gradient echo planar image was also acquired in the inter\u2010commissural plane, with TE\u2009=\u200930 ms, TR\u2009=\u20091.8 s, flip angle =9 0\u00b0, 43 slices, slice thickness\u2009=\u20093.0 mm, slice skip\u2009=\u20090.3 mm, 1.875 mm in\u2010plane voxel size (matrix size 128x128), providing complete brain coverage. \n\n\n### Univariate fMRI Data Analysis \n  \nThe software package XBAM was used for univariate analysis ( ) [Brammer et al.,  ]. fMRI data were first processed to minimise motion related artifacts [Bullmore et al.,  ]. A 3D volume consisting of the average intensity at each voxel over the whole experiment was calculated and used as a template. The 3D image volume at each time point was then realigned to this template by computing the combination of rotations (around the   x y   and   z   axes) and translations (in   x y   and   z  ) that maximized the correlation between the image intensities of the volume in question and the template (rigid body registration). Following realignment, data were then smoothed using a Gaussian filter (FWHM 2.354 * in\u2010plane fMRI voxel size mm) to improve the signal to noise characteristics of the images [Bullmore et al.,  ]. \n\nAfter preprocessing, time series analysis for each subject was based on a wavelet\u2010based data resampling method for fMRI data [Bullmore et al.,  ,  ]. At the individual subject level, a standard general linear modelling (GLM) approach was used to obtain estimates of the response size (beta) to the Stop task condition (successful stop trials) against an implicit baseline (go trials). After first\u2010level analysis, the individual statistical maps were normalised into Talairach standard space [Bullmore et al.,  ]. \n\nA group brain activation map was then produced for the contrast successful stop\u2013go trials and hypothesis testing was carried out at the cluster level. The detection of activated voxels is extended from voxel to cluster level using a two\u2010pass method [Bullmore et al.,  ]. We first used a voxel\u2010level threshold of p\u2009<\u20090.05 to give maximum sensitivity and to avoid type II errors. 3D clusters were then built by joining together adjacent significant voxels. Cluster mass (rather than a cluster extent) threshold was used as a second\u2010pass cluster statistic, to minimize discrimination against possible small, strongly responding foci of activation [Bullmore et al.,  ]. The cluster\u2010level threshold was then computed in such a way as to ensure that the final expected number of type I error cluster was less than one per whole brain. For univariate between\u2010group comparisons an ANOVA was carried out comparing controls with ADHD adolescents. \n\n\n### Pattern Recognition Analysis \n  \nGPCs were used to classify ADHD patients from controls on the basis of whole\u2010brain individual beta maps/GLM coefficients for the Stop task obtained from the univariate analysis  ,   i.e., for the contrast of successful Stop \u2013 Go trials. GPC models are Bayesian extensions of logistic regression that aim to learn statistical properties of a set of \u201ctraining\u201d data that enables accurate prediction of the label of unseen (\u201ctest\u201d) data using the rules of probability. For theoretical background and implementation details see [Marquand et al.,  ; Rasmussen, 2006]. The main advantage GPCs hold over alternative methods such as support vector machines is that they provide probabilistic class predictions, thereby accurately quantifying the predictive confidence assigned to each data point. In this work, the GPC modelled the probability of each scan being assigned to the ADHD class (equivalent to 1 minus the probability of each scan being assigned to the control class). \n\nClassifier performance was evaluated using: (i) a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the classifier's true positive rate (sensitivity) against its false positive rate (1\u2010specificity) as the decision threshold is varied, (ii) the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which summarises classifier performance across all decision thresholds, and (iii) classification accuracy, which describes the proportion of correct predictions based at a particular decision threshold. The GPC classifier was trained with leave\u2010one\u2010out cross\u2010validation using the PROBID software package ( ). For each cross\u2010validation iteration, the data were partitioned into training and test sets, excluding a different participant from each group each time. This process was repeated leaving each participant out once, allowing the sensitivity and specificity to be computed respectively as the number of ADHD and control examples correctly classified over all trials. Statistical significance of the classifier was determined by permutation testing, as described previously [Marquand et al.,  ; Rasmussen, 2006]. Briefly, permutation testing was performed by repeatedly retraining the classifier after permuting the class labels (1000 permutations). A   P  \u2010value was computed by counting the number of permutations for which the permuted accuracy was equal or greater than the true (nonpermuted) accuracy, then dividing by 1000. The classifier was trained on a set of whole brain images with only nonbrain tissue masked out. At the given image resolution, this resulted in 21,658 features. \n\nTo examine the discriminative value of different brain regions an unthresholded GPC weight map which shows the relative contribution of each voxel to the classifier decision was generated. In addition, two\u2010tailed Pearson correlation analyses were carried out between GPC predictive probability and ADHD symptom severity using the CPRS ADHD T\u2010scores and SDQ hyperactive\u2010impulsive/inattention scores. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Task Performance \n  \nThe probability of inhibition (PI) did not differ between groups showing that the tracking algorithm worked as expected (  t  \u2009=\u20090.8; df\u2009=\u200958;   P  \u2009=\u20090.4). A multivariate ANOVA between controls and ADHD patients showed a significant group effect (  F   (df\u2009=\u20096, 53)\u2009=\u20093,   P  \u2009<\u20090.01), due to significantly increased intra\u2010subject variance to go trials (  P  \u2009<\u20090.02), and premature responses to go trials (defined as responses made 200 ms before stimulus onset) (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05) in ADHD relative to control boys. However, groups did not differ in the inhibitory measure of the task, the SSRT (Table  ). \n  \nPerformance data for 30 boys with ADHD and 30 healthy control boys \n    \n\n### Brain Activation \n  \n#### Motion \n  \nMANOVAs showed no significant group effects in the three dimensional extent of maximum rotation and translation movement parameters for the   x, y  , and   z   axes (  F  (3,56)=2.6;   P  \u2009=\u2009n.s.) or in the three\u2010dimensional Euclidean space (  F   (1,59)\u2009=\u20090.02,   P  \u2009=\u2009n.s.). \n\n\n#### Gaussian process analysis \n  \nThe ROC curve showed that GPC discriminated between ADHD and control subjects above chance across all decision thresholds (Fig.  A). Accordingly, the AUC for this classifier was 0.81, well above the 0.50 level that would be predicted by chance. At the default decision threshold (i.e., defined by thresholding the probabilistic predictions at 0.5, where a value\u2009>\u20090.5 was deemed to be an ADHD patient), diagnostic classification of patients reached a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 63%, leading to a diagnostic accuracy of 77% (  P  \u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.  B). The positive predictive value (PPV) was 71.05% and the negative predictive value (NPP) was 86.36%. Notably, only 3 ADHD patients were misclassified as healthy controls. The probabilistic predictions derived from the classifier are shown in Figure  B along with the decision threshold. \n  \n A  : Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Each point on the ROC curve describes the performance of the classifier at a particular decision threshold. Points on the lower left\u2010hand side of the ROC graph are \u201cconservative,\u201d requiring strong evidence for a positive classification and therefore have low true and false positive rates (TPR/FPR). Points on the upper right\u2010hand side of the graph are \u201cliberal,\u201d making positive classifications with weak evidence and therefore have a high TPR but also a high FPR. A classifier is more accurate than another if it is closer to the point (1,0), which reflects perfect classification. Chance level is indicated by the dotted diagonal line.   B  : Classification accuracies for GPC predictions for classifying individuals into either the ADHD or the control group. The   x  \u2010axis describes the probability with which each subject is predicted to be an ADHD patient (equal to 1\u2010 the probability of being a control). The dotted line indicates the decision threshold. \n  \nThe discriminating global activation pattern was mapped for the Stop task unthresholded (Fig.  A). Although the discriminating activation pattern is multivariate and therefore encompasses the whole brain, the regions with the highest weight vector coefficients contributing to the delineation between ADHD and healthy boys corresponded to a distributed network of brain regions involved in response inhibition including VLPFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), basal ganglia, thalamus, cingulate, cerebellum and parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices. This discriminating pattern included clusters with magnitude (positive) weights predictive of healthy controls in bilateral VLPFC, DLPFC, and rostromedial frontal cortex, as well as ACC, SMA, and premotor cortices, the basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus), thalamus, inferior parietal lobes, predominantly right superior temporal areas, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus, parahippocampal gyri, right hippocampus, superior lateral cerebellar regions and cerebellar vermis and some medial and lateral occipital areas. The discriminating patterns with high magnitude (negative) weights predictive of ADHD patients included predominantly ventromedial frontal cortex and ACC, with small areas in DLPFC, left precentral gyrus, anterior and posterior insula, thalamus, predominantly left superior temporal areas, in mid\u2010cingulate, precuneus, bilateral amygdala, hippocampus, inferior caudate tail, occipital areas, and more inferior cerebellar regions than the ones predictive of controls. \n  \n A  : Unthresholded GPC weights overlaid on an anatomical template. The color code shows the relative weight of each voxel for the decision boundary (red/yellow scales: higher weights for ADHD boys and blue scales: higher weights for healthy control boys).   B  : The univariate ANOVA group comparison map at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 for voxel and   P  \u2009<\u20090.01 for clusters, showing brain areas that are decreased in activation in ADHD relative to healthy control boys in blue and brain areas that are increased in activation in ADHD relative to healthy control boys in red/yellow. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at  .] \n  \nPearson correlation analyses between GPC predictive probabilities and ADHD symptom severity across all subjects were significant for both CPRS\u2010R ADHD   t  \u2010scores (  r  \u2009=\u20090.4;   P  \u2009<\u20090.001) and SDQ hyperactivity scores (  r  \u2009=\u20090.4;   P  \u2009<\u20090.005). \n\nTo test whether IQ impacted upon the GPC predictive probabilities, we correlated betwen the two measures within each group and across all participants. We found no significant correlations with IQ within each group. However, there was a significant negative correlation between GPC predictive values and IQ across all participants (  r  = \u22120.3;   P  \u2009<\u20090.014). Given that a predictive value of\u2009>\u20090.5 was deemed to be classifying ADHD patients, while a value of\u2009<\u20090.5 was deemed to classify controls (see Fig.  B), the findings suggest that the higher the predictive value for ADHD, the lower the IQ which is in line with the finding of lower IQ values in ADHD relative to controls. There was no correlation across all participants between GPC predictive values and the extent of maximum rotation and translation movement parameters for   x  ,   y  , and   z   axes in the three\u2010dimensional Euclidian space. \n\nGiven that the brain function patterns that classified ADHD patients were in earlier developing regions, we tested whether the GPC classifier was correlated with age across all subjects. In fact there was a trend for a significant negative correlation with age (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.25;   P  \u2009<\u20090.057). \n\nFor comparative purposes, to test whether the imaging\u2010based GPC classification was comparable to a classification based on the clinical behavioral scores, we also conducted a discriminant analysis from group sizes using leave\u2010one\u2010out classification and applying cross\u2010validation to test for sensitivity and specificity of the clinical behavioral scores (i.e. the CPRS and the SDQ for hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive behaviors). The sensitivity (classifying patients) and specificity (classifying controls) were relatively high for both measures: for the CPRS, the sensitivity was 96.3%, the specificity was 100%, and the overall accuracy was 98%; for the SDQ, the sensitivity was 93.3%, the specificity was 100% and the overall accuracy was 96.7%. However, given that groups were selected based on these clinical questionnaires, higher accuracy was to be expected than from the imaging\u2010based GPC measures. \n\n\n#### Univariate analysis results \n  \nANOVA showed that ADHD relative to control boys had reduced activation in two large bilateral clusters in VLPFC reaching subcortically into insula, head of caudate and putamen and in the right hemisphere into superior and middle temporal lobes (Table  , Fig.  B). In addition, they had reduced activation in a cluster comprising globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, putamen, and caudate, in a cluster comprising left superior/middle/inferior temporal and inferior parietal lobe, in a cluster in right fusiform gyrus/inferior temporal lobe and in bilateral precuneus and posterior cingulate. ADHD boys relative to controls had increased activation in a cluster in left cerebellum which extended into bilateral lingual gyrus, cuneus, and PCC (Table  , Fig.  B). \n  \nResults of the univariate analysis, showing brain regions that are (a) underactivated in ADHD boys relative to healthy controls and (b) overactivated in ADHD boys relative to controls \n  \nTo test whether VLPFC areas that differed between groups were correlated with stop signal reaction time (SSRT), we extracted the BOLD response in these areas and correlated these with SSRT. In controls, the activation in right VLPFC cluster was significantly negatively correlated with SSRT (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.4,   P  \u2009<\u20090.02). \n\nTo test whether the cerebellar activation was a compensation for the reduced fronto\u2010striatal activation, as previously observed during attention tasks [Christakou et al.,  ; Cubillo et al.,  ; Rubia et al.,  ], we tested for correlations within ADHD patients between this cluster and left and right VLPFC and the basal ganglia clusters. The (increased) cerebellar activation cluster in fact correlated negatively with the (decreased) activation cluster in the basal ganglia (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.4,   P  \u2009<\u20090.03). \n\nTo test whether IQ had an impact on the group difference findings, statistical BOLD response in each cluster that differed between groups was extracted for each subject and correlated with IQ in each group. No correlations with IQ were observed. \n\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nWe demonstrate that it is possible to classify individual ADHD patients based on their functional neuroanatomy pattern of motor response inhibition, at an accuracy of 77%, with 90% sensitivity to correctly identify ADHD boys and 63% specificity to classify controls. Furthermore, the component regions of the discriminative pattern most predictive of controls were in later developing typical inhibition areas of lateral VLPFC and DLPFC, SMA, ACC, striatal, temporo\u2010parietal and superior cerebellar regions, whilst regions most predictive of ADHD were in earlier developing mostly ventromedial fronto\u2010limbic areas such as ventromedial frontal cortex, ACC, insula, amygdala, hippocampus, and inferior cerebellum. In addition, the GPC predictive probabilities for ADHD patients were correlated with ADHD severity scores, reinforcing their diagnostic utility. The univariate group difference analysis showed that ADHD patients relative to controls had reduced activation in bilateral VLPFC, caudate and temporo\u2010parietal regions, which mostly overlapped with the areas that were predictive of classifying controls, suggesting that these areas that classify controls are dysfunctional areas in ADHD. The overall classification accuracy findings of 77% are promising and, if replicated, suggest that it may be possible in the future to use machine learning based pattern recognition analyses to aid in the diagnostic classification of ADHD with a more objective and reliable measure such as a short task\u2010based fMRI scan. \n\nThe classification accuracy of 77% observed in this study is larger than that obtained in other machine learning studies of resting state functional and anatomical data in ADHD [Cheng et al.,  ; Dai et al.,  , Colby et al.,  ; Eloyan et al.,  ]. They demonstrate for the first time that individuals with ADHD can be differentiated from controls on the basis of their discriminative task\u2010based neurofunctional activation patterns during inhibitory performance. As GPC is a multivariate technique and considers inter\u2010regional correlations, discriminative brain networks should be interpreted cautiously as a spatially distributed pattern rather than permitting inference on the constituent regions. GPC identified a distributed network predictive of controls in later developing lateral and medial fronto\u2010striatal and parieto\u2010temporal regions that are crucial for motor response inhibition [Aron and Poldrack,  ; Cai et al.,  ; Chambers et al.,  ,  ; Juan and Muggleton,  ; Rubia et al.,  ,  , 2013]. Structurally [Sowell et al.,  ,  ] and functionally during inhibition tasks (Adleman et al.,  ; Bunge et al.,  ; Rubia et al.,  ; Rubia et al.,  ; Rubia et al.,  , Rubia et al.,  ) [for review see (Rubia,  )], these lateral prefrontal, striatal and parietal brain regions develop later than the ventromedial prefrontal, limbic (i.e., hippocampus, amygdala) and paralimbic areas (insula) that were predictive of ADHD patients. Our finding of high magnitude weights predictive of controls in later developing lateral fronto\u2010striato\u2010parietal regions and for ADHD in earlier developing ventromedial fronto\u2010limbic regions hence suggest that the ADHD discrimination networks are reflective of more immature activation patterns, while the control discrimination patterns are reflective of a more mature activation pattern for Stop task performance. This was also confirmed in the trend\u2010wise correlation between age and the GPC probabilistic classification pattern. This would be in line with the notion that ADHD is a disorder of developmental delay, as demonstrated in univariate structural longitudinal analyses that showed a 2\u20135 year delay in ADHD patients in the maturation of cortical thickness and surface morphology, most prominently in DLPFC and VLPFC, superior temporal and inferior parietal brain regions [Rubia,  ; Shaw et al.,  ,  ]. \n\nThe significant correlation between the GPC predictive probabilities and ADHD symptom severity suggests that the most severely impaired ADHD patients are more confidently predicted by their immature fronto\u2010limbic activation patterns than the less severely impaired ones, which further reinforces the potential diagnostic value of GPC pattern recognition analyses combined with fMRI for ADHD. \n\nThe univariate ANOVA showed that ADHD boys had a significant reduction in the activation of left and right VLPFC, reaching into caudate and superior temporal lobes, as well as in parieto\u2010temporal regions, replicating previous evidence for consistent fronto\u2010striatal as well as temporo\u2010parietal underactivations in ADHD patients during Stop task performance [Cubillo et al.,  , 2013; Passarotti et al.,  ; Pliszka et al.,  ; Rubia et al.,  ,  ,  , 2008, 2010], as also confirmed in a recent meta\u2010analysis [Hart et al.,  ]. While our findings replicate previous work, this study is, to our knowledge, the largest fMRI ADHD dataset on the Stop task, with previous fMRI studies including less than 20 ADHD patients and controls [Cubillo et al.,  ; 2013; Passarotti et al.,  ; Pliszka et al.,  ; Rubia et al.,  ,  ,  , 2010, 2008]. Interestingly, the key region for inhibitory control, the right VLPFC [Aron et al.,  ; Aron and Poldrack,  ; Chambers et al.,  ; Rubia et al.,  ,  ,  , 2013], that was reduced in ADHD patients relative to controls, was also correlated with the main inhibitory task variable, the SSRT, in controls, even though patients were not impaired in this measure. Patients, however, had a more premature and variable response to go trials. The lack of inhibitory performance deficits despite brain function deficits replicates previous fMRI findings in patients with ADHD [Cubillo et al.,  , 2013; Pliszka et al.,  ; Rubia et al.,  ,  ,  , 2008] and is likely related to the fact that fMRI stop tasks generally have less behavioral sensitivity than neuropsychological task versions due to the target separation and hence larger predictability of stop trials. Also, neuropsychological studies are typically conducted in children, while we studied an older age group of adolescescents who may have grown out of their performance deficits. It is also possible that the enhanced inferior cerebellar and visual cortex activation in ADHD patients relative to controls may have compensated for the reduced fronto\u2010striatal\u2010activations, sparing inhibitory performance deficits. This hypothesis was supported by the negative correlation between cerebellar and striatal activation in ADHD. \n\nMultivariate pattern recognition analyses reveal discriminating activation patterns without necessarily defining the direction of activation. However, the coanalysis of univariate analyses in this study showed that several of the brain areas that were reduced in activation in ADHD relative to control boys in the univariate analyses, in particular left and right VLPFC, the basal ganglia and inferior parietal lobes, overlapped with regions that showed higher weights for discriminating the control group from the ADHD group in the multivariate analysis (see Fig.  A,B), suggesting that they reflect brain areas that are dysfunctional (i.e., underactivated) in ADHD children. \n\nThe fMRI stop task\u2010based classifier was significantly better than inhibitory performance to discriminate between groups, given that performance did not differ between patients and controls. However, while the task\u2010based fMRI classification accuracy of 77% was relatively higher than previous attempts to use MVPRA combined with resting state fMRI data, which achieved only a maximum classification accuracy of 61% for the best classification [Eloyan et al.,  ], and was comparable to our accuracy of 79% using GPC analyses combined with brain structure data [Lim et al.,  ], the classification accuracy is nevertheless not high enough to be used in isolation, even if replicated. The discriminant analysis based on clinical measures was substantially higher, in particular for specificity, which was 100% relative to only 77% for the fMRI based GPC classification, while the sensitivity measures for the ADHD classification were relatively comparable, with 93.3% and 96.3% for the clinical measures, and 90% for the fMRI\u2010 based GPC analysis. However, given that disorders were selected based on these clinical measures, the higher classification accuracy based on these measures was to be expected as clinical diagnostic measures were used as labels for the fMRI\u2010based classifier. Studies that tested for the sensitivity of classification of ADHD children with clinical measures based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)\u2010IV criteria have shown that this is between 70\u201390% [Weiler et al.,  ], thus misdiagnoses are around 10\u201330%. Task\u2010based fMRI classification, if replicated across centers and scanners, may therefore have its use as an adjunct to clinical diagnostic measures, in particular for difficult to diagnose cases. However, for its potential use as aid for clinical diagnosis, future studies will have to show disorder\u2010specificity of fMRI based individual classifications relative to other childhood disorders, as differential diagnosis is typically more challenging than differentiation from controls. For structural MRI classifications we have shown relatively high disorder\u2010specific accuracy relative to children with autism of over 80% [Lim et al.,  ]. \n\nA strength of the study is the relatively large sample, in particular for the univariate analysis. A limitation is the potential confound of IQ differences between cases and controls. However, GPC probabilistic predictors did not correlate with IQ in either group and hence are unlikely to have affected the findings. The univariate analysis results did not correlate with IQ in either group. Furthermore, Stop task performance has been shown to be independent of IQ [Friedman et al.,  ]. IQ correlated with GPC predictive values across both groups, which is, however to be expected, given that both groups differed in IQ and in predictive GPC values (the latter, by definition). Another limitation is that we only included males and the combined hyperactive\u2010impulsive/inattentive subtype of ADHD which limits the generalizability of the diagnostic classification patterns. Also, future diagnostic utility of pattern classification analyses will rely on its ability to classify ADHD subgroups as to determine disorder\u2010specificity of classification patterns. \n\nIn summary, to our knowledge this is the first study to use multivariate machine\u2010learning techniques to predict ADHD diagnosis based on task\u2010based fMRI imaging data showing a classification accuracy of 77%. Whilst classification algorithms are not meant as a substitute for clinical assessment and diagnosis, they may be a useful objective, automated, and reliable complementary diagnostic tool that could reduce variability in clinical practice and, ultimately, may help to improve diagnostic accuracy or to revise clinical diagnosis through biomarker classification of uncertain diagnostic cases. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: hbm22386-tbl-0001\n### Label: Table 1\nDemographic/clinical measures\tControls Mean (SD)\tADHD Mean (SD)\nAge (years, month)\t14.1 (2.5)\t13.9 (2)\nIQ\t109 (12)\t92 (11)\nConners Parent Rating Scale\t45 (4)\t79 (8)\nSDQ Hyperactive\u2010impulsive/inattentive behaviours\t1.9 (2)\t8.6 (1.5)\nSocial Communication Questionnaire\t1.0 (1)\t9 (4.6)\n### Caption\nDemographic and clinical data for 30 boys with ADHD and 30 healthy control boys\n### Footer\nSDQ, strength and difficulty questionnaire.\n\n\n## ID: hbm22386-tbl-0002\n### Label: Table 2\nPerformance variable\tControls mean (SD)\tADHD mean (SD)\nPI (%)\t50.7 (2.8)\t50.1 (3.4)\nSSRT (ms)\t168.0 (102.4)\t131.2 (93.3)\nSSD (ms)\t427.4 (139.1)\t472.2 (81.0)\nMRT go trials (ms)\t586.8 (114.6)\t587.5 (96.6)\nSD go trials (ms)\t161.6 (50.6)\t189.3 (36.0)\nPremature responses (%)\t1.2 (1.7)\t3.2 (5.2)\n### Caption\nPerformance data for 30 boys with ADHD and 30 healthy control boys\n### Footer\nPI, probability of inhibition; SSRT, stop signal reaction time; SSD, average stop signal delay, i.e. time between go and stop signal; MRT, mean reaction time; SD, intra\u2010subject standard deviation.\n\n\n## ID: hbm22386-tbl-0003\n### Label: Table 3\nCluster Size\tTalairach coordinates\tTalairach coordinates\tTalairach coordinates\tP value\tBrodman Area (BA)\tBrain region\nCluster Size\tx\ty\tz\tP value\tBrodman Area (BA)\tBrain region\n(a) Controls\u2009>\u2009ADHD\t(a) Controls\u2009>\u2009ADHD\t(a) Controls\u2009>\u2009ADHD\t(a) Controls\u2009>\u2009ADHD\t(a) Controls\u2009>\u2009ADHD\t(a) Controls\u2009>\u2009ADHD\t(a) Controls\u2009>\u2009ADHD\n175\t28\t25\t\u221213\t0.001833\t47/11/45/38/21\tR VLPFC/superior & middle temporal lobe/insula/caudate head/putamen\n164\t\u221236\t25\t\u22129\t0.001558\t47/11/45\tL VLPFC/insula/caudate head/putamen\n75\t\u22123\t14\t\u221219\t0.009029\t/\tB globus pallidus/nucleus accumbens/ putamen/caudate\n106\t\u221243\t\u221240\t6\t0.002512\t22/21/39/41/40\tL superior/middle/inferior temporal/ inferior parietal lobe\n131\t39\t\u221259\t\u221213\t0.001487\t20/37\tR fusiform gyrus/inferior temporal lobe\n81\t\u221250\t\u221244\t26\t0.006506\t40\tL inferior parietal lobe\n91\t\u22127\t\u221274\t39\t0.007072\t7/31\tL precuneus/posterior cingulate\n122\t21\t\u221259\t26\t0.002122\t7/31\tR precuneus/posterior cingulate\n(b) ADHD\u2009>\u2009Controls\t(b) ADHD\u2009>\u2009Controls\t(b) ADHD\u2009>\u2009Controls\t(b) ADHD\u2009>\u2009Controls\t(b) ADHD\u2009>\u2009Controls\t(b) ADHD\u2009>\u2009Controls\t(b) ADHD\u2009>\u2009Controls\n615\t\u221225\t\u221266\t\u22126\t0.000094\t18/19/30\tL Cerebellum, lingual gyrus, posterior cingulate\n### Caption\nResults of the univariate analysis, showing brain regions that are (a) underactivated in ADHD boys relative to healthy controls and (b) overactivated in ADHD boys relative to controls\n### Footer\nNone\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4190683, "text_md5": "cd543fe4ef94bea0d1677d15ec7be8d8", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 159], "journal": [160, 174], "publication_year": [176, 180], "title": [191, 304], "keywords": [318, 420], "abstract": [433, 2378], "body": [2387, 40717], "tables": [40730, 43212]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 24123508, "doi": "10.1002/hbm.22386", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4190683", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4190683"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4190683\">4190683</a>", "list_title": "PMC4190683  Pattern classification of response inhibition in ADHD: Toward the development of neurobiological markers for ADHD"}

CS is a visual mode of communicating a spoken language through a set of manual cues which accompany lipreading and disambiguate it. With CS, sublexical units of the oral language are conveyed clearly and completely through the visual modality without requiring hearing. The comparison of neural processing of CS in deaf individuals with processing of audiovisual (AV) speech in normally hearing individuals represents a unique opportunity to explore the similarities and differences in neural processing of an oral language delivered in a visuo-manual vs. an AV modality. The study included deaf adult participants who were early CS users and native hearing users of French who process speech audiovisually. Words were presented in an event-related fMRI design. Three conditions were presented to each group of participants. The deaf participants saw CS words (manual + lipread), words presented as manual cues alone, and words presented to be lipread without manual cues. The hearing group saw AV spoken words, audio-alone and lipread-alone. Three findings are highlighted. First, the middle and superior temporal gyrus (excluding Heschl\u2019s gyrus) and left inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis constituted a common, amodal neural basis for AV and CS perception. Second, integration was inferred in posterior parts of superior temporal sulcus for audio and lipread information in AV speech, but in the occipito-temporal junction, including MT/V5, for the manual cues and lipreading in CS. Third, the perception of manual cues showed a much greater overlap with the regions activated by CS (manual + lipreading) than lipreading alone did. This supports the notion that manual cues play a larger role than lipreading for CS processing. The present study contributes to a better understanding of the role of manual cues as support of visual speech perception in the framework of the multimodal nature of human communication. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThere is increasing evidence that sensory-deprived individuals make adjustments to their sensory loss in order to interact effectively within their environment. These adaptations are linked to changes occurring at multiple regions of the brain ( ). For people who are deaf from birth or lost their audition early in life, neural plasticity of the regions classically associated with auditory and speech sound processing is related not only to lack of auditory experience but also to the timing and nature of language experience ( ). Among the children born deaf, the majority is born to hearing parents, and only 5% have deaf parents. The modality in which language is conveyed can be very different from one deaf child to another: from auditory-oral (listening, talking, and lipreading and facial expressions, known as speechreading), to visual communication strategies like Cued Speech (CS, supporting perception of spoken language with hand shapes that disambiguate lipreading, see below), and/or Sign Language (SL, sign for each language concept, with a grammar of its own). Recently,   suggested that the nature of language experience (signed vs. oral) has an impact on the development of gray matter volume in the cerebral regions processing language measured in deaf adults, but this point remains to be confirmed. \n\nThe timing of language experience can also vary among deaf children. Some of them have daily access to a fully perceivable linguistic input through SL or CS during the first year(s) of life when cerebral plasticity is as its greatest ( ) while others only have partial access to auditory input (via the cochlear implant) and/or a late access (after the age of 4 years) to visual languages like SL and CS. For instance, deaf children who use SL from early in infancy outperform deaf children who are late learners in tests of SL proficiency and even in tests of English proficiency ( ,  ). Those children who are exposed to SL only at a later age show long-term language deficits ( ;  ). Delayed acquisition of SL as a first language is related to structural changes in the visual cortex (less gray-matter concentration in V1/V2 and V3a/V7 in late signers), and this effect is independent of auditory deprivation ( ). \n\nHere we tested, for the first time to our knowledge, the language neural processing of congenitally deaf adults who were exposed from early years to spoken language fully perceivable through the visual modality. Since spoken language has evolved to be primarily heard, not seen, critical features like voicing or nasality cannot be perceived by eye only. Among systems dedicated to make spoken language entirely visible to deaf persons, CS is the most widespread one. \n\nCued Speech ( ) is a visual communication system used with and among deaf and hard-of-hearing persons. It is a system which delivers consonant-vowel (CV) dyads in the spoken language using a small number of handshapes and locations as a supplement to lipreading (see   Figure    for the English and French versions of CS). Handshapes and the location in space where the hand is placed combined with the mouth movements of speech make all the syllables and phonemes of spoken language appear distinct from each other. Consonants that have similar mouth movements (like /p/, /b/ and /m/) are coded with different handshapes (1, 4, and 5, respectively). Consonants that are coded by the same handshape (like /p/, /d/ and /\u01b7/) are easily distinguished by lipreading. Vowels indistinguishable on the lips (for instance French /y/ and /u/) are coded at different hand locations, and the same location is used to code vowels different on the lips. \n  \n The French and English Cued Speech codes.   Complete diagram of hand shapes and hand positions of French and English CS. In CS, the speaker holds one hand near the mouth while speaking to complement lipreading with a manual cue. A cue in CS is made of two parameters: hand shape   (left)   and hand position of execution around the mouth   (right)  . For example, syllables as /pa/, /ba/ or /ma/ cannot be distinguished using lipreading because they provide similar visual information. In CS, the syllables /pa/, /ba/ or /ma/ can be easily distinguished by simply using three different hand shapes. \n  \nEach time a speaker pronounces a CV syllable, he/she adds manually information about the word\u2019s phonological structure that is not entirely visible on the lips, by producing a handshape at a particular location in relation to the head and upper body (see   Figure   ). Take the example of a speaker producing the syllable /pa/. From the lips, the receiver perceives /pa/, /ba/, or /ma/. When the manual cue is added (i.e., handshape n\u00b0 1 representing /p, d, j/, produced at the side of the face representing /a, oe, o/ vowels), the uncertainty is reduced, and the syllable /pa/ remains the only possibility. Indeed, /ba/ and /ma/ are eliminated on the basis of the information read from the handshape, and /da/ and /ja/ are incompatible with the information read on the lips. From this example, it clearly appears that CS handshapes and hand locations are not themselves interpretable as syllables or phonemes. The integration of manual and labial information is mandatory to perceive an unambiguous syllable. Deaf users of CS are thus afforded access to the words in a spoken language in which sublexical features are entirely specified solely by visible articulatory gestures, i.e., manual cues and mouth movements. \n\nCued Speech was created in the 1960s with the aim of allowing deaf children to accurately perceive spoken language and improving their literacy skills ( ;  ). However, the overall effect of CS on early spoken language development extends beyond this ( ,  ,  ). The empirical evidence collected in English, French, Spanish, Farsi and even Amharic (national language of Ethiopia) shows that congenitally deaf children who were exposed to CS from their earliest months by their parents and other caregivers can reach levels of mastery of spoken (phonology, lexical, morpho-syntactic) language and written language (word reading, reading comprehension, spelling) within range of age-matched hearing peers when tested at school age. Children with late and less intensive exposure (i.e., at the age of 5\u20136 years, and at school only) do not demonstrate the outstanding phonological and reading abilities of the early CS-users, confirming the existence of a sensitive period for language acquisition via the visual modality ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nIt is this evidence for comparable language abilities reached by congenitally deaf individuals who are early CS-users and NH individuals which raise our interest concerning how the human brain processes linguistic information when conveyed by handshapes and speech-based mouth actions, compared to when conveyed by AV speech. To put this research into perspective, we summarize below critical points about auditory speech processing stream and the way in which lipread signals are integrated with the auditory speech stream. Next the neural basis of visual language perception (SL and speechreading) in deaf participants is discussed. We address the commonalities and differences between SL and CS. Finally, the knowledge about time course of manual and mouth movements articulation in CS is summarized, introducing our three research hypotheses concerning the comparison of neural activation of CS and AV speech. \n\n### Neural Basis of Audiovisual Speech Processing \n  \nFor hearing people, speech perception is a multimodal phenomenon. It is known since long that vision is of great help for hearing in noise and adverse conditions ( ;  ). The neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of audiovisual (AV) interactions in the human cortex have been abundantly explored in the last 15 years (see   for a review;  ,  ;  ). The acoustic speech signal projects posteriorly from Heschl\u2019s convolutions within lateral temporal cortex to further superior temporal regions (secondary auditory cortex). The mid-posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) appears to be a prominent site for AV speech integration ( ;  ;  ;  ), with yet more posterior regions around the temporo-parietal sulcus being implicated specifically in lip movement perception (see  ). \n\nNeuroanatomical studies displayed three types of AV interactions. First, there are direct connections between sensory cortices ( ). Second, associative areas and particularly the pSTS play a crucial role in AV speech perception (e.g.,  ,  ). Third, parieto-frontal areas related to speech production are involved through the dorsal route (see  ;  ,  ;  ). Electrophysiological studies revealed that the influence of visual speech in cortical auditory processing can occur within 100 ms of signal onset, suggesting that lipreading exerts an early effect on auditory signal resolution ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Neural Activity Related to Lipreading \n  \nSince two decades now, the cortical substrates for lipreading in hearing and deaf participants have been widely investigated with neuroimaging techniques. In hearing people, silent lipreading engages activation of pSTS and middle temporal gyrus, and inferior frontal regions ( ,  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ). These regions are similar to those engaged when speech is heard. Activation of left pSTS is correlated with hearing participant\u2019s lipreading skills ( ). \n\nSome deaf individuals become better lipreaders than normally hearing individuals, i.e., deaf individuals may be better than hearing persons to extract information about spoken language structure from visible lip movements, jaws, and face ( ;  ;  ). The variability among deaf individuals is partly explained by their practice and knowledge of oral language. Indeed, those deaf individuals exposed daily to CS from their early years become very proficient lipreaders ( ), likely because precise lipreading is a mandatory component in CS perception. \n\nVariability among deaf lipreaders also appears in neuroanatomical studies.   asked deaf and hearing participants to silently lipread numbers (from 1 to 9) in a scanner. They found that temporal activation was more dispersed on different sites and less intense in the group of deaf participants. They suggested that coherent exposition to AV speech may play an important role for the structuration of temporal cortex for visual speech. In a second study,   found that the cingular cortex is a structure more activated during lipreading in deaf people than in hearing ones. A conjunction analysis of the data of these two studies revealed posterior activation of cingular cortex (BA23/30, related to visuo-spatial functions) in the deaf adults, and a bilateral activation of superior temporal areas (BA22/42) in the hearing adults. The deaf group showed activation of superior temporal gyrus (BA22) on the right side, extending into the tip of Heschl\u2019s gyrus (BA42, part of the secondary auditory cortex), suggesting a predominantly right lateralized network in deaf people. \n\n realized a further study in which congenitally deaf adults who were native signers and proficient speechreaders and hearing non-signing controls searched for a lipread target (the word \u201cyes\u201d) embedded in lists of silently spoken unrelated words from an open list. Participants pushed a button only when they identified the target word. The control condition was a speaker at rest. The results showed a strong activation of temporal superior gyrus, and in regions located in the Heschl\u2019s gyrus, especially on the left side, in deaf as well as in hearing participants. Inferior frontal gyrus was also activated in both groups, which may reflect the involvement of mirror neurons in lipreading ( ;  ;  ). Lipreading ability was assessed outside the scanner, with the Test of Adult Speechreading (TAS,  ). In deaf participants, the neural activations during lipreading were positively correlated with the TAS score. Deaf participants showed greater activation than hearing participants in the left temporal cortex, including the planum temporale and Heschl\u2019s gyrus. Compared to the two previous studies, the   one differed on a number of variables (nature of the baseline task, task requirement, stimulus type, and size of the group of deaf participants). These variables can possibly explain the differences in the results obtained (see  , p. 1239). The conclusion is particularly relevant to our study: the authors assumed that if the superior temporal cortex is not used to process auditory speech, it may be recruited to process visual speech, to a larger extent than in hearing participants in whom AV speech perception is dominant (see also  ;   for related data). \n\nPart of the activation induced by lipreading must be related to visual movement detection and to the perception of biological movement, especially in the inferior and posterior regions of the temporal cortex ( ). But most of the activation in superior temporal regions is related to lipreading itself. Therefore, the observation of more activation related to lipreading in deaf individuals than in hearing people in the pSTS suggests the following interpretation. The pSTS is an AV integration site in hearing people, but cannot play this role in deaf individuals. The activation of pSTS could be sensitive to the dominant language modality. This multimodal region could have developed sensitivity to visual speech for deaf individuals, and to auditory speech, and secondary to visual speech for hearing ones. Given that our early CS-users participants did not hear during their early years, and have been intensively exposed to lipreading + manual cues in daily communication, one may expect to observe a strong activation of pSTS during CS perception. \n\n\n### Neural Activity Related to Sign Language \n  \nSign language is the preferred means of communication for most of deaf persons. Deaf persons use visible actions from the hands, the head and the trunk to communicate meanings using phonological, lexical and morpho-grammatical rules. The articulators are visible gestures, and language perception is in the visuo-spatial modality. SLs are adapted to the human\u2019s processing abilities in the visual modality, as are spoken languages in the auditory modality ( ). For instance, signs take longer to be articulated, but the mean duration of utterances is similar in SL and in English for ASL-English bilinguals ( ). \n\nSimilarities between sign and spoken language processing have been abundantly demonstrated. Lesion-based, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological studies have provided strong evidence for the importance of left perisylvian regions during production and perception-comprehension of signed as well as spoken languages ( ;  ;  ;  ). The left inferior frontal gyrus is involved in both sign and speech production while the left superior temporal gyrus and sulcus, in addition to the left inferior frontal gyrus, are involved in sign and spoken language perception-comprehension. \n\nDifferences related to the visual signal delivered by the articulatory gestures have been revealed between AV seen speech (lipreading) and SL perception ( ;  ;  ;  ). The kinematic characteristics of SL and AV speech are very different. There is more movement in the moving image of sign than speech. Different parts of the visual recognition system are sensitive to movements of particular body-parts (mouth specific vs. hand specific regions in inferior temporal cortex, see  ). The articulators in AV speech and SL thus have different timing, dynamic, and visibility, and their perception elicit different brain activity. SL perception induces greater activation than AV speech in movement processing regions of the posterior temporal gyri, bilaterally, while AV speech perception generates greater activation than SL in auditory processing regions in superior temporal cortices, including the planum temporale ( ;  ). \n\nOf particular relevance for the present study is the fact that some signs require mouth movements in addition to manual movements. Some of these mouth movements allow distinguishing minimal pairs of signs in SL ( ;  ). Activations corresponding to mouth movements, distinct from those related to hand movements have been found during SL perception ( ). Compared to manual only signs, signs including mouth movement elicit more activation in middle and posterior portions of the superior and middle temporal gyri, and in the inferior and middle frontal gyri, bilaterally. The manual only signs elicited activation in the right occipito-temporal cortex, and the fusiform gyrus. As the moving hand adopting several distinct configurations around the face is a important articulator in CS (see   Figure   ), one may expect to find more activation in the temporal posterior regions, and perhaps in the temporo-occipital posterior inferior regions in CS than in AV speech. \n\n\n### Similarities and Differences between CS and SL \n  \nCued Speech, such as cued American English, has similarities and differences with SL. Like SL, CS is conveyed in the visual modality and can be used for social communication, as evidenced by interactions within the family unit, and among \u201ccuers\u201d in social events. Similarly to SL, the use of voice is not needed in order to communicate in CS: \u201ccuers\u201d can achieve 100% speech perception when manual cues and mouth movements are presented, without sound ( ). Finally, for SL as for CS, presentation of a single phonological parameter of the lexeme cannot, on its own, generate a lexical item (similar handshapes and hand locations occur with multiple lexemes in CS, as similar handshapes do in SL). Even more relevant to the present study is the fact that some signs requiring mouth actions in SL cannot be interpreted unambiguously at the lexical level when presented in isolation (see  ). This is also the case in CS where the manual cues cannot, on their own, generate access to a lexical item. Accurate perception of CS thus necessarily involves the integration of manual and labial information in order to achieve a specific lexical representation. That is, for CS as well as for SL, individual sublexical features of articulation must be integrated to allow access to a specific lexical representation. \n\nThere are also differences between CS and SL. First, CS is not a language, but rather a visual mode of communication of spoken language. CS is isomorphic to speech: it is a visual representation of the syllables and phonemes of spoken language while SLs have their own phonology based on manual articulatory parameters of hand location, handshapes, movement, and palm orientation ( ). Second, CS handshapes are produced at a much more rapid rate than SL. The production of handshapes at different locations around the face follows the rate of spoken speech, meaning that the CS receiver must decode a rapid succession of changing handshapes and hand placements, in a space located from the speaker\u2019s eyes to the throat ( ,  ). In order to formulate more precise predictions about activations related to CS perception, it may be useful to know what has been revealed so far about the time course of mouth and hand movements in CS. This is the topic of the next section. \n\n\n### What Do We Know about Perception and Production of CS? \n  \n were the first to examine the precise temporal organization of CS production of syllables, words and sentences. Natural production of CS is characterized by a temporal anticipation of manual gesture over mouth opening: the hand movement begins up to 240 ms before the acoustic onset of a CV syllable, and the target position corresponding to the vowel is reached during the mouth production of the consonant, well before the vowel lip target. At the receptive level, deaf CS-users anticipate the linguistic target on the basis of \u201creading\u201d the manual gesture: perception of the hand gives the first input for the selection of the possible phonemes pronounced, and the lips follow with the solution. Deaf people seem to extract first phonological information when a manual cue is produced, reducing the potential number of words compatible with the lipread signal.   data suggest that manual cues, as opposed to lipread information, can be the primary source of phonological information for deaf early CS users. Lipread information would then disambiguate the information provided by the manual cues ( ,  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Predictions Concerning the Neural Activation for AV Speech versus CS Perception? \n  \nIn this study, we compare the neural activations created by processing of spoken language produced and perceived through two different modalities: AV and CS. We control for language experience by testing only native users: NH participants with the AV material, and congenitally deaf participants with the CS material. We address three research questions. First, what are the similarities and differences between the processing of CS by early CS-users and the processing of AV speech by NH participants? This comparison is designed to explore common regions of activation for spoken language, independent of modality. Our second research question concerns the neural basis for integration of manual cues and lipread information. In CS, integration is mandatory and concerns two types of dynamic visible information, i.e., the movements of labial and manual articulators. In AV speech, integration concerns two modalities that are congruent in terms of their articulatory origins: the heard and seen results of movements of the oral articulators. We expected to find the pSTS as site of integration for AV speech, and we wanted to document brain regions critical for CS integration. Our third research question concerned the relative activation created by manual cues only and lipreading cues only compared to the activation created by the combined movements of lips and hands in CS. Some authors have suggested that the manual component of CS delivers more useful information than the lipread component to get access to the lexicon ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ). We hypothesize that the cortical activations may reveal greater activation for unisensory manual than labial movements, but also indicate specific locus/loci for integration of manual and labial information, different from those reported for AV integration. \n\n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Ethics Statement \n  \nAll participants gave written informed consent to participate in this study, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of the ULB Erasme Hospital, and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (BMJ 1991; 302: 1194). \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nTwo groups of participants were recruited. The   CS group   consisted of 14 participants (3 males, 11 females), with a mean age of 25.0 years (age range = 18\u201333 years). All participants but one were congenitally profoundly deaf, with a binaural hearing loss > 90 dB (computed on 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) in their better ear. The remaining participant had a severe hearing loss (i.e., between 71 and 90 dB at the better ear). All deaf participants were equipped with hearing aids since they were between 6 months and 2 years of age, and none had a cochlear implant. \n\nThe   NH group   consisted of 15 normally hearing French-speaking participants (six males, nine females), with no knowledge of CS. Their mean age was 25 years 2 months (age range = 20\u201337 years). \n\nSince native language involves a different brain network than second languages learned later in life ( ), only participants who were native French speakers were selected. A participant was considered a native language user if he/she had received consistent, age-appropriate speech stimulation from fluent users of French before the age of 3 years ( ). Currently, this criterion for native CS user can only be fulfilled within the deaf community, since nearly all NH people with an experience in French CS learned it later in their life. Consequently, only neural activity from deaf CS participants who were exposed at an   early (i.e., prelingual) age   is an appropriate comparison for the patterns of neural activity observed in native French speaking hearing participants. \n\nThe deaf participants of the CS group in our study self-reported French as their native language in a questionnaire completed prior to enrolling in the study. They had been exposed to French CS, at home from their parents before the age of 3 years, and at school via teachers and or via transliterators from spoken French to French CS. Participants also reported that French CS was the language most commonly used during their childhood/adolescence, although most of them also learned SL informally during this period in contacts with deaf peers. The CS users reported that they still use CS often today, in daily communication with their family or other deaf persons. They also used oral French to communicate with NH individuals. The NH transliterator gave qualitative feedback about deaf participants\u2019 CS comprehension: all of them could easily understand normal cued French conversation and were good at lipreading. All CS participants had finished secondary school (high school), and 50% (  n   = 7) had either completed a post-graduate program or were in one at the time of the testing. \n\nAll deaf and hearing participants were right handed, with no known neurological or behavioral disorder. \n\n\n### Experimental fMRI Design (Procedure) \n  \nIn an event-related paradigm, a baseline condition and three experimental conditions were presented randomly intermixed to each group of participants. For deaf participants, the experimental conditions consisted of stimuli presented in CS (lipreading + manual cues), in lipreading alone, or in handshapes alone. For NH participants, the experimental conditions consisted of stimuli presented in AV, in auditory speech alone, or in lipreading alone. For both groups, the baseline condition consisted of a motionless face. \n\n#### Experimental Task and Conditions \n  \nIn the experimental conditions, all participants watched videos of a hearing female French speaker (who was a professional CS transliterator) saying a randomized list of 45 bisyllabic frequent words ( ) (see Annex for the full list of words used in this experiment) under six conditions (three for the NH group and three for the CS group; see below). All videos were recorded indoor (in a room). The female speaker was so positioned that her back was in contact with a white wall. She looked straight to the camera. Her full face and torso were shown in all videos in order to present a naturalistic display of CS. \n\nIn the   NH group  , participants performed the detection task under three different experimental conditions: (1) the speech AV condition, in which the speaker pronounced the word while the same word was presented orally through MR-compatible earphones, (2) the auditory alone (A) condition, in which the word was presented aurally but the speaker\u2019s face remained motionless, and (3) the lipreading alone (L) condition, in which the speaker pronounced the word but no auditory information was provided. In the   CS group  , participants performed also the detection task under three different experimental conditions: (1) the Cued Speech labial + manual (CSLM) condition, in which both lip movements and manual cues were visible, (2) the CS manual (CSM) condition, in which only hand movements were provided, but the speaker\u2019s face remained still (no lips movements), and (3) the CS labial (CSL) condition, equivalent to lipreading, in which the speaker pronounced the word, but no manual movements were provided. \n\nFor each condition, one video corresponded to one word. Altogether, there were 270 videos (i.e., 45 for each condition). Importantly, there was no manipulation of videos from one condition to another. For example, for the CSM condition, we did not create CS manual videos removing the lips information from the CS labial + manual videos. Instead, we recorded 45 videos in which the speaker had to produce the 45 words using only hand movements. Seemingly, in the CSL condition (lipreading condition), we recorded 45 videos in which the speaker pronounced the word without hand movements. The dynamic of both, hand movements produced in CSM videos and lip movements produced in CSL videos, have a great likeness when compared to the CSLM condition. \n\nThe same words were used in all conditions but in different orders between conditions. In each of the three conditions, the target word \u201cpapa\u201d (i.e., daddy) was included in the list of stimuli. In order to ensure focused attention to the stimuli, participants were asked to press a button when they detected \u201cpapa\u201d (i.e., daddy). \n\n\n#### Control Task \u2013 Baseline Condition \n  \nIn order to control for attention, motor response parameters, and perception of a face and a body, a second task was designed. In this control task, all participants saw a still picture of the speaker\u2019s full face and torso on screen, as in the experimental task (45 trials). They had to press a button when a small red circle was superimposed on the speaker\u2019s chin. The group conditions are summarized in   Table   . \n  \nContrasts of the experimental conditions and the control condition. \n  \n\n#### Procedure \n  \nBefore the presentation of each video, a white cross was displayed in the middle of the screen, indicating that the stimulus material (i.e., the video) would appear randomly within 1900\u20132800 ms. Then, the video containing the stimuli was displayed. The length of each video was also randomly assigned within 1900 and 2800 ms but, for all six conditions, they had the same mean of 2370 ms and the same standard deviation of 220 ms. In order to do this, we recorded each video with a length of 3 s, but leaving always a silent space at the end of at least 1200 ms in which the speaker\u2019s face and torso remained present but still. This allowed us to adjust the required length for each video (by cutting the necessary time needed for each video). After the presentation of each video stimulus, a question mark appeared on the screen for 2000 ms, reminding the participant to press a button on the MR-compatible keypad (fORP; Current Designs) only if the participant had perceived the target word (i.e., \u201cpapa\u201d), in one of the experimental conditions, or the target circle in the still control task. The target word or red circle appeared eight times within each condition. \n\nPresentation of the stimuli was randomized across the three experimental and the control conditions. Presentation of the stimuli and recording of the participant\u2019s responses were realized using Cogent Graphics (running on Matlab  6.1) developed by John Romaya at the LON at the Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience. All participants practiced the tasks outside of the scanner beforehand to minimize task-learning effects. fMRI data acquisition had an approximate duration of 30 min. \n\n\n\n### fMRI Data Acquisition \n  \nData were acquired on a Philips Achieva 3-T (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) scanner using a T2  sensitive gradient echo (EPI) sequence (TR = 2130 ms, TE = , 40 ms, FA 90\u00b0, SENSE acceleration factor 2.5, matrix size 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 32; voxel size: 3.06 mm \u00d7 3.06 mm \u00d7 3 mm). Thirty-two contiguous 3-mm thick transverse slices were acquired, covering the whole brain. An approximate number of 840 EPI volumes per participant was acquired across the four conditions. Additionally, an anatomical image was obtained using a T1-weigthed sagittal 3D MP-RAGE sequence (TR 1960 ms, TE 4.60 ms, TI 1040 ms, flip angle 8\u00b0, FOV 250 mm \u00d7 250 mm, matrix size 320 \u00d7 320 \u00d7 160, interpolated voxel size: 0.78 \u00d7 0.78 \u00d7 1.0 mm). The MR scanner was equipped with the Quasar imaging gradients and an eight channel SENSE head coil. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Analysis \n  \nFunctional MRI data were pre-processed and analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) implemented in MATLAB 7.8 (Mathworks Inc., Sherbom, MA, USA). The first five functional EPI volumes were discarded to avoid magnetic saturation effects. The remaining EPI images were realigned ( ), spatially normalized into standard stereotactic MNI space ( ), and smoothed spatially at 8 mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) ( ). \n\nData were analyzed using a mixed-random effects (RFX) model aimed at showing a stereotypical effect in the population from which the subjects were drawn ( ). For each subject, a first-level, intra-individual analysis aimed at modeling data to partition observed neurophysiological responses into components of interest, confounds, and errors, using a general linear model ( ). The regressors of interest were built using stick functions corresponding to the four conditions (45 stimuli each). These regressors were secondarily convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Movement parameters derived from realignment of the functional volumes (translations in x, y, and z directions and rotations around x, y, and z axes) were included as covariates of no interest in the design matrix. High-pass filtering was implemented in the matrix design using a cut-off period of 128 s to remove low drift frequencies from the time series. Serial correlations were estimated with a restricted maximum likelihood (ReML) algorithm using an intrinsic autoregressive model during parameter estimation. Effects of interests were then tested by linear contrasts (e.g., CSLM \u2013 still, Speech AV \u2013 still, CSLM vs. Speech AV, etc.), generating statistical parametric maps [SPM(T)]. \n\nIndividual summary statistic images were further spatially smoothed (6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel) and entered in a second-level analysis in which participants were treated as a RFX. At this second level, one-sample   t  -tests were used to assess the contrasts between two conditions in the CS and NH groups separately. Two-sample   t  -tests were used for a direct comparison of the same contrasts between CS and NH participants. Additionally, conjunction null analyses ( ;  ) were used to identify the brain areas commonly activated between conditions or between CS and NH groups in contrasts of interest. This method tests whether individual effects are jointly significant, under the null hypothesis that all-but-one of the effects are significant, hence an \u201cAND\u201d over several individual hypotheses. ReML estimates of variance components were used to allow possible departure from the sphericity assumptions in RFX conjunction analyses ( ). \n\nIn order to explore the role of MT/V5 region to the experimental conditions (see below, p 21), psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses ( ;  ) were computed to test the hypothesis that experimental conditions modulate functional connectivity between neural activity in left or right MT/V5 areas and other brain regions involved in CS and AV processing. First, the time course of activity within MT/V5 area was extracted separately at left and right MT/V5 coordinates for each individual. To do so, the CSLM (respectively speech AV) vs. still contrast effect (corresponding to the summary statistic images entered in the RFX analysis) was computed at the individual level, and the local maximum of activation determined in a volume within the probabilistic map of MT/V5, as identified in a previous cytoarchitectonic analysis ( ). This peak value was selected, unless it was identified outside of the brain structure of interest upon visual inspection of the individual normalized anatomical T1 image and verification of localization in SPM toolbox Anatomy atlas ( ), in which case the maximum value that fitted the anatomical location was selected. Second, a new linear model was generated for each individual level, using three regressors. One regressor represented the task condition (CSLM [respectively speech AV] vs. still). The second regressor was the average activity in a sphere (radius 4 mm) centered on the coordinate of the participant-specific peak value. The third regressor represented the interaction of interest between the first (psychological) and the second (physiological) regressor. To build this regressor, the underlying neuronal activity was first estimated by a parametric empirical Bayes formulation, combined with the psychological factor (i.e., task condition) and subsequently convolved with the hemodynamic response function ( ). The design matrix also included the movement parameters caused by subject movements. A significant PPI indicated a change in the regression coefficients between any reported brain area and the reference region related to the task condition. Individual summary statistic images obtained at the first level (fixed effects) analysis were then spatially smoothed (6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel) and entered into a second-level (RFXs) analysis using one sample   t  -tests to test for condition-specific effects within CS or NH group separately. \n\nAdditionally, we performed an integration analysis, in which we searched for brain areas more strongly activated in a bi-articulatory condition (e.g., CSLM) than in the mono-articulatory conditions (e.g., CSM and CSL), during which only one of the two components was manipulated. This criterion of super-additivity ( ) was implemented as a t-contrast between the bi-articulatory condition and the sum of the two mono-articulatory conditions [e.g., CSLM > (CSM + CSL)]. For the CS group, the null hypothesis was thus a weighted contrast [2 -1 -1] such as [2 (mean activity during CSLM)] vs. [mean activity during CSM + mean activity during CSL]. For the NH group, the null hypothesis was [2 (mean activity during speech AV)] vs. [mean activity during speech auditory + mean activity during speech visual]. This comparison was masked inclusively by contrasts computed in the mono-articulatory conditions (e.g., CSM > still and CSL > still). This procedure indicated regions mainly devoted to integration while controlling for movement-related activity from manual cues and lipreading. This latter aspect is important since lip movements may have influenced activation results in simple subtraction analyses (e.g., CSLM-still). \n\nIn all of the analyses presented above, the resulting set of voxel values for each contrast constituted a map of the t-statistic [SPM(T)], at   p   < 0.001 threshold (uncorrected for multiple comparisons). Statistical inferences were then obtained after corrections at the voxel level using Gaussian random field theory ( ),   p  < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons in the whole brain volume, unless otherwise specified. \n\nAnatomical localization of local maxima and clusters was assessed with reference to the MNI space, using standard anatomical atlases ( ). MT/V5 is a functional area that was located using a probabilistic map in the Anatomy SPM Toolbox ( ;  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Data \n  \nThe target detection of the word \u201cpapa\u201d was accurate in both groups for all experimental conditions. In the CS group the mean performance was 100%, 99.1% (  SD   = 3.34) and 96.4% (  SD   = 5.8) in the CSLM, CSM and CSL conditions respectively. In the NH group, the mean performance was 100%, 95% (  SD   = 11.3) and 91% (  SD   = 19.5) in the speech AV, speech auditory and speech visual conditions respectively. The mean performance for the detection of the small circle in the control still task was 91% (  SD   = 12.9) in the CS group and 95% (  SD   = 11.7) in the NH group. The mean global performance was 98.5% in the deaf-CS group and 95.3% in the NH group. There was no significant difference between groups (  t   = 1.07; n.s.). \n\n\n### fMRI Data \n  \n#### Brain Activation during CS Processing: CSLM-Still (Deaf) \n  \nIn CS participants, CSLM perception elicited higher blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses than the control (still) condition bilaterally in the occipito-temporal junction including the MT/V5 area, and in the middle and superior temporal lobe with a more extended activation in the left than in the right hemisphere. The activation in the superior temporal lobe did not include the primary auditory cortex (Heschl\u2019s gyrus). Other areas activated within this contrast (CSLM-still) were the left inferior parietal lobe, the premotor area, and the inferior frontal gyrus,   pars triangularis   (BA 45). \n\n\n#### Brain Activation during Speech AV Processing: Speech AV-Still (Hearing) \n  \nIn NH participants, speech AV perception elicited greater BOLD responses than the control condition in bilateral superior and middle temporal gyri, including primary auditory cortex (Heschl\u2019s gyrus), as well as in bilateral inferior parietal lobe and left inferior frontal gyrus,   pars triangularis   (  Figure    and   Table   ). \n  \n Word perception in CSLM and speech AV.

Conjunction analysis between speech AV [speech AV \u2013 still] and CSLM [CSLM \u2013 still] perception of words   (top)  . Higher activations during CSLM perception of words [CSLM \u2013 still] compared to speech AV perception of words [speech AV \u2013 still]   (middle)   and during speech AV perception of words [speech AV \u2013 still] compared to CSLM perception of words [CSLM \u2013 still]   (bottom).   Conjunction analysis and CSLM > speech AV activations are displayed at   p   < 0.05 whole brain corrected while speech AV > CSLM is displayed at   p   < 0.001 uncorrected. All are superimposed on the SPM MRI template. CSLM, Cued Speech (oral + manual) in deaf early users; CSM, Cued Speech (manual only); AV, audiovisual speech in hearing speakers. \n    \nCommonalities (conjunction analysis) and differences (two sample   t  -test) between CSLM (CS group) and speech audiovisual (NH group) processing, related to   Figure   . \n    \n\n#### Differences in Brain Activation between CSLM and Speech AV Word Processing: A Two Sample   t  -test Analysis \n  \nIn comparing the speech AV and CSLM networks, we found greater BOLD responses in the CSLM (CS group) than in the speech AV (NH group) condition bilaterally in the occipito-temporal junction (MT/V5) and neighboring structures, with a greater extension in volume in the left hemisphere. Greater activations for speech AV than CSLM was found in the right middle temporal gyrus and the left superior temporal gyrus including Heschl\u2019s gyrus (  Figure    and   Table   ). \n\n\n#### Is MT/V5 Involved in Speech Processing? Psychophysiological Interaction Analysis (PPI) in MT/V5 for CSLM and Speech AV Word Processing \n  \nThe results shown above indicate that besides large commonalities, the neural basis of speech perception in CSLM in CS participants is shifted toward posterior regions of the brain as compared to speech AV in NH participants, with activation peaks in the occipito-temporal junction and MT/V5. Admittedly, activation in MT/V5 is associated with visual motion processing ( ;  ;  ), which was present in the CSLM but not in the control still condition. To test further whether activation in MT/V5 was associated specifically with processing of CSLM, a PPI analysis was performed with MT/V5 (left and right) as source area and CSLM vs. still condition as modulatory parameters. Results revealed increased connectivity during CSLM perception as compared to the still condition between the   left MT/V5   and temporal lobes in both hemispheres, as well as with the posterior inferior temporal and fusiform gyrus bilaterally (  Figure    and   Table   ). \n  \n MT/V5 Psychophysiological interactions in CSLM and speech AV.   Psychophysiological interactions (PPI) from the left   (top)   and right MT/V5   (bottom)   for deaf CS group (in green) and NH group (in red).   p   < 0.001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons. \n    \nPsychophysiological Interactions from left and right MT/V5 in NH and CS groups, related to   Figure   . \n    \nIncreased connectivity between left MT/V5 and temporal regions typically activated for speech processing suggests that left MT/V5 interacts with regions playing a role during CSLM perception.   Right MT/V5   was associated more strongly with CSLM in more posterior brain regions, including the middle occipital and fusiform gyri bilaterally, the left MT/V5 and superior parietal lobe, the right inferior occipital and posterior middle temporal gyri, and the right inferior parietal lobe. \n\nSimilar PPI analyses conducted in the NH group revealed a higher connectivity during speech AV than still condition between the left MT/V5 and a small left middle temporal region (  Figure    and   Table   ). \n\n\n#### Where Does Integration of Manual Cues and Lipreading in CSLM Take Place? Super-Additivity Analysis of Speech AV and CSLM Word Processing \n  \nWe performed analyses to identify the brain regions responding more strongly to bi-articulation (CSLM in the CS group; speech AV in the NH group) than to the sum of the mono-articulation stimulus presentation (e.g., CSM and CSL separately). The integration analysis in the NH group [speech AV \u2013 (speech auditory + speech visual)] revealed greater activity in the bilateral posterior superior and middle temporal gyri (  Figure    and   Table   ). This result is in agreement with findings from previous studies of spoken language that have shown that integration between lipreading and auditory speech takes place in the pSTS ( ;  ;  , but see  ). It is hypothesized that the particular sensitivity of this area for multimodal speech integration arises from a correlation between the dynamic aspects of   seen   lipreading and   heard   auditory speech ( ). \n  \n Neural basis of lipreading and auditory integration in AV hearing speakers.   Higher activations during speech auditory perception of words compared to the still control condition   (top)   and speech visual perception of words (lipreading) compared to the still control condition   (middle)   in AV hearing French speakers. Integration analysis of speech auditory and speech visual (lipreading) in speech AV: higher activations during speech AV [speech AV \u2013 still] compared to the sum of [speech A \u2013 still] and [speech visual \u2013 still]   (bottom)  , masked by contrasts of the uni-articulatory conditions (speech A > still and speech visual > still) in speech AV hearing French speakers. AV, audiovisual speech in hearing speakers; A, auditory;   p   < 0.05 whole brain corrected. \n    \nBrain activation during processing of auditory condition, lipreading condition and integration in NH group, related to   Figure   . \n    \nIn the CS group, the integration analysis [i.e., CSLM \u2265 (CSM + CSL)] revealed a supplementary activation in the left occipito-temporal junction only, around the MT/V5 area (  Figure    and   Table   ). This is the same location as the activation peak in the CSLM \u2265 still condition (see   Figure    and   Table   ). This finding further suggests that the left occipito-temporal junction, including MT/V5, supports the integration of lipread and manual speech features, above a mere visual processing of motion input. \n  \n Neural basis of lipreading and manual cue integration in deaf CS group.   Higher activations during manual cue perception of words compared to the still control condition   (top)   and lipreading perception of words compared to the still control condition   (middle)   in deaf early users of CS. Integration analysis of CSM and CSL (lipreading) in CSLM: higher activations during CSLM [CSLM \u2013 still] compared to the sum of [CSM \u2013 still] and [CSL \u2013 still]   (bottom)   masked by contrasts of the uni-articulatory conditions (e.g., CSM > still and CSL > still) in deaf early users of CS.

Comparison of Two Conjunction Analyses Within CS: CSM \u2013 CSLM and CSL \u2013 CSLM \n  \nFinally, we wondered whether one source of information is more important in CSLM perception for deaf CS users, as for AV speech in hearing people. Indeed, the primary processing of information in speech AV decoding comes from the auditory source, whereas the contribution of visual speech to the final percept directly depends on the ambiguity of the auditory information ( ). In CSLM production, it has been demonstrated that the manual cues movement anticipates the lip movements, and that this anticipation is used by the CS-perceivers to reduce the uncertainty about the phonemes pronounced ( ,  ;  ). This suggests the possibility that manual cues are dominant in CSLM processing, while lipreading would have a (secondary) role associated to the disambiguation of the percept. \n\nA conjunction analysis between CSLM and the CSM conditions was performed and revealed widely overlapping neural activity, especially in the bilateral occipito-temporal junction, the left superior and middle temporal and inferior parietal lobes (  Figure    and   Table   ). \n  \n Commonalities and differences within deaf group between lipreading and manual cues conditions.

Conversely, the conjunction analysis between CSLM and CSL conditions revealed a low overlap with only 25% of the CSLM network activated (mostly in the left middle temporal gyrus). Although this observation of higher overlap with the CSLM network was made at the descriptive level only, these conclusions are reinforced by subtraction analyses that failed to reveal significant differences between CSLM and CSM conditions, whereas extended, higher activation in the CSLM than in the CSL condition was found in the bilateral occipito-temporal junction. The great overlapping activity of CSLM and CSM might be linked to the common kinematic signature created by the movements in hands. However, our results may also suggest that the processing of manual cues might play a primary (dominant) role in CSLM decoding, while lipreading may play a second role. This makes CSLM even more akin to speech AV processing : similar analyses computed in the NH group revealed a high similarity between processing of speech AV and speech auditory conditions (68% overlap), but not between speech AV and lipreading (10% overlap), and subtractions showed larger differences between speech AV and lipreading conditions (  Figure    and   Table   ). \n  \n Commonalities and differences within hearing group between lipreading and auditory conditions.

Both groups of participants had French as their native language. Our study is the first neuroimaging investigation of deaf people who had full sensory access to the phonemic and syllabic content of spoken speech, through the visual modality. \n\nOur first research question concerned the similarities and differences between the processing of CSLM by early CS-users and the processing of speech AV speech by hearing participants. Our results show that the perception of oral language delivered through CSLM activates secondary auditory cortices in the MTG and STG together with IPL. This activation represents most of the overlapping activation regions found during CSLM and AV speech processing (see   Figure    and   Table   ). In AV speech processing, MTG and STG are parts of a structure in the auditory ventral stream ( ) that serves as an interface between sound based representations of speech ( ), visual speech (see   for a review) and widely distributed conceptual representations ( ). However, in CSLM, activity in MTG and STG cannot be linked to any kind of acoustic processing. Since earlier studies showed a very accurate CS perception and comprehension in deaf early CS users ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), activation of the secondary auditory cortex might be linked to an interface between phonetic visual speech codes conveyed by lip movements/manual cues and conceptual representations. \n\nDifferences in brain activation between CSLM and AV speech showed that the neural basis of speech perception in CSLM is shifted toward posterior regions of the brain (parieto-occipital regions) as compared to AV. Some studies have reported more posterior language processing in less experienced language users, deaf ( ) and not deaf ( ;  ). However, our CS participants were exposed to visual representation of spoken language as their native language. Our deaf participants had all a good level of comprehension of CS (see participants). This suggests that activations presented here are not the consequence of poor language processing. \n\nInterestingly, the common component of the speech AV and CSLM brain networks is located in the posterior portion of the STG. In contrast, the anterior part of STG (including the auditory primary cortex) is   only   activated in AV speech processing (see   Figure    and   Table   ). We surmise here a functional subdivision of the superior temporal lobe for speech processing, with the anterior part supporting speech processing based on sounds (i.e., phonetic codes), and the posterior portion involved in speech processing integrating information provided by different modalities (visual, auditory, and even somatosensory). Indeed, previous studies have shown that the multisensory posterior STG can be involved either in acoustic-phonetic processing ( ), in phonological mediation for lipreading ( ) or in simultaneous auditory-tactile stimulation ( ). Moreover, activation of STG also appeared during SL processing in deaf people suggesting that neural activity in posterior STG is linked to linguistic processing beyond auditory representation ( ;  ;  ). The present findings also indicate that the multisensory posterior STG could be activated by the processing of language cues   within a single modality   (here: visual), at least when these visual cues provide meaning for the individual as it was the case with the words presented in this experiment. Given previous findings showing that the posterior STG is activated when participants observe symbolic gestures ( ), our data support the hypothesis that this region responds to meaningful manual-lipread stimuli in deaf CS-users as well as vocal-auditory stimuli in hearing AV participants. Our results thus provide converging evidence with these previous neuroimaging studies, but also add the new information about involvement of posterior STG in the processing of CSLM. Finally, there is a greater activation of occipital gyrus in CSLM compared to AV. This might reflect the greater kinematic information supplied by the hands and lip movement in CS. \n\nIt should be noted that activation in posterior STG during CSLM processing could also be explained by the fact that our CS participants were all deaf. These two interpretations are not easy to disentangle.   showed that cortical plasticity resulting from deafness depends on language experience for auditory and visual areas. If normally hearing participants who are CS-users (parents, teachers, educators of deaf CS-users) also showed activation of posterior STS, the hypothesis that multi-signal integration inside the visual modality occurs in this region of the brain would be reinforced. \n\nOur second research question concerned the neural basis of integration of manual cues and lipread information. In CSLM, the integration is mandatory and concerns two types of dynamic information in the visual modality (i.e., visible movement of the labial and manual articulators). In contrast, in AV speech, integration concerns information in two different modalities: auditory and visual. Our integration analysis suggests that left MT/V5 plays a role in the integration of lipread and manual CS information. Note that this region has been already linked to speech processing ( ;  ) and to processing of visual movements in SL ( ). In addition, it has been shown that use of a visuospatial language like SL impacts the recruitment of the MT/V5 during motion visual processing. Deaf and hearing signers show a greater activation of the left MT/V5 than the right, while hearing non-signers show the opposite pattern ( ;  ), indicating that lateralization of MT/V5 is sensitive to language experience. Given that speech input in CS is primarily perceived through visual occipital networks, one may surmise that integration in the MT/V5 area is an early step in CSLM processing. This conception seems logical considering that manual cues and lips cues need to be processed before unambiguous decoding of speech ( ). Importantly, our integration analysis, unlike the other analyses (e.g., subtractions) conducted in this study, controls for perception of movements related to CS production, since the comparison is made between CSLM and the sum of manual cues and lipreading. However, we cannot firmly conclude that integration occurring in MT/V5 is   linguistic   because some (or even all) of this integration might be non-linguistic, or even attentional ( ). To support the hypothesis of a linguistic integration in MT/V5, future studies should compare these activation patterns with those coming from a control group that does not use or understand CS, presented with the same set of stimuli. In relation to the role of MT/V5 during CSLM perception, our PPI analyses yielded increased connectivity between left MT/V5 and speech processing regions located in the left temporal lobe. This suggests a cooperative activity between these areas in the treatment of CS components. \n\nIn addition, PPI analysis showed a functional inter-hemispheric differentiation in CS users: left MT/V5 interacts with left temporal lobes linked to speech processing whereas right MT/V5 interacts mostly with occipital areas, including left MT/V5, linked to visual perception and motion processing. \n\nOur third research question concerned the relative activation created by CSM and by CSL compared to the activation created by CSLM. If the manual cues play a leading role in the processing of CSLM, one could expect a greater overlap between the activation created by the CSM and CS conditions, compared to a lower overlap between the activation created by CSL and CSLM. The conjunction analyses between CSLM and CSM conditions, on the one hand, and CSLM and CSL conditions on the other hand may be associated to a dominant role for the manual cues. Indeed, the almost complete overlap between CSLM and CSM networks is compatible with the view that the manual cues first provide phonological information, and lipreading intervenes subsequently in order to further disambiguate the linguistic message. This conclusion is in good agreement with three types of behavioral data. First, temporal analyses of CS production have shown that manual cues are produced temporally in advance to the lips ( ,  ;  ). Second, when lipreading and manual cues are incongruent (e.g., pronouncing with the lips the phoneme /v/ with handshape 1 coding /d/, /p/ /j/ phonemes), most of the answers from the perceiver are related to the manual cues and not to lipreading, especially when the participant is an early CS user ( ;  ,  ). Third, deaf people who are early CS-users often succeed in daily natural communication with other CS users by producing manual cues alone, without lipreading. In this case, the full meaning of the message would be completed by the context ( ). While the set of manual cues was initially originally created with the aim of disambiguating lipreading ( ), the present data support the hypothesis that   it is lipreading which disambiguates manual cues  , thus presenting a   topsy-turvy   vision of CS ( ). One possible reason for this phenomenon is that in speech processing the perceiver takes a \u201cpreference\u201d for decoding from those elements that are perceptually most distinguishable (i.e., the manual cues in CS for deaf participants or audio in AV for hearing participants). In case of deaf CS perceivers, it must also kept in mind that manual CS cues are executed and visually available to the perceiver a very short time before lip movements ( ). At this step one could not also exclude that prior hand cues may reduce ambiguity before mouth shapes processing. \n\nInterestingly, manual cues were associated with increased activity in left superior and middle temporal gyrus (  Figure    and   Table   ), a brain zone typically activated during the processing of natural languages like spoken languages and signed languages. However, manual cues are completely artificial gestures, not resulting from any evolutionary process. This suggests that invented manual gestures that convey linguistic information may become processed in the same areas as other articulatory gestures previously integrated in the human language through the natural evolutionary process of communication. \n\nThese findings should be investigated in further studies to better understand the degree of dependency of language processing on speech features. For example, in order to better determine the brain areas subtending speech processing, one could conduct a similar study of speech perception, which would use a control condition containing pseudospeech movements through manual cues and lips, instead of a still control condition. The pseudospeech would be phonologically plausible but meaningless. This condition would enable us to dissociate brain areas linked to phonological processing from those linked to lexical processing in visual CS. Another interesting study would be to investigate the neural correlates of incongruent lip and manual cue movements (for example, a mouthed syllable /va/ accompanied by handshape 1 [/p, d, j/]), i.e., a McGurk-like effect experiment ( ;  ,  ). In CS, this would increase our understanding of the integration of visual speech features in deaf participants. Finally, we are interested in examining how manual cues are integrated with AV speech in deaf people fitted with a cochlear implant ( ,  ). As mentioned, the articulatory movement of the hand precedes the mouth opening and the emission of sound and may therefore predict aspects of the lipread and the auditory signals, especially when the AV signal is ambiguous (e.g., visual /k/). The amount and nature of visual information extracted from the hand may initiate the speech-processing system, in which an abstract representation is activated through visual inputs, up to the point of explicitly registering auditory input. If this speculation appears to be correct, it means that processing of CS gestures could help deaf children fitted with a cochlear implant to discriminate, identify or interpret the new arriving sounds. Integration across modalities would allow the STG to help individuals with cochlear implants in discrimination, identification or interpreting the ambiguous auditory cues delivered by the cochlear implant. \n\nAt a more general level, our data about the neural processing of CS increase our general knowledge on how do deaf native users of CS process visual speech information. Compared to normally hearing individuals, deaf native users of spoken language have fewer areas of anatomical differences than do deaf native users of ASL ( ). The neural processes involved in CS and in AV speech seem, to a certain extent, also similar. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn this article, we report results from the first neuroimaging study of CS processing, a mode of communication in which the syllables and phonemes of a spoken language are conveyed solely through the visual modality in the absence of either speech or hearing. First, we found that activation patterns in the secondary auditory cortex (i.e., temporal lobes) in visual CS perception and speech AV perception confirm the existence of a common language brain system for spoken languages, regardless of the sensory input modality. Second, our PPI and integration analyses suggest that MT/V5, a region classically associated with visual motion processing, exerts an active influence on the integration of hands and mouth. However, based on our analysis, we cannot conclude that this integration is merely linguistic. Finally, findings from our study suggest that the manual cues may dominate in the speech perception of skilled CS. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nMA, PP, and JL worked in the conception of the research and the redaction of the manuscript.

The neural basis of this mental ability is unclear, especially for musicians capable of engaging in accurate and vivid musical imagery. Here, we created a visualization of an 8-minute symphony as a silent movie and used it as real-time cue for musicians to continuously imagine the music for repeated and synchronized sessions during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The activations and networks evoked by musical imagery were compared with those elicited by the subjects directly listening to the same music. Musical imagery and musical perception resulted in overlapping activations at the anterolateral belt and Wernicke\u2019s area, where the responses were correlated with the auditory features of the music. Whereas Wernicke\u2019s area interacted within the intrinsic auditory network during musical perception, it was involved in much more complex networks during musical imagery, showing positive correlations with the dorsal attention network and the motor-control network and negative correlations with the default-mode network. Our results highlight the important role of Wernicke\u2019s area in forming vivid musical imagery through bilateral and anti-correlated network interactions, challenging the conventional view of segregated and lateralized processing of music versus language. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMental imagery, including the experiences such as \u201cseeing in the mind\u2019s eye\u201d, or \u201chearing in the head\u201d, is a hallmark example of human cognitive abilities. It refers to quasi-perceptual mentation that resembles vivid perception in the absence of any external stimuli . Previous studies suggest that imagery and perception tasks involve overlapping cortical areas , which however may not code the same information  or engage in the same network interactions  during both tasks. To date, the neural coding and network bases of mental imagery remains largely unknown and has been a long-standing topic of active research . \n\nAmong various types of mental imagery, musical imagery may occur with surprisingly high accuracy . A famous example illustrating human capabilities in this arena was Ludwig van Beethoven; despite deafness in his later years, he continued composing and conducting great symphonies guided by his \u201cinner ear\u201d . Neurobiologically, functional neuroimaging studies suggest that musical imagery involves cortical areas within and beyond the auditory system , including the auditory belt areas , the association cortex , the prefrontal cortex , and the premotor and supplementary motor areas . Furthermore, it has become well established that such areas do not function in isolation, but interact in networks. In fact, the coordinated network interactions among these areas have been thought to underlie various aspects of musical imagery, e.g. auditory processing , sensorimotor coordination , memory retrieval , cognitive control , and emotion . Hence, musical imagery is a rich behavioral and cognitive context, for which characterizing the patterns and dynamics of cortical networks may help understand the interplay of seemingly segregated functional systems. \n\nTo probe network interactions, it is necessary to gather sufficient samples of neural responses during musical imagery so that the functional relationships among different regions can be reliably measured. To meet this need, a musical-imagery task ought to be complex and sustained for several minutes or longer, especially if brain activity is observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, designing an experiment with musical imagery for such a prolonged period is challenging, because imagery is subjective, internally-driven, and thus difficult to control or access. For this reason, prior studies have focused on simple and short imagery tasks  while treating the musical-imagery experience as a series of discrete events divided by periods of rest rather than as a continuous process. Although such studies have been useful for revealing activations with simple musical imagery, findings obtained from them cannot be used to conclusively state how activated regions interact to form functional networks or what information their responses represent during complex musical imagery. \n\nNonetheless, these limitations can be mitigated by using visual stimulation to guide musical imagery. Herholz   et al  . has used a karaoke-like visual display to cue subjects to imagine familiar songs for several seconds . Although this methodology has not been used for a longer period of imagery, adopting a similar idea to control sustained musical imagery by using music visualization  without lyrics may further dissociate music from language during imagery. Music visualization may enable musicians to vividly and repeatedly imagine a very complex music piece, such as a Beethoven symphony capable of arousing rich and dynamic emotion . Moreover, repeated measures of sustained musical imagery allow separation of imagery-evoked responses from ongoing activity, making it possible to disentangle the task-evoked functional networks and spontaneously emerging (i.e. task-unrelated) networks . \n\nIn this study, we aimed to map and compare both cortical activations and functional networks during musical imagery versus perception. Unlike prior studies, we used a silent music visualization to guide experienced musicians to repeatedly imagine an 8-minute symphony in the absence of external auditory input. The visualization served to inform subjects of the music content and control the timing for the subjects\u2019 imagery experience, to maximize subjects\u2019 ability to imagine the music in a similar way as they listened to it. The fMRI data acquired with this paradigm were evaluated for intra-subject reproducibility and functional connectivity , to map cortical activations and functional networks under the sustained musical imagery paradigm or during the perception of musical stimulus. Moreover, we explored the information coded in the responses evoked by musical imagery and perception by correlating the fMRI signal with the time series of the auditory features of the music. Lastly, we compared imagery and perception-evoked functional networks with those in the resting state to explore the likely different patterns of network interactions during internally versus externally-driven mental processes. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Visually-cued musical imagery evoked wide-spread cortical activation \n  \nWhen a subject with musical training listened to an 8-min music piece eight times during the fMRI acquisition (Fig.\u00a0 , left), activated cortical areas were mapped by identifying the voxels with reproducible fMRI signals across repetitions. Activated voxels were mostly confined to the auditory cortex, including the core and belt regions along the ventral auditory pathway, and Wernicke\u2019s area (Fig.\u00a0 ); the activations were slightly stronger in the right hemisphere than the left hemisphere. Whereas this was unsurprising given the auditory nature of the musical-perception task, we further asked how the brain engaged cortical processes to support musical imagery in the absence of any auditory input.   \nDistinct and common cortical activations with musical perception and imagery. (  a  ) Paradigm for musical perception (left) and imagery (right). This music is in the public domain. The music score in (  a  ) was downloaded from http://www.free-scores.com/download-sheet-music.php?pdf=1220#. The visualized music shown in (  b  ) is an animation with bars moving from right to left as the music flows. It includes all the musical information as in a standard music sheet: the length of the bars indicates the note length (rhythm and duration); the height of the bars indicates the keynote (pitch); the color of the bars indicates the instrument (timbre). (  b  ) Cortical activations for musical perception (two-tailed significance level p\u2009<\u20090.01). (  c  ) Cortical activations for musical imagery (two-tailed significance level p\u2009<\u20090.005). (  d  ) Shared cortical substrates between musical perception and musical imagery (two-tailed significance level p\u2009<\u20090.01). The time series was extracted from the fMRI signal averaged across the perception or imagery sessions from the\u00a0labelled locations (AC: Auditory cortex; ALB: Auditory anterolateral belt; PMC: Premotor cortex; FEF: Frontal eye field; IPS: Intraparietal sulcus; SMA: Supplementary motor area). \n  \n\nTo address this question, we visualized the music as a silent movie (Fig.\u00a0 , right). This movie provided real-time visual cues to inform subjects of the content of musical imagery and assisted in controlling the timing of the imagery process during the 8-min session. By watching this movie, each subject could consistently imagine the music piece for 12 repeated sessions of fMRI scans. Similar to the activation analysis for musical perception, the cortical activation during the visually-cued musical imagery was mapped by assessing the intra-subject reproducibility of fMRI signals at the voxel level. The activated areas covered a large part of the cortex, including the primary visual cortex, dorsal visual areas, the parietal association cortex, the anterolateral belt, Wernicke\u2019s area, the frontal eye fields, the supplemental motor area and the premotor cortex (Fig.\u00a0 ). The responses at these areas could be attributable to either visual stimuli or musical imagery, since the task required the subject to process the visual cues as well as to imagine the music accordingly. \n\n\n### Musical imagery and perception shared common cortical substrates \n  \nWe further compared the task-evoked responses between the imagery and musical perception conditions. This allowed us to localize the responses to musical imagery as opposed to the visual stimuli because no visual stimuli were given during the perception condition. Since the anterolateral belt and Wernicke\u2019s area were activated by both tasks, they were likely the shared cortical substrates for both musical perception and imagery. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the fMRI signal correlation between each musical-imagery session and each music-perception session at each voxel. This analysis revealed the areas that showed consistent responses to both tasks (Fig.\u00a0 ). Such areas included Wernicke\u2019s area on the left hemisphere and its homologous area on the right hemisphere (herein we refer to them as the bilateral Wernicke\u2019s areas), and to a lesser degree the anterolateral belt, the supplementary motor areas, and the premotor cortex. Note that the perception task involved only auditory input but not visual input, whereas the imagery task involved only visual input but not auditory input. The voxel-wise correlation across these two task conditions was only attributable to the common music content in both conditions, regardless of whether it was actually presented or mentally recreated. As such, Fig.\u00a0  reports the cortical areas that underwent the same processing during sustained musical imagery and perception. By visual inspection of the averaged fMRI signals, we found that both the imagery and perception tasks evoked complex but similar responses bilaterally in Wernicke\u2019s areas, supplementary motor areas, and premotor cortex, over the entire duration of the music stimulus (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\nIn four additional sessions, we also presented the music with the same visual display as used in the musical-imagery task, yielding a control condition for us to validate findings from the intra-subject reproducibility analysis. As expected, the correlation in the fMRI signal between the (auditory-only) perception condition and the (auditory and visual) control condition revealed shared activations in the auditory cortex but not in the visual cortex (Supplementary Information, Fig.\u00a0 ). This was similar to the activations uncovered during auditory-only perception (Fig.\u00a0 ) as the subject listened to the same music in both conditions but only watched the visualization of the music in one condition. The correlation between the (visual-only) imagery condition and the (auditory and visual) control condition revealed shared activations at both the auditory and visual cortices (Supplementary Information Fig.\u00a0 ). The common activation in the visual cortex was expected because the visual stimuli drove reproducible responses at areas that processed the stimuli. However, the shared activations in Wernicke\u2019s area and the anterolateral belt further confirmed that these two areas were involved in both musical perception and imagery, despite the presence or absence of the visual display in the musical-perception condition. \n\n\n### Consistency and variation across subjects \n  \nAs shown in Fig.\u00a0 , the above findings observed in one subject were also reproduced in two other subjects with similar cultural and musical training backgrounds. In these subjects, the musical-imagery task was also repeated 12 times and the musical-perception task was repeated 8 times.   \nCortical activations with musical perception and imagery were consistent across all subjects. Each row indicates the cortical mapping for one subject. The first column shows the cortical activations for musical perception; the second column illustrates the cortical activations for musical imagery; the third column shows the shared cortical substrates between the two tasks. The first row (subject 1) depicts a flattened view of surface mapping as Fig.\u00a0  (  b  \u2013  d  ) (AC: Auditory cortex; ALB: Auditory anterolateral belt; PMC: Premotor cortex; FEF: Frontal eye field; IPS: Intraparietal sulcus; SMA: Supplementary motor area; V1: Primary visual cortex). \n  \n\nBeyond single-subject analysis in these three subjects, we also generalized the findings to a larger group of eight subjects who underwent fewer sessions (two under musical perception and two under musical imagery). Although the smaller amount of repetitions reduced the statistical power and the signal to noise ratio in each subject, the intra-subject correlations within and between perception and imagery sessions based on a set of regions of interest (ROIs) were averaged across subjects to reveal the group-level effects. In general, the group-level results revealed a similar set of activated regions as those obtained at the single subject levels (Figs\u00a0  and  ): the auditory core and belt areas, bilateral Wernicke\u2019s areas, and the left premotor cortex were activated during musical perception; while bilateral Wernicke\u2019s area, auditory anterolateral belts, premotor cortices, Intraparietal sulcus, left supplementary motor area and left frontal eye field were activated during musical imagery (Fig.\u00a0 ). The overall activations in left hemisphere are more consistent across all subjects than those in the right hemisphere. Particularly, the correlation between musical perception and imagery was most pronounced in Wernicke\u2019s area in the left hemisphere, suggesting that its role in musical imagery was most reliable and consistent across subjects.   \nDistinct and common cortical activations with musical perception and imagery from group-level analysis. Each chart reflects the averaged correlation (r value) among all subjects in different regions of interest (ROI) compared across three conditions: reproducibility between musical perception sessions (light gray); reproducibility between musical imagery sessions (black); correlation between a\u00a0musical perception session and a\u00a0musical imagery session (dark\u00a0gray). The left two charts show the\u00a0results for ROIs in the\u00a0left hemisphere and the right two charts show the\u00a0results for ROIs in\u00a0the right hemisphere. The mark * over a bar indicates that the specific ROI is consistently significantly activated by the musical perception or imagery task, or co-activated by both tasks among all subjects (two-tailed significance level p\u2009<\u20090.05). (A1: Primary auditory cortex; ALB: Auditory anterolateral belt; SMA: Supplementary motor area; PMC: Premotor cortex; FEF: Frontal eye field; IPS: Intraparietal sulcus). \n  \n\n\n### Responses at Wernicke\u2019s areas coded music-timbre features during musical imagery \n  \nWe further asked what musical information was preserved in the brain during musical imagery. To address this question, we explored a specific auditory feature known as the spectral flux. This feature measures how quickly the power spectrum of a sound wave changes over time , and it reflects the music timbre . As shown in Fig.\u00a0 , extracting the spectral flux from the music stimulus resulted in a time series that represented a timbre-related auditory feature in the music. After convolving the spectral flux with the hemodynamic response function (HRF) to produce its assumed signature in the fMRI signal, this feature time series was correlated to the real fMRI signal at each voxel during musical imagery. A finding consistent\u00a0across subjects was that the significantly correlated areas included ventral visual areas and Wernicke\u2019s areas in both hemispheres (Fig.\u00a0 , bottom). The former was not surprising since the visual cues changed according to the content of the music. The latter was interesting, because the Wernicke\u2019s area was not directly involved in visual processing. The correlation between the activity at Wernicke\u2019s area and the spectral-flux fluctuation implied that Wernicke\u2019s area represented auditory information during musical imagery, despite the absence of acoustic stimuli. During musical perception, the spectral-flux fluctuation was also correlated with the activity in Wernicke\u2019s areas, as well as in the core and belt areas in the auditory cortex (Fig.\u00a0 , top). Nevertheless, Wernicke\u2019s area was the only area that was correlated to the spectral-flux feature in both musical perception and musical imagery. Similar observations were obtained when a different musical feature was extracted from the amplitude envelope of the sound \u2013 another important feature for music timbre  (see Supplementary Information Fig.\u00a0 ). Taken together, these results suggest the auditory nature of neural coding in Wernicke\u2019s area during both musical perception and imagery.   \nResponses at Wernicke\u2019s areas coded musical features during imagery. (  a  ) The auditory spectral flux was extracted from the stimulus spectrogram as a feature showing how quickly the power spectrum of a sound wave changes over time. (  b  ) Spectral flux was highly correlated with the fMRI signals (averaged across\u00a0all subjects) in the common cortical regions shared between musical perception and imagery (corrected at false discovery rate (FDR) q\u2009<\u20090.05), especially in ventral visual areas and bilaterally in Wernicke\u2019s areas (as circled on the maps). \n  \n\n\n### Musical imagery and perception evoked highly distinctive cortical networks \n  \nWe also explored how the brain engaged its functional networks to support musical imagery and perception. For this purpose, we mapped and compared the task-evoked patterns of functional connectivity during the musical imagery versus during the music perception task. This analysis was based on seed-based inter-session functional connectivity , which isolates task-evoked responses that are reproducible and correlated across different sessions of the same task , becuase\u00a0spontaneous activity is independent of the task and thus uncorrelated across sessions. In this regard, four seed locations were chosen bilaterally from Wernicke\u2019s areas and anterolateral belts, because these areas were activated by both the musical imagery and perception tasks. Notably, the task-evoked patterns of seed-based functional connectivity were highly distinctive between the musical-perception task and the musical-imagery task (Fig.\u00a0 ). In contrast to the unimodal network involved in musical perception (Fig.\u00a0 , left), musical imagery recruited a much broader and more complex pattern of network interactions (Fig.\u00a0 , middle). During musical imagery, the four seed locations were positively correlated with the attention network (including the intraparietal sulcus and the frontal eye fields) and the motor-control network in the prefrontal cortex (including the supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex), but negatively correlated with the default-mode network (including the posterior cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobule, medial and lateral prefrontal cortices). Both the correlated and anti-correlated networks were largely symmetric between the two hemispheres. Although the network patterns appeared distinct between musical imagery and perception, the correlations between Wernicke\u2019s areas and the anterolateral belt cortex were noticeable in both of the tasks.   \nTask-evoked cortical network versus intrinsic network. The perception-evoked (first column) and imagery-evoked (second-column) cortical networks were mapped by cross-session seed-based correlation in the task-related fMRI signals. The third column is the intrinsic network mapped with\u00a0resting-state fMRI. Each row corresponds to one specific seed location (circled on the maps), labelled on the left. (AC: Auditory cortex; ALB: Auditory anterolateral belt; PMC: Premotor cortex; IPS: Intraparietal sulcus; SMA: Supplementary motor area; IPL: Inferior Parietal Lobule; DLPFC: Dorsal Lateral Prefrontal Cortex; VLPFC: Ventral Lateral Prefrontal Cortex). \n  \n\nWe further asked whether the patterns of network interactions during musical imagery or perception reflected the intrinsic functional connectivity during the resting state in the absence of any task. The resting state networks were consistent with the networks evoked by musical perception (Fig.\u00a0 , right). However, the networks evoked by musical imagery were not confined to any single intrinsic network; instead they involved complex interactions of multiple networks, including higher-order auditory networks, the attention network, the motor-control network, and the default-mode network. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we introduced a new experimental paradigm to map and compare cortical activations and networks in musicians during sustained and complex musical imagery versus during musical perception. During visually-cued musical imagery, subjects watched a movie and accordingly imagined a specific music piece. Wernicke\u2019s area and its homologous area in the right hemisphere facilitated the re-creation of the auditory features of the music, giving rise to vivid musical imagery resembling the experience of actually listening to music. Although Wernicke\u2019s area was involved in both musical imagery and perception, its interactions with other brain regions appeared to be highly different between these two conditions: musical imagery elicited much more widespread, complex, and multi-modal networks, whereas musical perception recruited intrinsic and unimodal networks. The most notable network signature of musical imagery was the anti-correlation between the default-model network and task positive networks for attention or motor control. \n\n### Music visualization facilitates repeated measures of sustained musical imagery \n  \nMental imagery is a subjective human experience that is hard to control and measure. Previous studies have mostly utilized experimental paradigms to acquire short periods of musical imagery alternating with other conditions, e.g. musical perception and resting state . Although such paradigms are convenient for mapping cortical activations with musical imagery, they do not allow repeated observations of brain activity during sustained musical imagery task such that patterns of task-evoked network interactions can be mapped. \n\nUnique to this study is the use of music visualization to control the timing and inform the content of complex and sustained musical imagery. The visualization uses a similar concept as Karaoke, enabling subjects to imagine the same music with a controlled tempo. This allows for repeated measures of the same imagery experience within and across subjects, so that the fMRI scans can be compared across sessions to map the imagery-evoked activations and networks, as previously demonstrated in studies for natural vision or hearing . Moreover, this stimulus paradigm also allows direct comparison of the fMRI signals between imagery and perception to map their shared cortical representations. \n\nIn addition to the purpose of mapping imagery-evoked activations and networks, this visually-cued imagery paradigm also offers a new opportunity to study neural coding for imagery. Many musical features can be predicted by decoding fMRI data from subjects listening to music ; however, it is very difficult to develop or evaluate methods for decoding musical imagery. In general, brain decoding methods require extensive data for training and testing decoding models . Such data are currently unavailable for mental imagery because the content of imagery is unsynchronized, complex, and inaccessible. Thus, it is desirable to experimentally control the imagery content to allow for synchronized and repeated brain activity measurements to generate data for rigorously training and testing decoding models, before attempting to apply them to more complex forms of imagery or cognitive processes, such as dreams . \n\n\n### Musical imagery involves bilateral Wernicke\u2019s areas \n  \nOur results suggest that two areas are essential to musical imagery: the anterolateral belt and Wernicke\u2019s area. As a part of the ventral auditory pathway, the anterolateral belt is likely involved in the recognition of the sound information during musical imagery. However, it was unexpected that Wernicke\u2019s areas were bilaterally activated with similar responses during musical imagery and perception (Fig.\u00a0 ). Wernicke\u2019s area is conventionally considered to be responsible for language processing and comprehension . However, the stimulus in this study was a recording of classical music without lyrics, and did not involve language per se. Therefore, the response in Wernicke\u2019s area was unlikely to reflect language processing during either musical imagery or processing. This finding led us to speculate the functional role of Wernicke\u2019s area beyond language . \n\nIn fact, music and language are both carried by sequential inputs with hierarchical syntactic structures . The syntax in language refers to the principles of grouping words into phrase, and phrases into sentence. Likewise, the syntax in music refers to the principles of combining tones into chords, and chords into harmony . Given their syntactic similarities, language and music processing might utilize a partly shared set of neural substrates . Among them, Wernicke\u2019s area is likely responsible for general syntax processing of sequences for language as well as music, as the information is represented through similarly hierarchical syntactic integration . \n\nIt is conventionally thought that music is processed by the right hemisphere, whereas speech is processed by the left hemisphere . However, such hemispheric specialization has been challenged by findings from recent functional imaging studies, which suggest involvement of both hemispheres in music perception . Our results support and extend this notion by further demonstrating that both hemispheres are involved in not only musical perception but also in musical imagery. It also turns out that music processing activates the networks rather symmetrically in both hemispheres. Future studies are desirable to explore the potentially distinctive roles of the left and right hemispheres during musical imagery. \n\n\n### Wernicke\u2019s area encodes music timbre information during musical imagery \n  \nIn this study, the response in Wernicke\u2019s area was highly correlated with music timbre features of the stimulus as imagined or heard (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Information Fig.\u00a0 ). This observation offers insights about the previously undiscovered function of Wernicke\u2019s area. At least in musicians, Wernicke\u2019s area may encode musical information, whether it is internally generated (imagery) or externally stimulated (perception), beyond its known function in language comprehension . \n\nThe musical information represented by the activity of Wernicke\u2019s area reflected low level features of the sound, such as spectral or amplitude fluctuations. During musical imagery, the sound was not present; therefore, the mentally-generated acoustic features were likely driven through top-down processes, as opposed to bottom-up processes that occurred when the sound was physically presented. In this context, the top-down and bottom-up processes involved distinct areas and networks. When the music was presented externally as a sound wave, its processing involved the primary auditory cortex and the ventral auditory pathway. In contrast, when the music was imagined in mind, the primary auditory cortex was not involved in representing the music (Fig.\u00a0 ). This distinction suggests that the primary auditory cortex encodes the auditory features of a music only when it is perceived and not when it is imagined . \n\n\n### Musical imagery requires complex interactions among multiple intrinsic networks \n  \nAlthough Wernicke\u2019s area encoded auditory features of music for both musical imagery and musical perception, its functional connectivity appeared largely different in these two conditions (Fig.\u00a0 ). In the musical perception task, Wernicke\u2019s area interacted with the auditory cortices bilaterally, showing a pattern of task-evoked functional connectivity consistent with the\u00a0intrinsic functional network in the resting state. However, during musical imagery, Wernicke\u2019s area engaged itself in a more complex pattern of functional connectivity, which included a subset of the auditory network, the attention network, and the default-mode network. \n\nThis finding is intuitively reasonable, as musical perception is a more natural and less demanding task than musical imagery. The high attention demand during musical imagery explains the positive interaction between Wernicke\u2019s area and the attention network . It also explains the negative interaction with the default-mode network, which tends to be deactivated by attention-demanding tasks  and anti-correlated with task-positive networks at rest . Moreover, the auditory network evoked by musical imagery did not cover the whole auditory cortex; it only included Wernicke\u2019s area and the anterolateral belt, and excluded the primary auditory cortex. This musical-imagery evoked network was notably different from the intrinsic auditory network observed in the resting state and from the task-evoked auditory network during musical perception. The absence of the primary auditory cortex in musical-imagery evoked network is consistent with findings from majority of the previous studies , but not Kraemer   et al  . , though this topic remains under debate. \n\nMoreover, our results demonstrate that task-evoked functional networks may differ from intrinsic functional networks in the resting state, despite a general correspondence between them . A task-evoked network may segregate up an intrinsic network to involve a subset of regions, or it may recruit multiple intrinsic networks through network-network interactions. The degree to which a task-evoked network corresponds to its intrinsic mode may directly depend on how natural and frequent a type of tasks occur in realistic experiences (listening to music is more naturalistic than imagining music) or may inversely depend on the cognitive load of the task. \n\n\n### Supplementary and premotor motor areas are involved in musical imagery \n  \nIn this study, the supplementary motor areas and the premotor cortex were activated during musical imagery, confirming findings in previous studies . Since the musical-imagery task did not involve any movement and all subjects reported no humming or other vocalizations, the activations of these motor-related areas were unlikely to be attributed to movements, but resulted from the mental imagery state. In line with this interpretation, the supplementary motor areas and the premotor cortex were activated with imagery, whereas the primary motor cortex was not. However, we did not explicitly monitor vocal or sub-vocal movement (e.g. with EMG recordings), and thus could not entirely exclude the possibility of all kinds of vocalization. \n\nSensory and motor experiences are often linked to one another . When playing an instrument, a musician reads music scores and controls fine motor movements to produce sound; the sound provides feedback for the musician to refine motor control . Such sensorimotor interactions might also occur during musical imagery, involving a motor-control circuit in the prefrontal cortex, including supplementary motor and premotor areas. The motor-control network activated with musical imagery (Fig.\u00a0 ) appears to be similar to the network activated with motor imagery . Thus, it is plausible that motor imagery (subvocal silent singing of notes or imagery of finger movements during music performing) may occur during musical imagery in musicians, or even during non-musical auditory imagery . \n\n\n### Musicians versus non-musicians \n  \nMusical imagery is not unique to musicians, and it is a common human experience that may even occur involuntarily to most people . However, research on musical imagery has often tested musicians and non-musicians in separate studies, since musical-imagery tasks for musicians may be too difficult for non-musicians to complete . For example, musicians are able to mentally imagine the temporal reversal of familiar melodies , which is hardly possible for non-musicians. Likewise, the imagery task based on music visualization is also very difficult for non-musicians to perform, limiting the scope of this study to musicians with a long history of musical training. \n\nMusicians and non-musicians may process and understand musical information in distinctive ways. For musicians, \u201creading the visualized music\u201d or \u201chearing the music\u201d might involve similar cognitive processes as reading and processing the musical note \u2013 the \u201clanguage\u201d specialized to music as a result of their musical training and knowledge. Musicians may also generate vivid imagery during silent reading of music scores, namely \u201cnotational audiation\u201d. Previous studies have shown that this specific type of musical imagery may trigger both auditory and motor imagery in musicians . The motor imagery may come from the subvocal silent singing of notes, or the manual motor imagery of performing instruments. In this study, we used a similar paradigm as \u201cnotational audiation\u201d, except that our visualization of music was more intuitive and better controlled in timing. All subjects in this study were musicians with a long history of musical training or practice. They all reported experiencing vivid musical imagery during experiments, and could imagine the music with accurate tempo and pitch in mind. Some even reported being able to imagine the instruments being played during mental imagery of the Beethoven symphony. The visually-cued imagery task in this study may also elicit the engagement of sensorimotor interactions and even motor imagery (as discussed in previous section). \n\nMusicians often outperform non-musicians not only during musical imagery tasks  but also during non-musical auditory imagery tasks . Previous functional neuroimaging study found enlarged auditory cortical representation in musicians, and the enlargement of tonotopic maps was correlated with their ages of starting musical training . Our results also suggest that both musical imagery and perception evoke bilateral activations and networks in musicians. Recent evidence suggests that this breakdown of lateralization is more likely to be observed in musicians . Since all participants in this study were trained musicians, we could not contrast our observations in musicians against non-musicians. As a result, we speculate, but do not assert, any causal relationship between musical training and imagery ability. \n\n\n\n## Methods and Materials \n  \n### Subjects and Stimuli \n  \nNine healthy volunteers (Age 19\u201327, 3 females, all right-handed with normal hearing and on average 10.9 years of musical training; see Table\u00a0  for subject details) participated in the study with informed written consent obtained from each subject according to a research protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board at Purdue University. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations as described in this approved protocol. Here, we focused on musicians because the task of imagining a long piece of classic music (elaborated as below) was rather difficult for non-musicians. Otherwise, inclusion of data from any subjects who were unable to perform the musical-imagery task would complicate the study, of which the main goal was to map cortical activations and networks underlying musical imagery. For this reason, any findings from this study were specifically confined to musicians with a long-term musical training.   \nSubject information. This table shows the information of all 9 subjects regarding their gender, age, handedness and musical training experience. \n  \n\nAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a0  (left), the auditory stimulus was the first 8\u2009minutes of the first movement of Beethoven\u2019s Symphony 9 (sampling rate: 11025\u2009Hz), delivered through binaural MR-compatible headphones (Silent Scan Audio Systems, Avotec, Stuart, FL). This music piece was visualized as a movie through Stephen Malinowski\u2019s Music Animation Machine . The visualization is a graphic music score based on the design of a 2-dimension piano roll. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a0  (right), it is an animation with rectangular bars moving from right to left as the music flows; the current note is the highlighted bar in the middle of the screen. Each subject imagined the music while watching the movie visualizing music. The movie offered real-time visual cues to control the timing and inform the content of musical imagery. The visualized music was delivered through a binocular goggle system (NordicNeuroLab Visual System, Bergen, Norway) using Psychophysics Toolbox 3 ( ). \n\nPrior to fMRI, each subject was trained for 1 to 2\u2009hours, to become familiar with the music visualization and imagery task. For the purposes of this study, 1 to 2\u2009hours of training was sufficient, as the visualization was intuitive for musicians . The subjects were instructed to report the vividness of their musical imagery based on a 1\u20135 scale (1 not at all; 5 very accurate). All subjects were able to vividly imagine the music, and self-reported 4.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 for the accuracy of pitches, 4.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 for the accuracy of tempo and 3.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9 for the accuracy of distinguishing different instruments. However, it should be noted that the above self-reporting by itself only provided subjective assessment of musical imagery, and could not be taken as fully objective evidence for the existence and vividness of musical imagery. Despite its limitation, the self-reported scores still offered reasonable support for the presence of musical imagery. Also note that the self-reported scores were not used in the fMRI analysis. So, the (subjective) behavioral assessment and the imaging-based evidence were entirely independent of each other. \n\n\n### Experiment \n  \nIn the musical perception sessions, each subject was instructed to listen to this music with his or her eyes closed while no movie was presented. During the musical imagery sessions, each subject was instructed to imagine the music piece while watching the silent music visualization. Three subjects performed the musical-perception task eight times and the musical-imagery task twelve times. The perception and imagery session order was counterbalanced but not randomized across subjects. The sessions were conducted over a period of five days; two perception sessions and two imagery sessions in each of the first four days; four imagery sessions in the fifth day. The purpose of the high number of repetitions was to reliably examine the cortical activations and networks evoked by each task separately and shared by both tasks at the individual-subject level. This was especially desirable for the imagery task, which was cognitively demanding and likely involved complex cortical processes that were more variable across subjects than the perception task. The other six subjects underwent two repetitions of the perception task intermixed with two repetitions of the imagery tasks in a single day. Among these six subjects, one subject was excluded due to excessive head motion during fMRI scans. Despite the limited repetitions of the latter subjects, data from these subjects, as well as from two sessions of data arbitrarily chosen from the first three subjects, served the purpose of mapping cortical activations and networks during musical perception and imagery at the group level. \n\nEach of the first three subjects also underwent six sessions of resting-state fMRI on a different day. In each session, the subjects were instructed to rest for 8\u2009minutes with the eyes closed, without falling into sleep. Since the resting-state sessions were long separated (by days) from the tasks of musical perception or imagery, it was unlikely that the subjects were conditioned to \u201cplay the music in their heads\u201d with a similar temporal precision without any instruction by the researchers. \n\n\n### MRI Acquisition and Preprocessing \n  \nMRI data were acquired in a 3\u2009T MRI system (Signa HDx, General Electric Healthcare, Milwaukee) with a 16-channel receive-only phase-array surface coil (NOVA Medical, Wilmington). Structural MRI with T1 and T2-weighted contrast were both acquired with 1\u2009mm isotropic resolution. Functional MRI data were acquired using a single-shot, gradient-recalled echo-planar imaging sequence with 3.5\u2009mm isotropic spatial resolution and 2\u2009second temporal resolution (38 interleaved axial slices with 3.5\u2009mm thickness and 3.5\u2009\u00d7\u20093.5 mm  in-plane resolution, TR/TE\u2009=\u20092000/35ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200978\u00b0, field of view\u2009=\u200922\u2009\u00d7\u200922\u2009cm ). Each subject was scanned with fMRI for 26 sessions: 8 sessions during the musical perception task, 12 under the visually-cued musical imagery task, and 6 in the wakeful eyes-closed resting state. Each session was 8\u2009minutes in length. \n\nMRI/fMRI images were preprocessed using a similar pipeline as in the Human Connectome Project . Briefly, all fMRI images were corrected for slice timing and motion, aligned to structural images, normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, transformed onto individual cortical surfaces, and then co-registered based on myelin density and cortical folding patterns. Following this step, slow trends in the fMRI time series were corrected by regressing out a fourth-order polynomial function. Then fMRI data were temporally standardized (with a zero mean and unitary variance) and spatially smoothed by applying a 2-D Gaussian kernel of 2\u2009mm full width at half maximum. \n\n\n### Mapping cortical activations during musical perception or imagery \n  \nFor the three subjects who underwent the greater number of repetitions, we mapped cortical activations during musical perception and imagery. For each task, intra-subject reproducibility was calculated at voxel-level, as previously used for measuring the reliability of cortical activity during naturalistic stimulation elsewhere . This reproducibility was measured separately for each voxel as the temporal correlation between different sessions of the same task: 28 inter-session pairs among 8 sessions for the perception task and 66 inter-session pairs among 12 sessions for the imagery task. To handle the dependences among the different inter-session pairs for assessing statistical significance test, we applied a parametric statistical test to the intra-subject reproducibility based on linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling  implemented in AFNI ( ). Specifically, the Fisher-transformed inter-session correlation   z   is expressed in a crossed random-effects model, where   b   is the effect of interest, the average correlation across all inter-session pairs,   \u03b8   and   \u03b8   are the random effects associated with the   i  th and   j  th sessions, respectively,   \u03b5   is the residual term,   i, j  \u2009=\u20091, 2, \u2026, 8 (for perception), and i,   j  \u2009=\u20091, 2, \u2026, 12 (for imagery). Using this approach, we localized the brain areas significantly activated during musical perception (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and musical imagery (p\u2009<\u20090.005). See more details about the LME in a recent paper by Chen   et al  . . \n\nTo test this effect at the group level, we used data from the group of eight subjects, for whom each underwent two sessions of musical imagery and two sessions of musical perception from each subject. We defined regions of interest (ROI) based on the multi-modal parcellation of human cerebral cortex , namely primary auditory cortex (A1), auditory anterolateral belt (ALB), Wernicke\u2019s area, supplementary motor area(SMA), premotor cortex (PMC), frontal eye field (FEF), intraparietal sulcus (IPS) (see more details regarding the size and center location of each ROI in Table\u00a0 ). For each subject, the fMRI signals from the same session were first averaged within every ROI. Intra-subject reproducibility was evaluated for each ROI by correlating the averaged fMRI signals between repeated sessions of the same task and then converted to z scores. Then, the reproducibility was averaged across subjects, and evaluated for statistical significance using a one-sample t-test (p\u2009<\u20090.05). This analysis was done separately for the musical-imagery task and the musical-perception task.   \nROI information. This table shows the information including the name, size and center location of each ROI for group-level analyses (A1: Primary auditory cortex; ALB: Auditory anterolateral belt; SMA: Supplementary motor area; PMC: Premotor cortex; FEF: Frontal eye field; IPS: Intraparietal sulcus). Size refers to the number of voxels within each ROI. The vertex index of the\u00a0center voxel for each ROI is extracted from the\u00a0standard 32k vertex surface meshes of Human Connectome Project . We also used the anatomical xyz-coordinates (mm) in the MNI space to indicate the location of the center voxel in each ROI. \n  \n\n\n### Mapping the common activations between musical perception and imagery \n  \nFor each subject, we also mapped the cortical regions where the musical perception and imagery tasks evoked the same response. For this purpose, we calculated for each voxel\u2019s the temporal correlation between each perception session and each imagery session. As such, the cross-task correlation was measured for a total of 96 pairs of sessions given 8 perception sessions and 12 imagery sessions. The significance of cross-task correlation was evaluated for each subject, based on a crossed random-effects LME model , where   \u03ba   and   \u03bb   are the random effects are associated with the   i  th session of perception and the   j  th session of imagery, respectively,   i  \u2009=\u20091, 2, \u2026, 8, and   j  \u2009=\u20091, 2, \u2026, 12. From this approach, we located the brain areas in which activities were significantly shared between musical perception and musical imagery (p\u2009<\u20090.01). \n\nWe also performed the ROI-based group-level analysis on the eight additional subjects; for each subject,\u00a0 data were available\u00a0from two sessions of musical imagery and two sessions of musical perception. Using the method described in the previous sub-section, we evaluated the intra-subject correlation between musical imagery and perception for each ROI, converted the correlation coefficients\u00a0to z scores and then\u00a0averaged them\u00a0across subjects. The statistical significance for the\u00a0group-averaged effect was tested using a one-sample t-test (p\u2009<\u20090.05). \n\nFor one subject, we also mapped the cortical regions in which the (auditory-only) musical perception and (visual display only) imagery tasks evoked the similar responses during the control condition (perception with visual display). For this purpose, we calculated the temporal correlation in the voxel time series between 1) each perception and each control session at each voxel and 2) each imagery session and each control session at each voxel, in a similar manner as\u00a0how the mapping of the common activations between musical perception and imagery was performed. The significance of the cross-task correlation was evaluated for each subject using the crossed random-effects LME model  as\u00a0Eq. ( ). \n\n\n### Mapping the fMRI correlates to auditory feature time series \n  \nWe further explored the musical content coded in the fMRI response. For this purpose, the spectral flux and amplitude envelope of the music stimulus (in the auditory form) was extracted by the MIRtoolbox in Matlab . Both spectral flux and amplitude envelope are important sound features for music timbre. Spectral flux measures the change in the power spectrum of a signal, which is calculated as the 2-norm (also known as the Euclidean distance) between the normalized spectra from adjacent frames . The envelope shows the global outer shape of the signal, which can detect musical events such as notes. The feature frame size was set to 1\u2009second with a step size of 0.1\u2009second. The auditory feature time series were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) . The resulting time series were correlated with the fMRI signal at every voxel. For both the musical imagery and perception tasks, the correlation was calculated after the voxel time series was averaged across all the repeated sessions of the same task. A one-sample t test was applied to localize the brain areas that were significantly correlated with the auditory features during perception (corrected at false discovery rate (FDR) q\u2009<\u20090.05) and imagery (corrected at false discovery rate (FDR) q\u2009<\u20090.05). \n\n\n### Mapping task-evoked networks during musical perception and imagery \n  \nFor the three subjects in which a higher number repetitions were conducted, we mapped the task-evoked patterns of functional connectivity during both the musical perception and the imagery task using a seed-based inter-session correlation analysis . Specifically, the time series at a particular seed location was taken from one session; then, the seed time series was correlated with every voxel time series during a different session of the same task. Four seed locations were chosen: 1) in the left Wernicke\u2019s area, 2) in the right Wernicke\u2019s area, 3) in the left Auditory anterolateral belt, and 4) in the right Auditory anterolateral belt. These choices were based on activated regions for both musical perception and imagery, as highlighted in our results (Fig.\u00a0 ). The inter-session functional connectivity was evaluated for each pair of distinct sessions of the same task. The significance of inter-session functional connectivity was also evaluated using the LME method . See Eq. ( ). \n\nFor each subject, we further compared the task-evoked networks with intrinsic functional networks observed with resting-state fMRI. Seed-based correlations of the spontaneous activity were mapped in the same seed locations as mentioned above. Briefly, the voxel time series were concatenated across the six resting state sessions for each subject, and temporal correlations were calculated using the concatenated data. The statistical significance was evaluated using two-tailed one-sample t-tests (corrected at false discovery rate (FDR) q\u2009<\u20090.01). \n\n\n### Data availability \n  \nThe datasets generated under the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Here we investigated task-related neural alterations during working memory task (n-back) and intrinsic alterations during resting-state (rs) in postpartum women using functional MRI (fMRI). Behaviorally, postpartum women showed comparable working memory performances to the controls although there was a tendency of prolonged response time. fMRI analysis results showed hyper-activation in regions belong to the task positive network (TPN) during the task and hypo-rsfMRI values in the default mode network (DMN) regions during rest in postpartum women. Based on these results, we performed network connectivity analysis using nodes of the TPN and DMN. As a result, the DMN showed a tendency of decreased connectivity in postpartum women during the working memory process compared to the controls. Our results suggest that postpartum women might have functional alterations in the DMN, and that hyper-activation in the TPN during a task might be a compensatory mechanism to maintain working memory performance in postpartum women. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA large number of postpartum women frequently complain of memory decline that disturbs their daily activities . Thus, several studies have attempted to find empirical evidence of postpartum memory decline using various neuropsychological tests . Working memory has been examined in most of these studies, but the results have been very inconsistent, with some studies reporting significant working memory impairment , while others failing to find any deficiency . Although one meta-analysis tried to give a possible explanation for this disparity by showing that postpartum women are selectively impaired in tasks demanding relatively high cognitive loads on the executive component of working memory than the storage component of working memory , the reason behind these conflicting results is still under debate. As working memory processes play a fundamental role in higher cognitive functions , which affect the lives of postpartum women not only in their caregiving but also in their work, it is important to accurately identify changes occurring to working memory during the postpartum period. \n\nNeural response can be more sensitive than behavioral neurocognitive tests , but the underlying neural changes for postpartum working memory remain poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrated that the working memory process mainly involves a set of regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and inferior parietal lobule described as the fronto-parietal network or task-positive network (TPN) . On the other hand, there are regions anti-correlated with the TPN, which are known as the default mode network (DMN), and the relationship between these two networks is reported to play an important role in cognitive processing . Although the DMN was mostly characterized in task-free context and not considered to be involved in task processing, studies were eventually able to show that DMN connectivity during working memory tasks and even resting-state activation is significantly correlated with working memory task performance . Therefore, considering the importance of the TPN and DMN on working memory, we hypothesized that these two networks would reveal neural changes in postpartum women. \n\nOne of the most distinct characteristics of the postpartum period is the dramatic change in hormone levels after delivery: a sharp decrease of estrogen and progesterone levels after gradual increase during pregnancy . Estradiol levels have been reported to have a high correlation with working memory ability in healthy young women  and postmenopausal women . Given the association, we can postulate that low estradiol levels in postpartum women might affect their working memory change. However, little information is available to define the association between estradiol level and working memory performance in postpartum women . Thus, in this study, we also tried to examine the association between working memory ability and estradiol level. \n\nIn the present study, we aimed to investigate neural alterations of activity and connectivity in postpartum women during the working memory process. fMRI activation patterns during an n-back task were analyzed and compared between the postpartum group and controls who had no history of pregnancy. In order to examine intrinsically altered brain activity and connectivity which have not been well identified in postpartum women, we conducted three resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) analyses in a data-driven manner. We expected there would be some consistently altered areas present, especially in the working memory network regions for all three analyses. Using network nodes derived from the resting-state data, a network connectivity analysis was conducted within the nodes of the DMN and TPN during an n-back task, and the relationships between fMRI values, clinical data and working memory performance were assessed. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Participant characteristics \n  \nThe participants\u2019 demographic and clinical data are given in Table\u00a0 . The postpartum group reported more nocturnal awakenings than the control group (  P  \u2009<\u20090.001). They also complained of subjective cognitive decline more often compared to the control group (higher Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ) scores;   P  \u2009=\u20090.008), and had more severe depressive symptoms than the control group (high Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores;   P  \u2009=\u20090.043). The serum estradiol level of the postpartum group was more than two times lower than that of the control group (  P  \u2009=\u20090.007). Among the neuropsychological test results, the postpartum group showed poor performance only in the Digit Span Sequencing test which was designed to measure working memory performance (  P  \u2009=\u20090.031).   \nDemographic and clinical characteristics. \n  \nNormally distributed data are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviations; otherwise, data are expressed as medians with the interquartile range in parentheses. Abbreviations: BDI, Beck Depression Inventory; CFQ, Cognitive Failure Questionnaire; COWAT, Controlled Oral Word Association test; EPDS, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; 15-item K-BNT, 15-item Korean version of the modified Boston Naming Test; and TMT, Trail Making Test. \n  \n\n\n### N-back task performance \n  \nRepeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to investigate group differences (group: postpartum group vs. control group) in task performance for the n-back task with varying cognitive loads (task: 0-back vs. 1-back vs. 2-back). \n\nIn terms of main effect of group, there was no significant difference in both accuracy and reaction time (RT) between the two groups. The postpartum group only showed a tendency of overall increased RT irrespective of conditions compared to the control group (  F  (1, 49) = 3.63,   P  \u2009=\u20090.063; Table\u00a0 ). For the main effect of task, significant differences were observed in both accuracy and RT (Wilks\u2019 Lambda\u2009=\u20090.53,   F  (2,48) = 21,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 and Wilks\u2019 Lambda\u2009=\u20090.36,   F  (2,48) = 43,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). Post-hoc t-test analyses showed slower RT and decreased accuracy with increasing working memory load in the [2-back \u2013 0-back] contrast (RT:   t  (50) = 5.43,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001; Accuracy:   t  (50) = \u22123.48,   P  \u2009=\u20090.001) and the [2-back \u2013 1-back] contrast (RT:   t  (50) = 8.84,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001; Accuracy:   t  (50) = \u22126.39,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001) in all participants. However, this pattern was not observed with the [1-back \u2013 0-back] contrast. Considering that increased cognitive load usually entails impaired performance, we assumed that an appropriate cognitive load effect was not reflected in the [1-back \u2013 0-back] contrast. Therefore, only the [2-back \u2013 0-back] contrast and the [2-back \u2013 1-back] contrast were included in subsequent fMRI analyses.   \nBehavioral results of n-back task. \n  \nNormally distributed data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation; otherwise, data are expressed as medians with the interquartile range in parentheses. Abbreviations: RT, Response time. \n  \n\nThere was no interaction effect between group and task. Even after BDI, CFQ, and number of awakenings were included as covariates because they showed significant group differences, there were still no interaction effects between group and task on accuracy and RT of the n-back task. \n\nThere were also no significant correlations between performance on the Digit Span Sequencing test with the accuracy and RT of the n-back task. \n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \n#### n-back task-related activation analysis \n  \nWe first investigated the main effect of group on n-back task-related brain activation. Compared to the controls, the postpartum group showed increased activation in the bilateral dlPFC. There were no significant clusters showing decreased activation relative to the control group (Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ).   \nn-back task-based fMRI activation analysis results. (  A  ) Main effects revealed by 2 (group: PP vs. CTRL) x 3 (task: 0-back vs. 1-back vs. 2-back) full factorial analysis. There is no significant voxel in the [PP\u2009<\u2009CTRL] contrast. (  B  ) Interaction effects revealed by 2 (group: PP vs. CTRL) x 3 (task: 0-back vs. 1-back vs. 2-back) full factorial analysis. There is no significant voxel in the [PP\u2009<\u2009CTRL (2-back > 1-back)] contrast and the [PP\u2009<\u2009CTRL (2-back > 0-back)] contrast.

With increasing cognitive demands on the [2-back \u2013 0-back] contrast, the postpartum group showed increased activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula/putamen and middle occipital gyrus compared to the control group. For the [2-back \u2013 1-back] contrast, the ACC and insula/putamen showed identical activity patterns to the [2-back \u2013 0-back] contrast, with the peak coordinates of each cluster even being the same, but the middle occipital gyrus did not reach statistical significance in this contrast (Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). In addition, even when controlling for CFQ and BDI, and number of awakening which all showed significant group difference, identical regions including the ACC and insula/putamen still showed significant interaction effect (Supplementary information Fig.\u00a0 ). These results showed that neural regions known as the TPN, which includes the dlPFC, ACC and insula, show increased activation in the postpartum group relative to the control group even after controlling the effect of the depressive and subjective cognitive decline symptoms as well as sleep quality. \n\n\n#### Resting-state analysis \n  \nThree resting-state analyses assessed the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), and regional homogeneity (ReHo), which reflect the amplitude and connectivity of regional spontaneous neural signals, and consistently showed those values to be decreased in the DMN regions (Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). In the ALFF analysis, a group comparison between the postpartum and control groups revealed reduced ALFF in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) of the postpartum group, which are the main structures of the DMN (Fig.\u00a0 ). Increased ALFF values were observed in the cerebellum, occipital gyrus and precuneus of the postpartum group. The fALFF analysis also demonstrated decreased fALFF in the postpartum group in the DMN areas, including the mPFC, rTPJ and inferior temporal gyrus (Fig.\u00a0 ). Furthermore, the resulting mPFC cluster (43 voxels) overlapped with the ALFF results. The ReHo analysis showed decreased ReHo values in the postpartum group in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and rTPJ which also belong to the DMN (Fig.\u00a0 ). The PCC (22 voxels), rTPJ (43 voxels), and right superior parietal region (15 voxels) clusters in ReHo overlapped with the ALFF clusters. In addition, the middle temporal gyrus cluster in ReHo also overlapped with the corresponding cluster of fALFF (10 voxels). The cerebellum and insula/putamen showed increased ReHo values in the postpartum group.   \nResting-state fMRI analysis results.

Group comparisons of within-DMN, within-TPN and DMN-TPN connectivity only yielded a trend of reduced within-DMN connectivity in the postpartum group (  P  \u2009=\u20090.080). There was no significant difference in within-TPN connectivity and DMN-TPN inter-network coupling between the postpartum group and the control group (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nGroup differences in the within-TPN, within-DMN and DMN-TPN inter-network connectivity strengths during the n-back task. Abbreviations: CTRL, control group; PP, postpartum group. \n  \n\n\n#### Correlation analysis between estradiol level, working memory performance and network connectivity \n  \nA significant negative correlation was found between the serum estradiol level and overall RT (Spearman\u2019s   rho  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.304,   P  \u2009=\u20090.030). A negative correlation was significant in the control group (Spearman\u2019s   rho  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.402,   P  \u2009=\u20090.038), but not in the postpartum group (Spearman\u2019s   rho  \u2009=\u20090.007,   P  \u2009=\u20090.974; Fig.\u00a0 ). In order to check if the interaction between estradiol level and group significantly affected overall RT, we used the glm R function including group, estradiol level, and their interaction term group*estradiol level in the model. Group (reference\u2009=\u2009control group;   \u03b2  \u2009=\u20094.700; standard error [SE]\u2009=\u200920.979;   P  \u2009=\u20090.824), estradiol level (  \u03b2  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.153; SE\u2009=\u20090.088;   P  \u2009=\u20090.088), and interaction effect (  \u03b2  \u2009=\u20090.158; SE\u2009=\u20090.234;   P  \u2009=\u20090.503) did not have any significant effect on the overall RT.   \nCorrelation analysis between estradiol level and overall RT.

Gray matter volume did not decrease more in the control group compared with the postpartum group (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nVBM analysis result.

Although postpartum women showed comparable working memory performance to controls, they showed different neural activation. The postpartum group showed hyper-activity in TPN regions with increasing cognitive load during the working memory process, while showing hypo-activity in DMN regions during resting-state compared to the control group. A subsequent network connectivity analysis also implied possible alterations in the DMN during working memory task. Therefore, postpartum women might have functional alterations in DMN regions, and TPN regions might be hyper-activated to maintain working memory performance in postpartum women. \n\nAs some previous studies reported , the postpartum group did not show significant difference in performances for the n-back task compared to the controls in our study. However, the postpartum group showed a tendency of overall prolonged RT compared to the controls. As RT represents the speed of information processing, the prolonged RT of the postpartum group may reflect decreased speed in information processing. Decreased processing speed has been consistently reported in postpartum women . Although our postpartum group did not show significant reduction in processing speed during the task, slower processing speeds could be worse or more prominent in their daily life. In studies that investigated pregnant cognitive change, significant memory deficit was found in field tasks but not in laboratory tasks . It appears that pregnancy-related memory decline may be better detected when women face the actual competing demands of everyday life. RT was also prolonged as working memory load increased in our study. Therefore, we postulated that postpartum women felt the working memory task was more difficult than the controls did, with somewhat decreased ability to perform the task. \n\nAlthough there was no significant difference in working memory performance, the postpartum group showed more activation in TPN than the control group. The hyper-activation in TPN regions during cognitive tasks has been reported in patients with mild cognitive impairment who have shown comparable performance to controls, but not in those with significant cognitive decline in previous studies . The authors of these past studies suggested this finding as a compensatory process or inefficiency. Therefore, the hyper-activation of TPN regions in our postpartum group could also be interpreted in the same manner. In addition, the postpartum group showed reduced gray matter volume in the bilateral dlPFC, ACC, and pallidum which largely belong to the TPN in our study. Specifically, the dlPFC which showed gray matter volume loss partly overlapped with the areas hyper-activated during the n-back task in the postpartum group compared to the controls. This dlPFC volume loss was also reported with increased neural activity in corresponding areas in a previous study on postpartum women . These findings suggest that the dlPFC can be hyper-activated to make up for volume loss, and corroborates the existence of a compensatory mechanism in the TPN of postpartum women. \n\nThe postpartum group consistently showed DMN alterations in three different analyses during resting-state when no tasks were performed. It is presumed that resting-state brain organization reflects more fundamental and intrinsic neural properties than transient task-evoked neural signals . Moreover, a recent study found that the organization of the resting-state network shapes neural activation for cognitive tasks . This raises the possibility that DMN disruption might be an intrinsic change occurring during the postpartum period and that this change can lead to alterations in neural activation patterns during the task as well as behavioral performance. According to the previously-mentioned recent study , prolonged atrophy in regions which overlap with the DMN was found in postpartum women and lasted for more than two years after birth. Furthermore, those atrophic areas showed increased neural activity when the postpartum women saw pictures of their own babies compared to other infants, which suggests that the DMN is involved in the behavior which facilitates motherhood. Accordingly, underlying functional and structural alterations might be attributable to specific behavioral patterns of postpartum women, and we suggest the DMN as a core region for these alterations. \n\nAlthough the influence of estradiol on the specific types of cognitive abilities including working memory has been consistently reported , the exact mechanism has not been well established. According to some previous studies, estrogen might play a role as a mediator, inducing neural changes in several brain areas . In those studies, estrogen level was correlated with neural activation in the insula and postcentral gyrus in young healthy women  and in the prefrontal area in postmenopausal women  during working memory tasks. However, we could not find a significant relationship between estrogen and the activity as well as the network connectivity of DMN and TPN in our study. As the effect of estrogen on neural activation and subsequently, on cognitive function has not been well studied in postpartum women, associations between estrogen, neural index from activity and connectivity, and cognition have to be further elucidated in future studies. \n\nIn contrast to the fMRI values, prolonged RT was significantly correlated with lower serum levels of estradiol in our study, supporting the positive effect of estradiol on working memory function. However, the association was significant in the control group, while significance was not found in the postpartum group. The relatively narrow range of the low serum levels of estradiol in the postpartum group could be a possible explanation, at least in part, for the differential results. \n\nThere are some limitations of this study. First, since we mainly focused on the DMN and TPN, possible alterations in other cognitive networks during the postpartum period were not examined. Future studies may consider expanding the investigation to other networks, which can supplement our results. Second, motivation could be a significant factor affecting the attention on irrelevant stimuli, but was not assessed and controlled for in this study. Since women during the postpartum period usually engage in many new tasks, low motivation might lead to distraction by irrelevant stimuli. Thus, motivation itself can be a factor and needs to be corrected for in future studies. Third, the number of participants were small in our study, resulting in an inherent limitation when generalizing our results. However, this study was exploratory research that was focused on seeking neural substrates relevant to postpartum working memory change, which has not been investigated before, and its findings can help facilitate future studies in this research field. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis study examined neural alterations during working memory process and resting state in postpartum women. Even though postpartum women showed comparable working memory performance, there was decreased activity and connectivity in the DMN regions during resting state as well as the working memory process in postpartum women. Postpartum women also showed hyper-activation in the TPN regions during the working memory task, which might be due to a compensation mechanism to maintain working memory performance. Since neural correlates of postpartum cognitive change have not yet been sufficiently studied, our results might provide potential neural targets associated with postpartum working memory changes for future studies. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-five females in the 2  to 4  month after parturition (the postpartum group) with normal pregnancies, uncomplicated term vaginal or Caesarean deliveries, and healthy babies were recruited. Thirty-two age-matched, naturally cycling women who had never experienced pregnancy participated as controls in the experiment. All participants were right-handed and native Koreans with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Exclusion criteria included treatment with hormonal preparations, treatment with psychotropic drugs, medical, psychiatric, or neurological comorbidities that might be associated with cognitive dysfunction, and history of head trauma that resulted in loss of consciousness or concussion. This prospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Severence Hospital, ant all participants signed a written informed consent document after receiving a full explanation of the study protocol. The experiment was carried out in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki. In data analysis, five participants of the control group and one participant of the postpartum group were excluded for the following reasons: head movement exceeding the priori maximum of 3\u2009mm (n\u2009=\u20092), severe signal loss in the parietal lobe (n\u2009=\u20092), and an age 1.5 standard deviations below the mean age (n\u2009=\u20091). \n\n\n### Experimental overview \n  \nThe present experiment consisted of three sessions. In the pre-scan session, participants responded to questionnaires for demographic and clinical characteristics, and blood samples were collected for the estradiol assay. During the fMRI scanning session, participants underwent resting-state scanning and performed remember-know encoding task, n-back task, prospective memory task, remember-know retrieval task and empathy task. Then, 3 dimensional (3D) T1-weighted structural imaging was acquired. After scanning was complete, the neuropsychological test battery was conducted to assess cognitive function. We only reported the n-back task and resting-state data in this present study. \n\n\n### Self-report questionnaires \n  \nParticipants were asked to fill out questionnaires about demographic and clinical characteristics, number of nocturnal awakenings, total sleep time per day, and a 10-point scale to rate sleep deprivation in which 0 indicated no sleep deprivation and 10 severe deprivation. The questionnaires also included the BDI  and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)  to assess depressive symptoms, and the CFQ  to assess subjective cognitive decline. \n\n\n### Estradiol assays \n  \nAll blood samples were obtained by venipuncture from the antecubital space, and serum estradiol levels were estimated by an enzyme chemiluminescent immunoassay using a UniCel DxI 800 automated analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc, Fullerton, CA). The minimum sensitivity and range for estradiol levels was 20-4800\u2009pg/mL. \n\n\n### Neuropsychological tests \n  \nThe neuropsychological test battery included the forward, backward, and sequencing Digit Span subsets of the Korean version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (K-WAIS) to evaluate working memory , the TMT part A to evaluate speed of information processing , the semantic Controlled Oral Word Association test (COWAT) and Trail Making Test (TMT) part B to evaluate executive function/verbal fluency , the 15-item Korean version of the modified Boston Naming Test (K-BNT) to evaluate language function, the Word List Memory to evaluate verbal learning, and the Word List Recall and Recognition to evaluate verbal learning/memory function. \n\n\n### Working memory paradigm: the n-back task \n  \nThe current study employed a letter variant of the n-back task paradigm in which three n-back blocks ranging from 0-back to 2-back interleaved with four fixation blocks (F). The n-back blocks and fixation blocks were presented in fixed order ((F, 0-back, 1-back, 2-back) x 3, F), and each block lasted for 40\u2009s including 3\u2009s for the instruction page at the beginning of the block. In the 0-back block, participants were required to press a button with their right index finger on the appearance of the letter Z in a string of letters. For the 1-back and 2-back blocks, participants had to respond with the same button whenever the current letter was identical to the letter right before (1-back), or the letter two spaces before (2-back). Each n-back block was composed of four target trials and fifteen non-target trials. Letters in white font were presented serially in the center of the black screen for 1\u2009s with an inter-trial interval of 1\u2009s. During the fixation blocks, a central fixation cross was displayed, and participants were instructed to stare at the cross and relax. Accuracy was computed by calculating the percentage of correct answers to total answers. RT was measured in milliseconds from the presentation of each stimulus until participants pressed the button. Accuracy and RT were computed for each task condition and also for the overall task. \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nAll scans were acquired by using a 3\u2009T MR imaging unit (Discovery MR750; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) with an 8-channel head coil. Functional images were acquired with the following parameters for the gradient-echo single-shot echoplanar imaging (GE-SS-EPI) sequence: TR\u2009=\u20092000 ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009240 \u00d7 240 mm , voxel size = 3.75 \u00d7 3.75 \u00d7 4.0 mm , flip angle = 90\u00b0, 33 axial slices tilted 30\u00b0 from the AC\u2013PC plane, no gap, interleaved. rsfMRI data were collected and followed by five functional runs of volume acquisition. During the resting-state data scan which lasted for 6\u2009min 48\u2009sec, participants were instructed to close their eyes while lying awake, and not to think of anything in particular or in a systematic way. In functional runs, stimuli were projected onto a screen at the end of the scanner, and participants viewed stimuli through a mirror mounted on the head coil. Participants responded with a magnet-compatible button box. For structural image acquisition, we used 3D-T1-turbo field echo sequence with the following parameters: sagittal acquisition with TR\u2009=\u20098.3\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20093.3\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009198 \u00d7 220 mm , voxel size = 0.77 \u00d7 0.86 \u00d7 1.0 mm , 216 slices, flip angle = 12\u00b0, no gap. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \n#### Task fMRI analysis \n  \nPreprocessing and general linear model were conducted using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8 with MATLAB 2014a, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, U.K.). Slice-timing correction was conducted by resampling all slices relative to the middle slice (i.e., 17th slice) in temporal order. The fMRI data for each subject was realigned to the first volume for motion correction and only data sets with \u2264 2\u2009mm maximal displacement during an entire scan were included in this study. Next, the functional images were coregistered to the T1-weighted image and spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template provided with SPM8, then resampled into 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3\u2009mm size voxels, followed by spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 8\u2009mm. A high-pass filter of 1/128\u2009Hz was used to remove low-frequency noise, and temporal autocorrelation was done with an AR(1) + white noise model. \n\nThe general linear model (GLM) included 3 separate task regressors modeling activation during the 0-back, 1-back and 2-back blocks, and these regressors were convolved with canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). Six motion parameters acquired during realignment and a session mean regressor were also included in the design matrix. Three beta images representing BOLD activity during each condition were generated for each individual participant, and these images were entered into the group-level analysis. For the 2  level analysis, 2(groups) x 3(conditions) full factorial ANOVA were conducted. The between-group factor consisted of \u201cpostpartum\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d, and the within-group factor consisted of \u201c0-back\u201d, \u201c1-back\u201d and \u201c2-back\u201d. All statistical analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons based on Monte Carlo simulation corresponding to an alpha level of   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 . \n\n\n#### Resting-state fMRI analysis \n  \nAn independent resting-state analysis was conducted to investigate intrinsic alterations of the postpartum group which were not affected by task-related activity. We conducted amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) analyses to assess amplitude of intrinsic brain activity, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis to assess regional connectivity of intrinsic brain activity using the toolboxes of Data Processing Assistant for Resting-state fMRI (DPARSF version 2.3,  ). ALFF/fALFF analyses demonstrated low frequency amplitudes which reflect spontaneous activation during the resting state . In these analyses, data were preprocessed in an identical manner to that of the previous GLM analysis except that nuisance regression was excluded, and additional linear-trend removal and band-pass filtering (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz) were conducted. Then, the time series for each voxel was converted to the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The square root of the power spectrum was calculated and averaged across the low frequency range (0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz), yielding an ALFF value for each voxel. fALFF was obtained by computing the fraction of ALFF over the whole detectable frequency range for the given signal. The ALFF and fALFF maps of each participant were normalized to conduct the group-level two-sample t-test. ReHo analysis estimated voxel-based synchrony of time-series within a functional cluster during resting-state, which allowed us to examine regional functionality. The data were preprocessed with the same methods used in the ALFF/fALFF analysis, but smoothing was not performed in ReHo analysis to avoid inflating the results . Then, Kendall\u2019s coefficient of concordance (KCC) which represents regional similarity was calculated on the time series of a given voxel with those of its nearest 26 neighbors in a voxel-wise manner . The resulting ReHo maps were also normalized to reduce variability across participants and underwent a two-sample t-test. \n\nWe used these three different resting-state analyses to identify neural alterations consistently found in both amplitude and connectivity aspects in the postpartum group during resting-state. Details for the resting-state analysis are described in the Supplementary information. \n\n\n\n### Task-related network connectivity analysis \n  \n#### Network node selection \n  \nThe DMN and TPN node selection was performed in the rsfMRI. First, the previously reported posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) seed [\u22122 \u221251 27] (Talairach coordinates) was selected as   a priori   ROI to generate functional connectivity maps . The correlation coefficient map was constructed for each participant by calculating correlation between the time series of the 8\u2009mm sphere PCC mask and that of each remaining voxel in the whole brain. The z-transformed functional connectivity (FC) maps were then averaged to generate a group-level DMN map. As the TPN is defined as regions showing anti-correlation with the DMN , \u22121 weighted FC maps were used to create a TPN map. The nodes within each network were created as sufficiently large clusters (K\u2009>\u200968 voxels) after thresholding the DMN and TPN maps at Z\u2009>\u20090.35. Three clusters located in the cerebellum region were excluded from the DMN nodes, as considerable portions of the created clusters were positioned outside the brain. Six generated DMN nodes were located in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), PCC, bilateral medial temporal gyrus (lMTG, rMTG) and bilateral angular gyrus (lAG, rAG), and seven TPN nodes were located in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (ldlPFC, rdlPFC), bilateral anterior insula (laIns, raIns), and bilateral supramarginal gyrus (lSMG, rSMG) (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nSix DMN and seven TPN nodes for the network connectivity analysis were derived from the resting-state functional connectivity analysis. Abbreviations: ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; lAG, rAG, bilateral angular gyrus; laIns, raIns, bilateral anterior insula; ldlPFC, rdlPFC, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; lMTG, rMTG, bilateral medial temporal gyrus; lSMG, rSMG, bilateral supramarginal gyrus mPFC, medial prefrontal cortex; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex. \n  \n\n\n#### Calculation of task-related network functional connectivity \n  \nThe time series of each of the 13 nodes were extracted from preprocessed working memory task images (260 TR) for each participant. The time series of each voxel was detrended and normalized, and then averaged across voxels, yielding the time series of each node. Pair-wise cross correlation coefficients were calculated between each pair of the nodes by conducting a partial correlation, while controlling for motion artifacts, and the global mean and working memory load effect. Specifically, 3 cognitive load regressors for each condition (0-back, 1-back, 2-back) and 6 motion regressors that were convolved with HRF were regressed out. Then, the correlation coefficients were normalized by Fisher\u2019s Z transform to increase normality. For each participant, within-DMN connectivity was assessed by averaging the correlation coefficients of each pair within DMN nodes, and within-TPN connectivity was assessed by averaging the correlation coefficients of each pair within TPN nodes. Inter-network connectivity was calculated by averaging the correlation coefficients of each pair between the DMN and TPN nodes. In order to compare within- and inter-network patterns between the postpartum and control groups, we carried out a two-sample t-test using each participant\u2019s within-DMN, within-TPN, and inter-network connections. \n\n\n#### Voxel-based morphometry analysis \n  \nTo explore if there was any structural difference between the postpartum group and the control group and to find how the structural alterations were related to functional changes, we performed voxel-based morphometry analysis. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was conducted using SPM 12 (Wellcome Institute of Neurology, University College London, UK,  ). T1-weighted images were segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid by an image-intensity nonuniformity correction and a unified tissue-segmentation procedure. The segmented gray matter images were registered using a customized template by DARTEL algorithm (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience) and spatially normalized to standard MNI space. Then, the gray matter images were modulated using Jacobean determinants of the corresponding deformation filed for correcting volume changes. The resulting images were smoothed using an 8-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. \n\nThe two-sample t-test was performed on gray matter images for group-level analysis, and we used an uncorrected threshold of P\u2009<\u20090.001, k\u2009=\u2009100 for exploratory purposes. \n\n\n\n### Clinical data analysis \n  \nNormally distributed clinical data were compared between the postpartum and control groups with the two-sample   t  -test.

Resting-state functional MRI data were collected from 32 subjects: 16 healthy controls and 16 AD patients. All 16 AD patients underwent 6\u00a0months of donepezil treatment and received two MRI scans (pre- and post-intervention). Analysis of covariance and post hoc analyses were used to compare ReHo differences among the healthy controls, pre-intervention AD patients, and post-intervention AD patients. Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine relationships between ReHo values in differential brain regions and clinical symptoms. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCompared with healthy controls, post-intervention AD patients had reduced ReHo in the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus, and pre-intervention AD patients had reduced ReHo in the orbital part of the right inferior frontal gyrus. Pattern recognition models revealed that pre-intervention ReHo values in abnormal brain regions of AD patients were 76% accurate for predicting the efficacy of donepezil on cognitive function and 65% accurate for predicting its efficacy on depressive symptoms. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThese findings deepen our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying the clinical efficacy of donepezil in AD patients, and provide a novel way to predict its clinical efficacy in such patients. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDonepezil hydrochloride is currently the first-line drug for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is widely used in the clinic because of its effectiveness against cognitive dysfunction, low side effects, good compliance, and high efficacy and acceptability [ ]. Donepezil may improve cognitive function in patients with AD by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase [ ], which is involved in cell development and maturation and can promote neuronal development and nerve regeneration [ ]. However, the mechanisms by which donepezil modulates brain function in AD patients, and thus interferes with clinical symptoms, remain unclear. \n\nIn recent years, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to study the mechanisms of donepezil intervention in the AD brain [ \u2013 ]. An MRI-based structural imaging study revealed that donepezil slows the process of forebrain atrophy in AD patients compared with placebo [ ]. In contrast, after donepezil intervention, patients with mild cognitive impairment have increased putamen, globus pallidus, and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) gray matter volume, but decreased hippocampal volume [ ]. A resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) study demonstrated increased orbitofrontal network connectivity in AD patients after a 12-week intervention with donepezil; orbitofrontal network connectivity was associated with cognitive improvement [ ]. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) has also been used to study the mechanisms of donepezil intervention in the AD brain. Cheng et al. [ ] explored changes in ReHo after donepezil intervention in 11 AD patients, and reported decreased ReHo in the right gyrus rectus, right precentral gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus after the intervention. However, their analysis did not correct for multiple comparisons and the sample size was very small. \n\nThe aim of the present study was to use rsfMRI to examine alterations in ReHo in AD patients after donepezil intervention compared with healthy controls (HCs). Based on previous studies of the brains of AD patients before and after donepezil-based interventions [ \u2013 ], we hypothesized that, relative to baseline status and the HC group, the post-intervention AD group would display altered ReHo in regions of the orbitofrontal gyrus (OFG) that are critical to cognitive and emotional regulation [ \u2013 ]. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSixteen subjects with mild or moderate AD completed this longitudinal study from January 2018 to July 2022 at Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. Subjects with AD met probable AD criteria according to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association guidelines [ ]. Subjects were right-handed with a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score\u2009<\u200924, and\u2009>\u20096 years of education. Sixteen healthy subjects were recruited as HCs at Tongde Hospital. They had no cognitive impairment and a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0. Participants were excluded if they had the following conditions: a history of psychiatric disorders, were taking antidepressant drugs, or had MRI contraindications. All participants signed informed consent forms. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee (2017-11-12). \n\nSeverity of depression was rated using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia [ ] and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) [ ]. Depressive symptoms were considered present when the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia score was\u2009\u2264\u20096 and the NPI depression domain score was\u2009\u2265\u20094 [ \u2013 ]. \n\n\n### MRI scanning \n  \nA 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner with an eight-channel head coil (Siemens Magnetom Verio, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) was used. Axial functional images were obtained using a gradient echo-planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092000\u00a0ms, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u200930\u00a0ms, slices\u2009=\u200933, thickness\u2009=\u20094.8\u00a0mm, gap\u2009=\u20090\u00a0mm, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009200\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009200\u00a0mm, acquisition matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, and flip angle (FA)\u2009=\u200990\u00b0. The fMRI process took 6\u00a0min and 40\u00a0s. High-resolution three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo T1-weighted imaging sequences were obtained using the following parameters: inversion time (TI)\u2009=\u2009900\u00a0ms, TR\u2009=\u20091900\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u20092.48\u00a0ms, slices\u2009=\u2009128, thickness\u2009=\u20091\u00a0mm, gap\u2009=\u20090\u00a0mm, FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u00a0mm, acquisition matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, and FA\u2009=\u20099\u00b0. \n\n\n### Data processing \n  \nSPM12 ( ) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit plus V1.25 (RESTplus V1.25) ( ) were used for data preprocessing. The first ten volumes were removed, slice-timing was performed, and motion correction was applied. Participants had low head motion in terms of framewise displacement (mean\u2009<\u20090.5). We initially coregistered fMRI pictures to each person's high-resolution T1 anatomical scan and then normalized them to the MNI152 template before they were normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute space. Next, we performed linear detrending and temporal band-pass filtering (0.01\u20130.08\u00a0Hz). Cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and head motion artifacts were regressed out of each voxel's time series to eliminate spurious signals. \n\n\n### ReHo calculations \n  \nThe preprocessed images were then used to perform ReHo computation. Individual ReHo maps were created using Kendall\u2019s coefficient of concordance to determine the degree of resemblance between a given voxel's time series and that of its 26 closest neighbors. The ReHo maps were then normalized by dividing the value of each voxel by the global average. Finally, a Gaussian kernel (full width at half maximum\u2009=\u20096 mm) was used to spatially smooth the standardized mean ReHo maps. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nStatistical software was used to analyze demographic and clinical traits (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v.15.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Age and education differences were assessed using a two-sample   t   test, and sex distribution differences were assessed using the Chi-squared test. \n\nThe ReHo maps were compared voxel-by-voxel among the three groups using one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). We then extracted brain masks that displayed significant differences in the ANCOVA analysis. Finally, we performed post hoc   t   tests between each pair of groups using the ANCOVA brain masks. The two-sample   t   test was used for the post hoc comparison of the AD and HC groups, and the paired   t   test was used to compare the pre- and post-intervention AD groups. We removed the mean relative head motion displacements of age and sex as covariates in the ANCOVA and   t   tests to ensure the accuracy of the results. With an individual voxel   p   value\u2009<\u20090.005 and a cluster size\u2009>\u200925 voxels, the significance level was set at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (AlphaSim-corrected for multiple comparisons). We used the REST Slice Viewer ( ) to display the differential brain regions and the Automated Anatomical Labeling 3 standard template was used as the reference standard for brain region localisation. \n\n\n### Relationship between ReHo values and clinical variables \n  \nWe extracted the mean ReHo values of abnormal brain regions and used Pearson correlation analysis to investigate the relationships between abnormal ReHo values and clinical variables in AD patients pre- and post-intervention (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). \n\n\n### ReHo-based efficacy prediction \n  \nWe developed pattern recognition models to evaluate the ability of ReHo values to predict the efficacy of donepezil intervention in AD. Pre-intervention ReHo values in AD abnormal brain regions were used as input variables and post-intervention efficacy measures were used as output variables. Post-intervention efficacy was divided into two categories: cognitive function (assessed using the MMSE) and depressive symptoms (assessed using the NPI). When comparing MMSE scores pre- and post-intervention, \u0394MMSE\u2009>\u20090 was considered good cognitive function efficacy. For NPI scores, a 50% increase was considered good depressive symptom efficacy. We built the prediction model using the fitcnb and fitcknn functions of MATLAB 2019b with a fivefold cross-check. We then calculated the area under the curve to evaluate the accuracy of ReHo values for predicting intervention efficacy. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Neuropsychological results \n  \nDemographic and clinical data are shown in Table\u00a0 . There were no significant between-group differences in age, sex distribution, or educational attainment (  p  \u2009=\u20090.107, 0.157, and 0.240, respectively). Compared with HCs, the AD group had significantly lower MMSE scores and higher NPI scores (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001).   \nDemographic and neuropsychological data \n  \nData are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation.

Compared with HCs, post-intervention AD patients had reduced ReHo in the inferior frontal gyrus/orbit part (IFG.orb) (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ), and pre-intervention AD patients had reduced ReHo in the right IFG.orb (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ).   \nBrain regions showing abnormal regional homogeneity values among the three groups.

The predicted area under the curve (AUC) value for Mini-Mental State Examination improvement after intervention was 0.7619. The predicted AUC value for Neuropsychiatric Inventory improvement after intervention was 0.6500 \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we used rsfMRI data to examine ReHo in AD patients both before and after donepezil intervention relative to HCs. Compared with HCs, AD patients had reduced ReHo in the IFG.orb. Moreover, pre-intervention ReHo values of abnormal brain regions in AD patients were 76% accurate for predicting the efficacy of donepezil intervention on cognitive function and 65% accurate for predicting its efficacy on depressive symptoms. \n\nThe results of the ReHo analysis revealed that IFG.orb was the main abnormal brain region between the three groups. Neurofibrillary tangle pathology is widespread in the orbital prefrontal cortex of AD patients [ ]. The OFG receives and integrates input from multiple senses, such as vision, taste, and smell [ ]. In particular, olfactory system dysfunction is closely linked to AD [ ,  ]. Sedghizadeh et al. collected olfactory data from AD patients and HCs and used high-frequency frontal oscillations in response to olfactory stimuli to classify AD and HCs with an accuracy of 91.7% [ ]. Mega et al. [ ] divided 30 AD patients into three groups based on behavioral responses to donepezil (responders, non-responders, and no change). Compared with non-responders, responders had more significant de-inhibitory and euphoric sensations as well as significantly lower OFG and dorsolateral frontal perfusion. This suggests that orbitofrontal syndrome predicts behavioral responses to cholinesterase inhibitor treatment in AD patients. \n\nThe OFG is a major part of the limbic system [ ], and a previous study has suggested that the neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression may include abnormal activity in limbic system brain regions [ ]. Furthermore, resting-state functional connectivity between the left anterior cingulate cortex and left OFG was reduced in individuals with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder compared with healthy controls [ ]. Matt et al. [ ] used ultrasound brain stimulation as a clinical intervention for AD patients and reported post-intervention improvements in both cognitive function and depressive symptoms. In addition, functional connectivity differences between the salient network and left OFG were reduced compared with healthy controls. Our results suggest that the OFG is an important target for intervention in AD patients and is the main imaging marker for predicting the efficacy of donepezil intervention in AD patients. \n\nSome limitations to our study should be noted. First, although fMRI studies have shown that a sample size of 13 subjects per group ensures 80% statistical power, relatively small sample sizes can affect the robustness of statistical results. Second, different imaging modalities allow changes in brain function to be observed from different perspectives, for example, the changes in white matter [ ]. Thus, the combination of different imaging methods should be used to explore multimodal imaging markers for predicting the efficacy of donepezil intervention in AD. Third, MRI data were collected after 24\u00a0weeks of donepezil intervention only. Collecting MRI data after 4, 8, and 16\u00a0weeks of intervention may improve our understanding of brain changes with donepezil intervention in patients with AD. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn the current study, we compared ReHo among AD patients before and after donepezil intervention and HCs. Abnormal brain regions were located in the OFG. These findings may allow a better understanding of the brain mechanisms of donepezil intervention in AD and the corresponding imaging markers. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table\u00a01\nUnnamed: 0\tAD group\tHCs group\tc2/t-value\tp value\nGender, n (M/F)\t16 (8/8)\t16(7/9)\t2.0\t0.157\nAge, years\t65.2\u2009\u00b1\u20098.1\t69.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5\t1.659\t0.107\nEducation, years\t9.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\t8.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\t1.198\t0.240\nDuration, months\t15\u2009\u00b1\u20098.8\t\t\t\nMMSE\t19.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6\t29.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.90\t-10.342\t<\u20090.001\nMMSE(24w)\t20.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5\t\t\t\nNPI\t4.56\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9\t0.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36\t12.632\t<\u20090.001\nNPI(24w)\t1.38\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\t\t\t\nCSDD\t3.25\u2009\u00b1\u20092.40\t\t\t\nCSDD(24w)\t0.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.71\t\t\t\n### Caption\nDemographic and neuropsychological data\n### Footer\nData are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation.

{"text": "Appelgren, Alva and Bengtsson, Sara L\nPLoS One, 2015\n\n# Title\n\nFeedback on Trait or Action Impacts on Caudate and Paracingulum Activity\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nThere is a general conception that positive associations to one\u2019s trait, e.g. \u2018I\u2019m clever\u2019, are beneficial for cognitive performance. Scientific evidence shows that this is a simplification. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we used written trial-based trait feedback \u2018you are clever\u2019, or task feedback \u2018your choice was correct\u2019, on each correct response of a rule-switching task, to investigate how the character of positive self-associations influences performance outcome. Twenty participants took part in this crossover design study. We found that trait feedback was less beneficial for motivation and performance improvement, and resulting in enhanced neural activation on more difficult bivalent rule trials. This indicates that the task was treated as more complex in this condition. For example, \u2018you are clever\u2019 feedback led to enhanced activation in anterior caudate nucleus, an area known to process uncertainty. We further observed that activation in anterior paracingulate cortex was sensitive to whether self-reflection was imposed by external feedback or generated from internal processes, where the latter activation correlated positively with performance when following after task feedback. Our results illustrate how feedback can evoke self-reflections that either help or hinder motivation and performance, most likely by impacting on processes of uncertainty. The results support social psychological models stipulating that trait focus take resources away from task focus. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSelf-reflection is an inherent trait in humans and is there to enable predictions about one\u2019s behaviour so that one can regulate attention and make informed choices [ ]. In a review by Passingham et al., [ ], several examples from animal and human brain imaging studies were presented which showed that external signals activate partly different neural processes, and displays different anatomical connectivity profiles, than do internal self-reflective processes. While task processes take place in the lateral part of the cortex, internal processes are mainly processed on the medial surface. When performing a cognitive task, such as a rule-switching task where action relevant cues are visually presented, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is active primarily in the learning stage, whereas activity in neurons of the premotor cortices and caudate control the task once learned [ , ]. Likewise, there is now substantial support for a role for the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC) in processing abstract representations of abilities [ ]. When participants reflect upon whether a trait applies to themselves or not, aMPFC activity increases [ , ], or when trait words are processed as compared to non-trait words [ ]. \n\nLess is known about aMPFC activation during cognitive task performance. Having positive associations to one\u2019s traits is regarded beneficial for performance with the argument that a positive self-view helps with persistence on a task when facing difficulties [ ]. A proposed mechanism is that believing in one\u2019s abilities generates a self-fulfilling prophecy, which influences how we strive to achieve our goals [ ]. Similarly, associations to being intelligent have been found to increase the confidence in participants\u2019 memory process, as opposed to associations to stupidity [ ]. Furthermore, it has been found that when participants believe that their trait is being evaluated, such as their intelligence, error-activation in the paracingulum of aMPFC increases when performing a working memory task [ , ]. This suggests that aMPFC plays a role in performance monitoring from a self-image perspective. \n\nHowever, these latter studies are inconclusive as to whether it is beneficial for performance accuracy to make associations with cleverness during task performance. In fact, negative effects on performance and motivation as a consequence of a positive self-view have been reported [ , ]. For example, a heightened self-view in the form of high achievement based self-esteem can be a factor behind burnout symptoms [ ]. Thus, it may be that the character of the positive self-association is important for performance outcome. There are two principal mind-sets regarding intelligence which have been proposed to be particularly relevant for task motivation and performance; the entity mind-set and the incremental mind-set [ ]. A person holding an entity mind-set perceives intelligence as something that is an unchangeable part of their character. An individual with an incremental mind-set on the other hand, regards intelligence as something that can vary with effort and training. In turn, an incremental mind-set gives rise to greater task motivation [ ], and greater performance improvements when retested [ ]. Studies on feedback have observed that praising intelligence can lead to reduced motivation, and task persistence [ , ]. Although there are several behavioural studies on the topic of praising trait and action, few studies have been looking at underlying neural mechanisms. In an EEG study it was found that having an entity mind-set was related to enhanced P3 response to performance-relevant feedback on errors as compared to incremental theorists. The error-related P3-peak was most likely stemming from aMPFC [ ]. \n\nHere we have extended the research to involve conflicts more generally by looking at correct trials using a rule-switching task [ ]. This task includes two levels of conflict; bivalent rules and univalent rules. In bivalent rule trials, a response symbol has different meanings dependent on the current rule active. It has been found that the response on bivalent correct trials, but not on univalent trials, were influenced by which ability priming (clever or stupid) the participants had received prior to the task [ ]. We therefore chose this particular task to study the effect of positive feedback related to trait and feedback related to choice of action. In this functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) study, we investigated if trait focus and task focus could be manipulated with feedback on correct responses in the rule-switching task. The aim was to study the impact of the feedback on perceived experience, performance accuracy, and neural processes with particular focus on the aMPFC. We used task feedback \u2018your choice was correct\u2019 that praised participants\u2019 choice, and trait feedback \u2018you are clever\u2019 that praised participants\u2019 intelligence in a within-subject design. We hypothesized that the trait feedback would evoke more focus on one\u2019s character with increased neural activation in paracingulate cortex of aMPFC as a result [ , ], and lead to lowered motivation and performance [ , ]. Previous studies show that individuals prone to anxiety tend to fear social feedback [ ]. Other studies show that feedback is perceived differently in participants with incremental or entity views on intelligence [ ,  ]. We therefore also tested if self-esteem, mood, and growth mind-set influenced how the feedback was processed. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty healthy participants (age 24\u00b15.6, 8 females) were scanned with fMRI twice (18.5\u00b16.45 days apart), in a crossover design. Two other participants were tested but excluded, one because of performance below chance-level, the other for attending only one session. \n\n\n### Ethical statement \n  \nParticipants gave written informed consent prior to testing. The study was approved by the local ethics committee in Stockholm (EPN), Sweden (Dnr 2014/10-31/2). Participants were neurologically healthy, right-handed, and with Swedish (n = 13) or English (n = 7) as their mother tongue. They performed the task in their native language. \n\n\n### Rule-switching task \n  \nThe participants took part in four scanning sessions, two sessions per visit, in a computer based rule-switching task [ ]. In the task, a rule symbol was presented on a computer screen for 1000ms, followed by a blank screen for 500ms before a response symbol appeared. During the presentation of the response symbol, the participants had a window of 2500ms to respond, and received feedback immediately after the motor response ( ). This was followed by jittered delay of 1.5, 4 or 6 sec before presentation of the next rule symbol. This jittered delay was introduced so as to separate (de-correlate) neural activations between the different trials, i.e. neural activations evoked by the feedback in one trial and the neural activations evoked by seeing the rule symbol in the consecutive trial. The participants responded to symbols that could be either univalent or bivalent by pressing the left or right button on a button box. The univalent trials were associated with fixed responses, e.g. when a symbol of a bow (rule symbol) is followed by a house (response symbol) a left key press is the correct answer, whereas a right key-press is correct when a bow is followed by a car ( ). Bivalent trials refer to visual pictures that were associated with different responses depending on one of the two rules possible. For example, if a rule symbol consisting of a square is followed by the response symbol of a butterfly, the participants should press the left button. On the other hand, if the rule symbol is a triangle and is followed by the same response symbol, a butterfly, the participant should press the right button (Fig   and  ). The task consisted of a distribution of 70% bivalent trials and 30% univalent trials with a distribution combination in accordance with earlier studies [ , ]. This distribution yields a fairly equal frequency of each rule; 35% presentations of each for the two bivalent rules (Fig   and  ), and a 30% occurrence of the univalent rule ( ). Univalent trials served as controls and were later in the fMRI analysis subtracted from bivalent trials in order to study brain activation related to conflicting trials. The univalent trials balance the comparisons for visual input, and motor output. In addition, by subtracting brain activation related to univalent rule trials from brain activation related to bivalent rule trials, for each participant at each visit, we reduce the influence of confounding effects, such as equipment and participant related effects, which may vary between the two scanning visits. The distribution of univalent and bivalent trials was identical between the two scanning visits. The participants were presented with a set of different symbols on each visit. \n   Rule-switching task.  \nA) A univalent rule trial. A rule symbol is presented followed by one of two unique response symbols. B-C) Two bivalent rule trials. Two different rule symbols are used to determine the action to a subsequent response symbol. For example, when seeing the butterfly, either the left or the right key should be pressed depending on preceding rule symbol. A-C) The feedback presented was either task feedback \u2018your choice was correct\u2019 or trait feedback \u2018you are clever\u2019 for correct responses, and 'wrong' for incorrect responses. \n  \n#### Practice \n  \nThe task, with feedback, was practiced for 12 trials on a PC computer in a testing room prior to fMRI scanning. If the participant\u2019s accuracy was <60% they received task instructions again and practiced until achieving \u226560% correct. Two participants gave <60% correct responses on their first practice trial. Inside the scanner, the participants were familiarized with the button box and the visual display for another 12 trials before data collection started. \n\n\n#### Feedback \n  \nEach scanning visit comprised of a feedback session (FS) followed by a no feedback session (NFS). During the FS, the feedback was presented immediately after each key-press. The feedback was either task feedback \u2018Your choice was correct\u2019/\u2019Du valde r\u00e4tt\u2019 (Swedish), or trait feedback \u2018You are clever\u2019/\u2018Du \u00e4r smart\u2019 (Swedish) for corrects and \u2018Wrong\u2019/\u2018Fel\u2019 (Swedish) for incorrect responses. During the NFS there was no feedback given neither on corrects nor on errors. The FS consisted of 100 trials and the NFS consisted of 50 trials. Only one of the feedbacks was given per visit. The order of which feedback type (task/trait) was received on their first and second visit was counterbalanced among participants. The consequence of the counterbalance is that the time confound of NFS always following FS does not affect the comparison between the two feedback conditions \u2018You are clever\u2019 and \u2018Your choice was correct\u2019. Moreover, the identical number of trials between the two feedback conditions, and the fact that we analyze the data with a 2x2 ANOVA, gives the unequal number of presentations between FS and NFS, and univalent and bivalent trials, negligible impact on the results [ ]. \n\n\n\n### Questionnaires \n  \nA minimum of one day before the experiment (mean 6.5\u00b19.2 days), all participants filled in the following questionnaires using Google forms; Burns depression inventory [ ] and Rosenberg self-esteem score [ ], and four selected questions regarding intelligence mind-set orientation [ ]. The assessment of mind-set was calculated by subtracting the scores of the two entity questions from the scores of two incremental questions. The questions were answered by numbers 1\u20136; 1-Strongly disagree, 6-strongly agree. After subtraction, negative scores indicated agreement with an incremental mind-set and positive scores indicated agreement with entity mind-set. \n\n\n### Motivation ratings \n  \nAt three times during scanning, the participants rated their motivation, stress, and task difficulty by answering three questions asked by the experimenter; How motivated are you to continue with the task?; How stressed do you feel right now?; How difficult did you find the task? Ratings were of 1\u201310; 1-very calm/unmotivated/easy, 10-very stressed/motivated/difficult. The questions were asked before the cognitive task, after FS, and after NFS (difficulty ratings were not given before the task). These are presented in  . After the experiment, the participants wrote down how they experienced the feedback during the different sessions with the questions; What did you think about the test with feedback? What did you think about the test without feedback? They were subsequently debriefed about the purpose of the experiment. \n   Behavioural data.        \n\n### Behavioural Data Analysis \n  \nThe data was presented using Cogent software (UCL, London, UK) which is running in Matlab (r2010a, The Math Works, MA, USA). Accuracy (% correct), reaction time (RT), motivation scores, stress scores, and difficulty scores were analysed with repeated measures ANOVAs, and Student\u2019s paired t-tests for post-hoc comparisons in SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA). We report behavioural results from a 2x2 repeated measure ANOVA with the factors feedback (task/trait) and time (FS/NFS). All the behavioural analyses were controlled for the order of which the participants received each feedback type (day of testing). We further investigated if there were any correlations between the outcome measures; accuracy, RT for correct responses, motivation scores and the Burns/Rosenberg questionnaires, using Pearson correlations in SPSS. \n\n\n### Imaging acquisition \n  \nFunctional imaging data were acquired using a 3T GE scanner (Discovery MR750, GE). Functional images sensitive to blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrasts were acquired using echo-planar imaging as T2*-weighted images. Whole brain image volumes were built up from contiguous oblique slices (n = 40), flip angle 90\u00b0, TR = 2600ms; TE = 30ms; FOV 28,8cm; matrix size 64*64; voxel size 2x2x2mm, slice thickness 3.0mm with 0.5mm gap. A high-resolution 3D gradient-echo, T1-weighted anatomical image was also collected for each participant. We used an 8-channel head coil. \n\n\n### Brain imaging data analysis \n  \nThe fMRI data was analysed in SPM12b ( , London, UK) [ ]. The first six volumes were discarded and the remaining volumes realigned to the first volume to correct for head movements. Subsequently, the volumes were co-registered and normalized to standard space using the Montreal Neurological Institute reference brain. The time series were smoothed spatially with an isotropic Gaussian filter of 8 mm full width at half-maximum. \n\nThe fMRI data was modeled as an event-related design with regressors corresponding to bivalent, univalent, correct, and incorrect trials for the conditions with immediate feedback (trait/task) (FS) and for the subsequent conditions without feedback (NFS), for each scanning visit. The events of the trials (bivalent/univalent and correct/incorrect) were time-locked to the presentation of the rule symbol, and the key response. \n\nWhole brain statistical parametric maps were calculated for these event-related condition-specific effects with the general linear model. The vectors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function, and the data were high-pass filtered with a frequency cut-off of 128 sec. \n\nThe subject-specific effects were taken up to a second-level full-factorial analyses based on summary statistics from the contrast-images created on the first level, using 2 factors with 2 levels each; rule (univalent/bivalent) and condition (task/trait). Due to the low number of error trials we excluded the factor outcome. \n\nWe investigated the main effect of bivalent trials, main effect of condition (task/trait), and interactions between rule (bivalent/univalent) and condition (task/trait) where we present both cross-over (co) and one-way (ow) results. This was done for both the FS and the NFS. We also investigated the interaction between condition (task/trait) and time (FS/NFS). The analyses were focused on the event that was locked to the time of seeing the rule symbol, as well as at the time of pressing the key i.e. seeing the feedback. \n\nWe also investigated if BOLD was related to motivation scores, stress scores, difficulty scores as measures in between the FS and NFS, and performance accuracy for the following conditions: BOLD at the event of seeing the bivalent rule symbol, and at the event of seeing the feedback, in the trait feedback and task feedback conditions during the FS and NFS. For this purpose, we added each rating separately as a covariate in second level SPM analyses. Because we tested four different outcome measures, we then corrected the p-values for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni\u2019s corrections. \n\nIn order to test for significance, we carried out whole brain Family Wise Error corrected statistics (p<0.05) ( ). In  , we also present results on p<0.001 uncorrected level. To investigate if the activations found on the uncorrected level fell within task specific areas, we applied a mask generated from the activation pattern of the contrast: Main effect Rule (bivalent vs univalent) whole brain corrected. To test the hypothesis of feedback sensitive activity in aMPFC we carried out restricted region of interest (ROI) analyses based on previous findings of paracingulate cortex (-10 50 30) [ , ]. We report results corresponding to ROIs in the shape of a sphere with a radius 6mm, p-value <0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons (FWE). Anatomical locations were verified using the atlas of Duvernoy [ ]. \n   Brain activations at a statistical threshold of p<0.05 FWE-whole brain corrected.           Brain activations at a statistical threshold of p<0.001 uncorrected.  \nBrain activation at uncorrected (p<0.001) statistics for feedback session (FS) and no feedback session (NFS) at the event of seeing the rule symbols and at the event of making a key press/seeing the feedback \u2018you are clever\u2019 and \u2018your choice was correct\u2019, for bivalent trials (bi) and univalent trials (uni) trials. co\u2014cross-over analysis, ow\u2014one way analysis. \n    \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioural results \n  \n#### Questionnaires \n  \nWe found a correlation between Burns depression scores and Rosenberg self-esteem scores (Pearson correlations, r = 0.87, p = 0.001) where the lower the self-esteem the more negative mood. When correlating ratings on Burns depression inventory and Rosenberg\u2019s self-esteem scale with motivation ratings during the scanning, performance accuracy, or RT, we did not find any significant correlations (Pearson correlations r<0.1, p>0.05). When analyzing participants\u2019 incremental and entity views on intelligence we found twelve participants holding an incremental view and seven participants holding an entity view. One participant got a score of zero, meaning neither nor. There was no significant interaction between mind-set and feedback on accuracy (F  = 0.387, p = 0.543, two-tailed), nor RT, (F  = 0.861 p = 0.769, two-tailed). There was a significant interaction between mind-set and feedback when looking at motivation (F  = 6.040, p = 0.026, two-tailed). Motivation score in participants with an entity mind-set was 5.43\u00b13.04 after trait-feedback (FS) and 8.14\u00b11.86 after action feedback (FS) (t  = 2.03, p = 0.09, two-tailed). Motivation score in participants with an incremental mind-set was 7.25\u00b12.05 after trait feedback (FS) and 6.91\u00b12.15 after action feedback (FS), (t  = 0.87, p = 0.4, two-tailed). \n\n\n#### Accuracy \n  \nThe behavioural data revealed a significant effect of time (FS or NFS) on accuracy (F  = 6,24, p = 0.02, Fig   and  ). The post-hoc analysis showed that accuracy was higher in the NFS than the FS both in the trait-feedback sessions (t  = 4.7, p = 0.017) and in the task-feedback sessions (t  = 2.6, p = 0.0001). Overall, accuracy was significantly higher for univalent trials compared to bivalent trials trials during FS (F  = 31.18, p = 0.001) and during NFS (F  = 8.796, p = 0.008) ( ). We observed an effect of feedback when looking at accuracy improvement (NFS accuracy\u2014FS accuracy) from FS to NFS, over all correct trials (Fig   and  ). Task-feedback lead to a greater improvement than trait-feedback when looking at time(FS/NFS)*feedback (task/trait), (F  = 3.550, p = 0.038, one-sided), where task-feedback had an average increase of 6.4% SD\u00b16.5, and trait-feedback gave an increase of 3.8% SD\u00b16.0. Looking only at the bivalent trials, again there was a significant improvement in favour of task feedback (time(FS/NFS)*feedback (task/trait), F  = 3.907, p = 0.032, one-sided). This effect was absent for univalent trials (time(FS/NFS)*feedback (task/trait), F  = 0.423, p = 0.26, one-sided) ( ). \n   Performance improvement and motivation scores for task and trait-feedback during FS and NFS.  \nA) Both feedback conditions resulted in performance improvement from FS to NFS. B) Task-feedback led to greater improvement compared to trait-feedback (NFS vs. FS). C) The participants were more motivated to continue with the task after task-feedback compare to trait-feedback. \n  \n\n#### Reaction time \n  \nThere was a significant effect of time (FS/NFS) on RT for correct responses (F  = 29.32, p = 0.0001). RT was slower in FS than NFS for both task and trait-feedback. Bivalent trials were slower than univalent trials in FS (F(2,18) = 51.1, p = 0.001), but there was no difference between bivalent and univalent trials in NFS (F(2,18) = 0.34, p = 0.57). There was a trend for a difference between condition (task/trait) and trial type (bivalent/univalent) (F(1,18) = 3.305, p = 0.086, two-sided), where the participants tended to slow the bivalent trials in the trait feedback condition ( ). \n\n\n#### Motivation ratings \n  \nThere was a main effect of feedback on motivational scores (F  = 6.244, p = 0.022). After the task-feedback FS, motivation scores were significantly higher than after trait-feedback FS (task-feedback: 7.4\u00b12.03; trait-feedback 6.65\u00b12.50, F  = 6.2, p = 0.01,one-tailed) ( ). There was no main effect of time (FS/NFS) on motivational scores (F  = 0.71, p = 0.50), nor a difference in motivation before the scanning started between the two visits (t( ) = 1.65, p = 0.21) ( ). \n\n\n#### Stress ratings \n  \nThere was a significant effect of feedback on stress scores as measured after the FS and NFS (F  = 14.69, p = 0.001), where task-feedback induced less stress than trait-feedback. There was also a significant interaction between feedback and order (F  = 12.13, p = 0.003), where stress scores were higher on the first visit both after FS and NFS compared to the second visit, when receiving trait-feedback. There was no effect of time (FS/NFS) on stress scores (F  = 2.355, p = 0.13). \n\n\n#### Difficulty ratings \n  \nThere was no effect of feedback on difficulty scores, (F  = 0.22, p = 0.65), nor time (FS/NFS) (F  = 1.32, p = 0.27). \n\n\n#### Debriefing \n  \nThe following data was revealed from the debriefing about feedback experiences. In regard to task-feedback (FS), 75% of the participants were positive, 20% negative, and 5% neutral. In regard to NFS following the task-feedback, 70% were positive, 25% negative, and 5% neutral. In regard to trait-feedback (FS), 30% were positive, 45% negative, and 25% neutral. In regard to NFS following trait-feedback, 60% were positive, 20% negative, and 20% neutral. Thus, trait related feedback was most disliked. Positive views typically included \u2018nice\u2019, \u2018motivating\u2019, or \u2018it was good\u2019. Negative views typically included \u2018distracting\u2019, \u2018annoying\u2019, or \u2018repetitive\u2019. \n\n\n#### Brain activation \n  \nThe left anterior caudate nucleus was more active at the event of seeing the bivalent rule symbol in the FS in the condition where the participants were presented with the feedback \u2018you are clever\u2019, as compared to the condition where they received the feedback \u2018your choice was correct\u2019. This was revealed both in a cross-over and in a one-way analysis between rule (bivalent vs. univalent) and condition (trait vs. task) (24 20 18, t = 5.39, p = 0.014; -22 18 -12, t = 5.09, p = 0.036 FWE whole brain corrected) ( ,  ). Brain activations at a lower statistical threshold (p<0.001 uncorrected) are presented in  . We note that caudate activation was not seen to differ between the two feedback types when contrasting FS bivalent trials to NFS bivalent trials (trait [FS-NFS] vs. task [FS-NFS] and vice versa) ( ). This suggests that the effect of feedback is more pronounced on bivalent trials and less so on univalent trials. This finding is in line with the accuracy and RT data, which show feedback dependent differences for bivalent trials but not univalent trials. \n   Brain activation in left anterior caudate nucleus when seeing rule symbols.  \nA) Activity increased at the event of seeing the bivalent rule symbols in FS for \u2018you are clever\u2019. B) % BOLD signal change for each condition and rule type. \n  \nNone of the ratings regarding perceived quality (stress/motivation/difficulty) correlated with BOLD in this area for the feedback condition \u2018you are clever\u2019. \n\nWhen investigating activity of the paracingulate cortex of aMPFC specifically, again we found increased activation in particular when the rule symbol was presented for the feedback condition \u2018you are clever\u2019. Seeing the rule symbol during the FS was reflected as enhanced activity when investigating main effect trait vs. task (bivalent + univalent) (12 52 28, t = 2.46, p<0.05 corr 4mm ROI) (Fig   and  ). Seeing the rule symbol during the NFS was reflected as enhanced activity when investigating the interaction between rule (bivalent vs. univalent) and condition (trait vs. task) (6 50 26, t = 2.76, p<0.05 corr ROI), as well as in the simple contrast trait bivalent rule vs. trait univalent rule (6 50 28, t = 3.08, p<0.02 corr ROI). None of the quality ratings correlated with BOLD in this area for the condition \u2018you are clever\u2019. Instead, there was a significant positive correlation between BOLD and performance accuracy at the event of seeing the bivalent rule symbol, in the NFS following \u2018your choice was correct\u2019 (16 50 30, t = 4.26, p<0.008 Bonferroni corrected, ROI). \n   Brain activation in anterior paracingulate cortex when seeing rule symbols.  \nA) % BOLD signal change for each condition and rule type. B) Activity increased in the trait condition compared to task condition. \n  \nAt the time of seeing the feedback, there was no activation surviving the conservative statistical threshold of correcting for multiple comparisons in the whole brain. We observe however, that at the threshold p<0.001 uncorrected, there is more activity when seeing the feedback \u2018you are clever\u2019 as compared to \u2018your choice was correct\u2019 ( ). Increased activations when seeing the feedback \u2018you are clever\u2019 vs. \u2018your choice was correct\u2019 in bivalent trials as compared to univalent trials, were found in right inferior frontal gyrus (48 32 -2, t = 3.32) and left superior temporal gyrus (-46 6 -10, t = 3.24). Increased activation when seeing the feedback \u2018your choice was correct\u2019 vs. \u2018you are clever\u2019 in bivalent trials as compared to univalent trials, was observed in cuneus (-8 -98 14, t = 3.25). In the NFS, at the time of the response, which is the time when the feedback was presented in the first part of the scanning session, activation increased in the visual cortex (anterior calcarine sulcus, -16 -46 8, t = 4.47) and cerebellum (-24 -48 -38, t = 3.32). This was seen for the contrast comparing activation during \u2018you are clever\u2019 to \u2018your choice was correct\u2019 in bivalent trials as compared to univalent trials. On the other hand, the condition \u2018your choice was correct\u2019 vs. \u2018you are clever\u2019 (bivalent trials vs. univalent trials) gave rise to left caudate (-10 12 18, t = 4.01) and left insular cortex (-40 18 12, t = 3.7) activation increase. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe found that trial-based written feedback influenced participants\u2019 perceived experience and their performance. The participants were more motivated to continue with the task after the FS \u2018your choice was correct\u2019 than after the FS \u2018you are clever\u2019. They also perceived less stress in the \u2018your choice was correct\u2019 condition, and showed a significantly greater improvement in accuracy from FS to NFS. In the debriefing after the testing, nine of the participants expressed negative views about the feedback \u2018you are clever\u2019, whereas only four participants reported negative views about the task feedback. Thus, although both feedback types informed the participants about their correct outcome, the one addressing a trait gave rise to a more negative experience. This result is in line with a number of previous behavioural studies observing that trait-focused feedback has a negative effect on mainly motivation, but also on performance [ \u2013 , , ]. \n\nInterestingly, in the \u2018you are clever\u2019 condition we observed enhanced activation for the bivalent rule trials in particular. Mostly at the time when the bivalent rule symbol was presented. This means that the feedback-induced effects influence task monitoring. When looking at the simple, univalent trials the difference between the feedback types cease to appear. For example, we observed significantly greater activation in caudate nucleus for bivalent trials in the condition \u2018you are clever\u2019 than in the condition \u2018your choice was correct\u2019, but there was no difference between the two conditions when it came to the univalent trials. Related finding was made when looking at the behavioural data; RT and accuracy, where no difference was seen between feedback conditions in how univalent trials were treated, but more so when studying bivalent trials. We also looked at the bivalent trials during FS when using NFS bivalent trials as a control, to investigate if caudate was more active as a function of the actual feedback. There was no support for such a process, which strengthen the notion that more complex bivalent, rather than simple univalent trials, are targets for effects induced by the feedback. Similar observations have been made previously in that trait associations are particularly influential on neural activity and behaviour during events of uncertainty, such as errors or bivalent rule cues [ \u2013 , ]. The results suggest that the \u2018You are clever\u2019 feedback does not induce active and constant thoughts regarding one\u2019s trait. Rather, it seems that the feedback influences processes that impacts on neurotransmitter levels so that, in moments of uncertainties, the neurons are signaling differently. The most likely neurons to be affected by the feedback are the one\u2019s sensitive to dopamine. This is so because the caudate nucleus is known to innervate high densities of dopamine sensitive neurons [ , ] and uncertainty is reflected in dopamine signals [ ,  ]. \n\nUncertainty is a measure of the quality of the participant\u2019s own estimate of the data [ ]. Poor quality can be due to that not enough data has been collected [ ], or because of poor confidence in the memory for data presented [ ]. The latter would be the likely explanation in the present context as the two feedback conditions \u2018You are clever\u2019 and \u2018Your choice was correct\u2019 did not differ in the number of data presentations. Reduced confidence in memory could be due to factors such as anxiety, more demanding interpretation of the feedback, or deviation from task focus. Increased caudate activation has previously been observed when individuals anticipate the value of outcomes [ ], where participants with social anxiety show higher activation in caudate nucleus in anticipation to a performance outcome compared to controls [ , ]. Individuals may be more sensitive to information regarding their character (clever as opposed to correct action). According to the processing efficiency theory [ ], anxiety makes us use compensatory strategies, such as increased effort, in order to perform well. Another possibility to the observed feedback effects could be that the participants have to engage in a two-step interpretation process in the \u2018you are clever\u2019 condition. They need to translate \u2018you are clever\u2019 into \u2018I made the correct choice\u2019, which requires extra neuronal resources. It has previously been observed that trial-to-trial feedback with low additional information content distracts task attention [ ]. A third possible explanation to the observed effects of the feedback is that of a model in social psychology which proposes that attentional shift from action to trait leads to performance impairments due to reduced cognitive resources for the task [ ]. For example, working memory capacity has been found to be influenced by how we think about our abilities [ ]. Here, the authors induced the stereotypic belief that women are inferior to men in mathematics. Participants receiving the stereotypic framing in this study did not differ in math scores compared to a control group, but the men and women in the primed group took longer time on the math equations and had higher concerns about how the researcher would rate their performance compared to the control group. The main aim of the study however, was to look at how participants performed on a working memory task which was incorporated between the math equations. Results on the working memory task revealed that the women in the stereotypic group recalled fewer words when compared to a control group of women. This implies that the threat of belonging to a negative stereotype makes participants reflect upon themselves and their abilities, which then interferes with attentional resources needed for the working memory task. Furthermore, Bengtsson and Penny [ ] developed a model of the rule-switching task after participants had been primed with association to \u2018clever\u2019 and \u2018stupid\u2019. The model is based on the current understanding that neuronal populations estimate prior probabilities of outcomes and their expected value. In short, the model stipulates that the individual, by using Bayesian inference, attributes the probability of the cause of a response outcome (correct/error) to either a me-process or a task-process. Associations to \u2018clever\u2019 led to enhanced me-focus during correct responses. \n\nWhen investigating activity in paracingulate cortex, we made two observations. Firstly, we found that this area was more active in the \u2018you are clever\u2019 condition during the FS. Secondly, in the absence of feedback, in the NFS following \u2018your choice was correct\u2019, we found that participants\u2019 performance accuracy correlated positively with BOLD here. These observations were made at the event when they were viewing the bivalent rule symbols. Our results strengthen the notion that this area is involved in self-focused processes during cognitive performance [ , ]. However, these new findings suggest that activation in paracingulate cortex is sensitive to whether external information about oneself is presented, or if the individual relies on internal self-monitoring. \n\nWe further investigated if aspects such as self-esteem, mood, and growth mind-set impacted on how the feedbacks were processed. We found no support for that self-esteem or mood influenced the perception of the feedback. Nor did we observe any effects on accuracy and reaction time in the interactions between feedback and growth mind-set. We noted that there was a tendency for task feedback (your choice was correct) to be particularly beneficial for motivation in individuals with an entity view on intelligence. This could be interpreted in line with the predictions of Dweck et al., (2004) [ ] stipulating that entity theorists are more concerned about their outcome whereas incremental theorists are more interested in the knowledge acquired. Although what has been observed previously is a difference between the two mind-sets when processing negative feedback [ ]. The current sample sizes are very small and therefore we are making observations but not drawing any conclusions regarding how a growth mind-set is influencing this type of feedback. \n\nWe made the decision to scan the participants with 2\u20133 weeks apart, randomly distributed between the two conditions. This time span was implemented to reduce the influence of the memory from previous visit on the current. It may be that the time factor influences the results because of for example equipment and participant related effects. However, in the brain imaging analysis, for each participant and visit, we subtracted brain activation related to univalent rules from brain activation related to bivalent rules, which lessens the influence of such confounding effects that may vary between the two scanning visits. \n\n### Conclusion \n  \nThis work sheds light on differences between the self-reflections; trait and action. It turned out that trait feedback was less beneficial for motivation and performance improvement. As a result, activity in caudate nucleus was enhanced in conflicting trials in the trait feedback condition particularly. We observed further that anterior paracingulate cortex activation was sensitive to whether self-reflection was imposed by external feedback or generated from internal processes, and that the latter activity supported performance when followed after task feedback. It should be noted however that these brain areas, which we found differentially active in the two feedback conditions, were most likely not directly differentiating between trait and action per se. Instead, their activation reflected the influence the feedback had on attention or task uncertainty. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone.0129714.t001\n### Label: Table 1\nMeasure\tFeedback\tSession\tScore\tSD\nAccuracy (percent correct)\tTrait\tFS\t91.6\t8.0\n\t-\tNFS\t95.4\t8.2\n\tTask\tFS\t90.6\t7.8\n\t-\tNFS\t97.0\t2.9\nAccuracy (bi)\tTrait\tFS\t88.4\t10.9\n\t-\tNFS\t94.4\t9.2\n\tTask\tFS\t87.2\t10.2\n\t-\tNFS\t96.5\t3.0\nAccuracy (uni)\tTrait\tFS\t97.8\t4.8\n\t-\tNFS\t97.1\t7.0\n\tTask\tFS\t97.2\t5.6\n\t-\tNFS\t97.9\t3.5\nRT correct (ms)\tTrait\tFS\t686.7\t169.8\n\t\tNFS\t629.3\t167.8\n\tTask\tFS\t692.0\t146.0\n\t-\tNFS\t637.2\t152.8\nRT correct (bi)\tTrait\tFS\t744.2\t208.2\n\t\tNFS\t624.9\t165.2\n\tTask\tFS\t738.4\t172.2\n\t-\tNFS\t638.9\t158.6\nRT correct (uni)\tTrait\tFS\t590.5\t129.7\n\t\tNFS\t639.0\t176.4\n\tTask\tFS\t620.6\t128.3\n\t-\tNFS\t633.8\t148.4\nMotivation scores (1\u201310)\tTrait\tbefore FS ???\t7.3\t2.7\n\tTrait\tafter FS\t6.6\t2.5\n\t-\tafter NFS\t5.9\t2.9\n\tTask\tbefore FS ???\t7.6\t2.6\n\tTask\tafter FS\t7.4\t2.0\n\t-\tafter NFS\t6.3\t2.6\nStress scores (1\u201310)\tTrait\tbefore FS ???\t2.5\t1.7\n\tTrait\tafter FS\t2.5\t1.3\n\t-\tafter NFS\t2.2\t1.6\n\tTask\tbefore FS ???\t2.2\t1.2\n\tTask\tafter FS\t2.2\t1.0\n\t-\tafter NFS\t1.8\t0.78\nDifficulty scores (1\u201310)\tTrait\tafter FS\t2.5\t1.4\n\t-\tafter NFS\t2.4\t1.5\n\tTask\tafter FS\t2.8\t1.5\n\t-\tafter NFS\t2.2\t1.0\n### Caption\nBehavioural data.\n### Footer\nParticipants\u2019 accuracy, reaction time on correct responses (RT) and subjective ratings of motivation, stress and difficulty.

It has been well documented that PTSD is associated with multiple functional disruptions in the brain that appear to underscore unique symptom presentations of the disorder (Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ). Real\u2010time fMRI neurofeedback (rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB) allows for such neural disruptions to be noninvasively regulated; as such rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB has been implemented in a broad range of prevalent psychiatric conditions (Linden et\u00a0al.,  ; Kirsch et\u00a0al.,  ; Li et\u00a0al.,  ; Schoenberg and David,  ; Paret et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Young et\u00a0al.,  ; Mehler et\u00a0al.,  ), including PTSD (Gerin et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Zotev et\u00a0al.,  ; Zweerings et\u00a0al.,  ; Chiba et\u00a0al.,  ; Misaki et\u00a0al.,  ; Weaver et\u00a0al.,  ). Neurobiologically informed treatment interventions are particularly in demand for PTSD as suboptimal response rates to psychotherapy and pharmacological interventions have been reported (Bradley et\u00a0al.,  ; Stein et\u00a0al.,  ; Ravindran and Stein,  ; Haagen et\u00a0al.,  ; Krystal et\u00a0al.,  ), where dropout rates remain high, particularly during trauma\u2010focused interventions (Bisson et\u00a0al.,  ; Goetter et\u00a0al.,  ; Kehle\u2010Forbes et\u00a0al.,  ; Lewis et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nIn response to this demand, emerging scientific evidence suggests that directly regulating specific brain areas associated with PTSD symptomatology may be a viable treatment option for those affected by this illness (Reiter et\u00a0al.,  ; Van der Kolk et\u00a0al.,  ; Panisch & Hai,  ; Chiba et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Rogel et\u00a0al.,  ). It has been hypothesized that normalizing the neural circuitry within large scale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) is an essential treatment avenue for reducing PTSD symptoms (Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ; Koek et\u00a0al.,  ; Szeszko & Yehuda,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Sheynin et\u00a0al.,  ). Default mode network (DMN) functional disruptions among individuals with PTSD are thought to be related to traumatic/negative autobiographical memories, distorted and dysregulated self\u2010referential processing, and alterations in social cognition (Bluhm et\u00a0al.,  ; Daniels et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ; Tursich et\u00a0al.,  ; Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ; Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ; Hinojosa et\u00a0al.,  ; Frewen et\u00a0al.,  ; Terpou et\u00a0al.,  ). Indeed, to suffer from PTSD can be described as living with a disrupted self\u2010narrative (Gerge,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ), where among individuals with PTSD, especially with early childhood maltreatment, there typically exists a highly rudimentary or shattered sense\u2010of\u2010self (Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nThe posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is the major hub of the posterior default mode network (DMN) (Greicius et\u00a0al.,  ; Buckner et\u00a0al.,  ; Spreng et\u00a0al.,  ; Qin and Northoff,  ; Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ). The PCC and the DMN are highly associated with PTSD symptoms, and display disrupted functional connectivity both at rest (Bluhm et\u00a0al.,  ; Sripada et\u00a0al.,  ; Chen & Etkin,  ; Tursich et\u00a0al.,  ; Yehuda et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ; Koch et\u00a0al.,  ; Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Barredo et\u00a0al.,  ; Hinojosa et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ) and during executive functioning tasks in PTSD (Daniels\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Melara et\u00a0al.,  ). During rest, it has been shown previously using graph theoretical analyses that connectivity within the posterior community of the DMN involving the PCC and precuneus may be increased, relative to decreased connectivity within the anterior community of the DMN involving the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (Shang et\u00a0al.,  ; Kennis et\u00a0al.,  ; Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ; Holmes et\u00a0al.,  ). Additionally, studies exploring seed\u2010based functional connectivity patterns within the DMN at rest have revealed decreased coupling between the PCC, vmPFC, and other DMN structures, which together have been associated with PTSD symptoms (Bluhm et\u00a0al.,  ; Qin et\u00a0al.,  ; Sripada et\u00a0al.,  ; Koch et\u00a0al.,  ; Miller et\u00a0al.,  ; DiGangi et\u00a0al.,  ). During working memory tasks that require executive functioning, enhanced connectivity of the PCC with other DMN areas has also been reported among individuals with PTSD as compared to increased central executive network (CEN) and salience network (SN) connectivity among healthy individuals (Daniels et\u00a0al.,  ). With respect to executive functioning tasks in PTSD, suboptimal downregulation of DMN regions may underscore difficulties in disengaging from internally focused self\u2010referential processing in order to attend to external cognitive demands (Aupperle et\u00a0al.,  ). Notably, the DMN also exhibits altered activation patterns during threatful\u2010 and trauma\u2010related conditions in PTSD. Indeed, a recent meta\u2010analysis has shown that both reexperiencing and retrieval of trauma\u2010related autobiographical memories are associated with enhanced activation within the PCC and other DMN regions among individuals with PTSD as compared to healthy controls (Thome et\u00a0al.,  ). Meta\u2010analytic results reported elsewhere also suggest that traumatic imagery tasks uniquely induce activation in the PCC, with coactivation of the precuneus, relative to healthy controls (Ramage et\u00a0al.,  ). Similarly, the presentation of trauma\u2010versus\u2010neutral words has been shown to increase activation in the PCC, the mPFC, the midbrain, and the bed\u2010nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), with concomitant decreases in activation within dlPFC emotion regulation areas in PTSD as compared to healthy controls (Awasthi et\u00a0al.,  ). This is supported by years of experimental work in the field linking these neural correlates with PTSD symptoms during both script\u2010driven imagery and the recall of trauma\u2010related autobiographical memories in PTSD (Hopper et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ; Frewen et\u00a0al.,  ; Mickleborough et\u00a0al.,  ; Ramage et\u00a0al.,  ; Liberzon & Abelson,  ; Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ; Thome et\u00a0al.,  ). As such, during trauma\u2010related stimulus exposure, it has been suggested that enhanced DMN recruitment in PTSD may coincide with self\u2010related processes that are seemingly fused with experiences of trauma, indeed reflecting the self\u2010coupled nature of the disorder (Terpou et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ). Furthermore, the PCC has been shown to be hyperactive in PTSD during emotion\u2010processing tasks in comparison to healthy individuals, where critically, longitudinal improvements in PTSD symptoms in response to trauma\u2010focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have been found to be associated with decreased PCC activation in youth with PTSD (Garrett et\u00a0al.,  ). Taken together, regulating the PCC and the DMN may represent a critical avenue to explore with respect to neurobiologically informed treatment interventions for PTSD (Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ; Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nIn support of this, previous studies in PTSD using electroencephalography neurofeedback (EEG\u2010NFB), including a randomized controlled trial by our group (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ), have examined the regulation of brain oscillations tied to the PCC and DMN (Kluetsch et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). Notably, one session of EEG\u2010NFB has been shown to lead to acute decreases in arousal symptoms among individuals with PTSD, which has been associated with a normalization of both DMN and amygdala resting\u2010state functional connectivity (Kluetsch et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). In these aforementioned EEG\u2010NFB studies, the target of NFB was the desynchronization of alpha rhythms over the PCC. Alpha oscillations are correlated with DMN activation (Mantini et\u00a0al.,  ; Jann et\u00a0al.,  ; Clancy et\u00a0al.,  ), where alpha\u2010rhythm reductions are commonly observed during the resting\u2010state in PTSD over the main hubs of the DMN (PCC and mPFC) (Clancy et\u00a0al.,  ), hypothesized to be related to chronic hyperarousal (Ros et\u00a0al.,  ; Liberzon & Abelson,  ; Abdallah et\u00a0al.,  ; Clancy et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Sitaram et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). Additionally, during a 20\u2010week randomized controlled trial of alpha\u2010desynchronizing EEG\u2010NFB in PTSD (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ), individuals in the experimental group demonstrated significantly reduced PTSD severity scores post\u2010NFB and at the 3\u2010month follow\u2010up, which was associated with a shift towards normalization of DMN resting\u2010state functional connectivity. Specifically, PTSD patients in the experimental group were found to display decreased PCC connectivity with the anterior DMN after NFB treatment (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). It was hypothesized that this may reflect normalized connectivity within over utilized posterior DMN communities consisting of the PCC and precuneus (Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ; Holmes et\u00a0al.,  ) after NFB treatment (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). Notably, PTSD remission rates as well as decreases in PTSD severity scores in the experimental group were comparable to that of current gold\u2010standard treatments for PTSD (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). Collectively, preliminary results from our previous alpha\u2010desynchronizing EEG\u2010NFB studies suggest that feedback signals tied to the DMN, and more specifically the PCC, may represent a viable target for NFB treatment in PTSD. Critically, in comparison to EEG\u2010NFB, rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB allows for increased spatial specificity with respect to precisely targeting areas in the brain and provides increased spatial resolution for examining mechanistic evidence associated with regulation. \n\nRecently, the application of rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB in PTSD has expanded greatly, where previous studies have largely focused on the regulation of the amygdala (Gerin et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Misaki et\u00a0al.,  ,  ,  ; Zotev et\u00a0al.,  ; Chiba et\u00a0al.,  ), a limbic region associated with emotion reactivity and highly implicated in PTSD symptoms (Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ). Nicholson et\u00a0al. ( ) found that downregulating the amygdala in PTSD during trauma triggers increased activity and connectivity of the dlPFC and vlPFC involved in emotion regulation and executive functioning, findings supported by other rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB groups (Misaki et\u00a0al.,  ; Zotev et\u00a0al.,  ). With regard to ICNs, Nicholson et\u00a0al. (2018) also found that downregulating the amygdala with rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB led to increased recruitment of the CEN and stabilized DMN recruitment over NFB training. This represents a critical finding as individuals with PTSD have been shown to maladaptively recruit the DMN instead of the CEN during tasks that require cognitive control (Daniels et\u00a0al.,  ). Of importance, Zotev et\u00a0al. (2018) also showed in a randomized controlled study that amygdala regulation using rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB leads to significantly reduced PTSD severity scores, including significant reductions on avoidance, hyperarousal, and depressive symptoms. Extending the amygdala rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB literature, machine learning classifiers have also been utilized to improve performance on emotional conflict tasks by differentially selecting for brain states associated with targets as compared to trauma distractors (Weaver et\u00a0al.,  ). Additionally, upregulating anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity has also been utilized in PTSD as a means to improve implicit emotion regulation capacities (Zweerings et\u00a0al.,  ). Taken together, these results suggest that regulating specific brain areas tied to the manifestation of PTSD symptoms (e.g., the PCC of the DMN) may result in clinically meaningful changes, where additional studies are urgently needed to explore novel neurofeedback targets in PTSD. \n\n### Current study \n  \nHere, we utilized rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB to train PCC downregulation during emotion induction paradigms (presentation of trauma\u2010related/distressing words) among individuals with PTSD and healthy controls. The rationale of the current study to downregulate the PCC was threefold: (1) the PCC is highly associated with PTSD symptomatology which together with other DMN areas, displays hyperactivity when trauma memories become activated (Frewen et\u00a0al.,  ; Thome et\u00a0al.,  ); (2) regulating neural signals related to the PCC/DMN using EEG\u2010NFB has shown promising preliminary evidence in a randomized controlled trial (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ); and (3) the feasibility of downregulating amygdala activation using rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB in patients with PTSD has been demonstrated, which resulted in a shift toward normalization of DMN connectivity and reduced PTSD severity scores (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Zotev et\u00a0al.,  ). Given the dynamic interplay between intrinsic brain networks (Menon,  ), we hypothesized that PCC downregulation would lead to concomitant alterations in activation among regions within the DMN (e.g., mPFC), SN, and CEN (e.g., dlPFC involved in emotion regulation). We further predicted that NFB training would lead to decreased state PTSD/emotional symptoms. Moreover, given the well\u2010documented differences between PTSD and healthy controls with respect to DMN recruitment during both emotion induction paradigms and executive functioning tasks, we hypothesized unique neural mechanisms associated with regulation (i.e., psychopathological specificity) and predicted that machine learning models would be able to accurately classify PTSD versus healthy controls during NFB training. \n\n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nOur neuroimaging sample consisted of   n  \u00a0= 30 individuals [  n  \u00a0= 15 patients with a primary diagnosis of PTSD and   n  \u00a0= 15 healthy participants (see Table\u00a0  for demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample)]. The sample size of this preliminary investigation was based on study feasibility during the time of recruitment. One participant in the PTSD group was excluded from the analyses since they reported having fallen asleep in the scanner during the transfer run, thus leaving the final sample size   n  \u00a0= 14 in the PTSD group and   n  \u00a0= 15 in the healthy control group. No individual had previously received NFB, and there was no sample overlap with our previous NFB investigations (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). There were nonsignificant differences with respect to biological sex between the PTSD and healthy control groups. However, the mean age of participants in the PTSD group was significantly higher as compared to the healthy control group. Importantly, when age was included as a covariate within the analyses described below, our neural activation results were not significantly affected. Participants were recruited from 2017 to 2019 through referrals from family physicians, mental health professionals, psychology/psychiatric clinics, community programs for traumatic stress, and posters/advertisements within the London, Ontario community. \n  \nDemographic and clinical information \n    \nThe inclusion criteria for PTSD participants included a primary diagnosis of PTSD as determined using the Clinician\u2010Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS\u20105) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM\u20105 (SCID) (First et\u00a0al.,  ; Weathers et\u00a0al.,  ). Patients with PTSD currently receiving psychotropic medication were on a stable dose for 1 month prior to their participation in the NFB study. Exclusion criteria for PTSD patients included alcohol or substance use disorder not in sustained full remission within the last 3 months prior to scanning and a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar or psychotic disorders. PTSD patients were also excluded from the study if they had prominent current suicidal ideation within the past 3 months or self\u2010injurious behaviours in the last 3 months requiring medical attention. Exclusion criteria for the healthy control group included lifetime psychiatric illness and current use of any psychotropic medications. Exclusion criteria for all participants included past or current biofeedback treatment, noncompliance with 3 Tesla fMRI safety standards, significant untreated medical illness, pregnancy, a history of neurological or pervasive developmental disorders, and previous head injury with loss of consciousness. Please see the supplementary materials section (Table  ) for a detailed report on the history of trauma exposure in each group. \n\nParticipants completed a battery of assessments before the NFB experiment, which consisted of the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck et\u00a0al.,  ), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Bernstein et\u00a0al.,  ), and the Multiscale Dissociation Inventory (MDI) (Briere,  ). In addition, in order to assess state changes in emotion\u2010related symptoms during NFB, participants completed the Response to Script Driven Imagery (RSDI) Scale (Hopper et\u00a0al.,  ) after each of the 4 fMRI runs, which consisted of the following symptom subscales: reliving, distress, physical reactions, dissociation, and numbing. All scanning took place at the Lawson Health Research Institute in London, Ontario, Canada. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at Western University, Canada, where participants gave written and informed consent and received financial compensation for participating in the study. \n\n\n### Neurofeedback paradigm \n  \nWe implemented an experimental protocol and paradigm that was identical to our previous NFB investigations (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ); however, we trained individuals to downregulate the PCC as opposed to the amygdala (Figure\u00a0 ). Participants were instructed that they would be   \u201cregulating an area of the brain related to emotional experience  ,\u201d that is, to decrease activation within the PCC. In order to elicit unbiased and personalized regulatory strategies, specific instruction on how to regulate the brain region\u2010of\u2010interest was not provided (Paret et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Zaehringer et\u00a0al.,  ). During training trials, feedback of PCC activation was displayed to participants in the form of two identical thermometers on the left and right side of a screen projected inside the scanner. The bars on the thermometer increased/decreased as BOLD signal in the PCC target fluctuated, where an orange line on the thermometer indicated baseline PCC activation (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nSchematic of the real\u2010time fMRI neurofeedback set\u2010up. Brain activity in the neurofeedback target region (posterior cingulate cortex) was processed in real\u2010time and presented to participants in the fMRI scanner as thermometers that increased or decreased as activation fluctuated. Participants completed three neurofeedback training runs and a transfer run without neurofeedback signal. Figure created with BioRender.com. \n  \nOur neurofeedback protocol consisted of three conditions: (i)   regulate  , (ii)   view  , and (iii)   neutral  . During the   regulate   condition (Figure\u00a0 ), individuals were asked to decrease activity in the brain target (decrease the bars on the thermometer corresponding to PCC activation) while viewing either personalized trauma\u2010related words for the PTSD group or a matched stressful word for the healthy control group (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). During the   view   condition, individuals were asked to respond naturally to their personalized trauma/stressful words while not attempting to regulate the target brain area.   Neutral   trials consisted of asking individuals to respond naturally to personalized neutral words for both groups. Personalized trauma/stressful words (  n  \u00a0= 10) and neutral words (  n  \u00a0= 10) were selected by participants with a trauma\u2010informed clinician and matched on subjective units of distress to control for between subject/group variability. The personalized trauma words selected by participants with PTSD were related to individual experiences of trauma. Furthermore, personalized stressful words selected by healthy controls were related to the individual's most stressful life event. Stimuli were presented with Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Berkeley, CA). Participants were first provided with written instructions, followed by a single example trial within the scanner. Our experimental design then consisted of three consecutive neurofeedback training runs, which was followed by one transfer run in which individuals were presented with the same three conditions but without neurofeedback from the thermometer. Instructions were presented for 2 s before each condition; individual conditions lasted for 24 s and were followed by a 10 s implicit resting state where participants viewed a fixation cross (Figure\u00a0 ). An experimental run lasted about 9 min and consisted of 15 trials (5 of each condition, counterbalanced and separated by an intertrial fixation cross) (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). \n  \nNeurofeedback experimental procedure for the regulate condition. The same timing was utilized for (i) view conditions in which participants viewed trauma\u2010related/distressing words while not attempting to regulate and (ii) for neutral conditions in which participants viewed neutral words and did not attempt to regulate. A trial started with a 2 s instruction slide indicating trial type (i.e., regulate, view, neutral). In the following block, participants saw either a trauma\u2010related/distressing word or a neutral word with a thermometer at both sides. The thermometer displayed the change in brain activation and was updated every 2 s. \n  \nOne bar on the thermometer display corresponded to 0.2% signal change in the PCC, consisting of an upper activation range with a maximum of 2.8% signal change and a lower activation range with a maximum of 1.2% signal change (Paret et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). Participants were instructed to visually focus on the word during its entire presentation and to view the two thermometers in their peripheral vision. Emotion\u2010induction effects of personalized stimuli were confirmed both on the subjective experience level via inspection of RSDI scores and on the neurobiological level by contrasting   view   as compared to   neutral   conditions (see results section below). Participants were also informed of the temporal delay that would occur during neurofeedback, corresponding to both the BOLD signal delay and real\u2010time processing of this neural activation. Finally, when a neurofeedback run was completed, individuals were asked to rate their perceived ability to regulate the target brain area. Specifically, we asked participants to rate the extent to which they were able to gain control over the neurofeedback signal, which ranged from 0 (not at all) to 6 (a great deal). \n\n\n### Real\u2010time signal processing for neurofeedback \n  \nAnatomical scans were first imported into BrainVoyager (Brain Innovations, Maastrict, the Netherlands), skull\u2010stripped, and then transformed into Talairach space. Normalization parameters were then loaded into TurboBrainVoyager (TBV) (Brain Innovations, Maastricht, the Netherlands). Motion correction features and spatial smoothing using a 4\u2010mm full\u2010width\u2010half\u2010maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel were implemented in TBV, and the initial 2 volumes of the functional scans were discarded before real\u2010time processing. We defined the target PCC using a 6 mm sphere over the following coordinate (MNI: 0 \u201050 20) (Bluhm et\u00a0al.,  ). We used the \u201cbest voxel selection\u201d tool in TBV to calculate the BOLD signal amplitude in the PCC. This tool identifies the 33% most active voxels for the   view   >   neutral   contrast. Further details on dynamic ROI definitions can be found in our previous publications (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). The first two trials of each neurofeedback run consisted of   view   and   neutral   conditions thereby allowing for initial selection of PCC voxels based on the   view   >   neutral   contrast, which was dynamically updated as voxels selection was refined along the course of training. For each trial, the mean of the last 4 data points before stimuli onset (during the implicit resting state) were selected as a baseline and indicated to participants as an orange line on the thermometer display. The signal was smoothed by calculating the mean of the current and the preceding 3 data points (Paret et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\n\n### fMRI image acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nNeuroimaging was conducted using a 3 Tesla MRI Scanner at the Lawson Health Research Institute (Siemens Biograph mMR, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32\u2010channel head coil, where during scanning participants\u2019 heads were stabilized. Functional whole brain images of the BOLD contrast were acquired with a gradient echo T2*\u2010weighted echo\u2010planar\u2010imaging sequence (TE\u00a0= 30 ms, TR\u00a0= 2 s, FOV\u00a0= 192\u00a0\u00d7 192 mm, flip angle\u00a0= 80\u00b0, inplane resolution\u00a0= 3\u00a0\u00d7 3 mm). One volume comprised 36 ascending interleaved slices tilted \u221220\u00b0 from AC\u2010PC orientation with a thickness of 3 mm and slice gap of 1 mm. The experimental runs comprised 284 volumes each, where T1\u2010weighted anatomical images were acquired with a Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo sequence (TE\u00a0= 3.03 ms, TR\u00a0= 2.3 s, 192 slices and FOV\u00a0= 256\u00a0\u00d7 256 mm). \n\nPreprocessing of the functional images was performed with SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) within MATLAB R2020a. Our standard preprocessing routine included discarding 4 initial volumes, slice time correction to the middle slice, reorientation to the AC\u2010PC axis, spatial alignment to the mean image using a rigid body transformation, reslicing, and coregistration of the functional mean image to the subject's anatomical image. The coregistered images were segmented using the \u201cNew Segment\u201d method implemented in SPM12. The functional images were normalized to MNI space (Montr\u00e9al Neurological Institute) and were smoothed with a FWHM Gaussian kernel of 6 mm. Additional correction for motion was implemented using the ART software package (Gabrieli Lab, McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Cambridge, MA), which computes regressors that account for outlier volumes. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \n#### First\u2010level analysis \n  \nWe defined separate sessions for each neurofeedback training run and the transfer run, where all events (initial rest, instructions, fixation, and conditions) were modeled as blocks of brain activation and convolved with the hemodynamic response function. In the first level, functional data were also high\u2010pass filtered and serial correlations were accounted for using an autoregressive model. Additionally, ART software regressors were included as nuisance variables to account for any additional movement and outlier artifacts. The three experimental conditions (  regulate, view, and neutral  ) were modeled separately on the first level. \n\n\n#### Second\u2010level analyses \n  \nWe first conducted a split\u2010plot full factorial 2 (group) by 3 (condition) by 3 (NFB training run) ANOVA within SPM12 to investigate changes in whole\u2010brain activation, inputting separate condition specific contrast images generated in the first level. As we were specifically interested in differential activation during the   regulate   and   view   conditions (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ;  ), we examined follow\u2010up comparisons focusing on between condition effects within group, as well as between groups comparing the PTSD and healthy control groups. We then examined the transfer run separately, where we conducted a 2 (group) by 3 (condition) ANOVA and subsequently examined aforementioned direct follow\u2010up comparisons. All analyses were whole\u2010brain corrected for multiple comparisons using a clusterwise false discovery rate (FDR) threshold at   p   < .05,   k  \u00a0= 10, with an initial clustering defining threshold in SPM at   p   < .001,   k  \u00a0= 10 (Eklund et\u00a0al.,  ; Roiser et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nFinally, we conducted linear regression analyses across all subjects, examining potential correlations between trait\u2010based symptoms and whole\u2010brain activation during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions over NFB training runs. Here, we examined PTSD symptom severity scores (CAPS\u20105 total), difficulty in emotion regulation scores (DERS total), and depressive symptoms (BDI total). \n\n\n#### Neurofeedback PCC downregulation analysis \n  \nIn order to evaluate PCC downregulation (neurofeedback success), we extracted the event\u2010related BOLD response (peristimulus time histogram) from the PCC target area during the   regulate   and the   view   conditions using rfxplot software (Gl\u00e4scher,  ), using the same sphere definition that was used to generate feedback for participants in the fMRI scanner. Here, we extracted the event\u2010related BOLD response from individual peaks within the search volume, and these values were\u00a0then passed to SPSS (v.26) for statistical analyses. Within rfxplot software, event\u2010related BOLD responses display the average height of the BOLD responses within a defined volume and time window (Gl\u00e4scher,  ). Rfxplot shows the actual data and does not rely on first\u2010 or second\u2010level models. Event\u2010related BOLD responses are estimated by a condition\u2010specific Finite Impulse Response (FIR) model (Gl\u00e4scher,  ). Here, the condition duration in which the BOLD response is expected to fluctuate is parcellated into temporal bins (TR\u00a0= 2 s) starting at the onset of all trials belonging to a particular condition. The parameter estimate for each bin of the FIR model is identical to the mean BOLD response in that bin, thus creating an event\u2010related BOLD time course for each subject. For the final display (Figure\u00a0 ), rfxplot averages subject\u2010specific event\u2010related BOLD responses based on group. \n  \n(a) Event\u2010related BOLD response in the NFB target area (PCC), during the three training runs in the PTSD and healthy control groups. The red lines indicate PCC activation during the   regulate   condition, where the goal was to decrease activation while viewing trauma/stressful words. The green lines indicate PCC activation during the   view   condition, where participants were not attempting to decrease activation while viewing trauma/stressful words. Here, PCC activation was significantly lower during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions for NFB training runs 1\u20133, for both the PTSD and healthy control groups. (b) Event\u2010related BOLD response in the target area (PCC) during the transfer run when neurofeedback was not provided. Taken together, this demonstrates that both groups were able to gain control over downregulating their PCC with similar success. The   x  \u2010axis of the graphs indicate time over the 24 s conditions; the   y  \u2010axis indicates the event\u2010related BOLD response (peristimulus time histogram) in the target area. Shaded areas of red and green indicate standard error of the mean. Abbreviations: PCC\u00a0= posterior cingulate cortex, NFB\u00a0= neurofeedback. \n  \nFor the PTSD and healthy control groups separately, we computed repeated measures 2 (condition) by 4 (NFB run) ANOVAs. Subsequently, we then conducted a priori defined paired sample   t  \u2010tests, comparing the average BOLD response within the NFB target area between conditions for each NFB run within groups. We also conducted independent samples   t  \u2010tests comparing the average BOLD response within the NFB target area during a single NFB run for a given condition between groups. Lastly, we conducted repeated measures one\u2010way ANOVAs for the regulate condition for each group in order to examine potential learning effects across NFB training. \n\n\n#### State changes in emotional experience over neurofeedback \n  \nWe examined state changes in subjective response to traumatic/stressful stimuli over the NFB training experiment, as measured by RSDI subscales. As collected data were not normally distributed, we computed nonparametric Friedman's repeated measures ANOVAs for each group for each RSDI subscale. Here, we Bonferroni corrected our statistical threshold (  p   < .05/5\u00a0= .01) for nonparametric ANOVAs. Paired comparisons between time points were conducted using nonparametric tests for related samples (Wilcoxon signed\u2010ranks test). We then compared state symptoms across NFB runs between groups with Mann\u2013Whitney U tests. \n\n\n#### Machine learning classification analysis \n  \nWe examined the accuracy of machine learning algorithms in classifying PTSD patients as compared to healthy individuals based on whole brain activation during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions across NFB training runs. Here, we implemented L1\u2010Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) Classification algorithms within PRoNTo toolbox ( ) (Schrouff et\u00a0al.,  ) running under Matlab2020a (Mathworks, 2020). This approach has two potential benefits: (1) it can lead to improved overall generalization performance and (2) it can identify a sparse subset of relevant brain regions for the predictive model. Predictors consisted of contrast images corresponding to the   view   as compared to the   regulate   condition, where each NFB training run was inputted as a separate modality during design specification. A feature set was then prepared; NFB runs were concatenated and separate kernels were built for each modality and for each anatomical region defined by the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL, Tzourio\u2010 Mazoyer et\u00a0al., 2002) atlas. Here, an L1\u2010MKL Classifier (Schrouff et\u00a0al.,  ) was used to test if neural activation during   view   as compared to   regulate   could accurately predict group membership classification of PTSD versus healthy control. Critically, PRoNTo software implements kernel methods as a result of the high dimensionality of pattern vectors in neuroimaging data relative to the number of subjects (for more information see Schrouff et\u00a0al.,  ). We used a leave\u2010one\u2010subject\u2010out (LOSO) cross\u2010validation procedure to estimate the generalizability of our classifiers, where features were mean\u2010centered and normalized. Statistical significance of classification accuracy measures was determined via permutation testing (20,000 permutations). We then used anatomical/functional information from the AAL atlas to learn the contribution of each brain region to decision function of the machine, a function afforded by the grouping structure and the implementation of a spare version of Multiple Kernel Learning within PRoNTo toolbox (Schrouff et\u00a0al.  ). \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### PCC downregulation with neurofeedback \n  \nWe found that both patients with PTSD and healthy individuals were able to significantly downregulate their PCC during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions (Figure  ). \n\nIn summary, the average event\u2010related BOLD response within the PCC (NFB target area) was significantly lower during the   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions for all three NFB training runs (see Figure\u00a0 ), as well as for the transfer run (see Figure\u00a0 ) in both the PTSD and healthy control group, where activation during   regulate   did not differ significantly when comparing NFB runs directly. \n\nSpecifically, our 2 (condition) by 4 (NFB run) repeated measures ANOVAs yielded significant main effects of condition for analyses conducted within the PTSD group (  F  (1, 13)\u00a0= 37.6,   p   < .0001, \u03b7 \u00a0= .743) and within the control group (  F  (1, 14)\u00a0= 33.67,   p   < .0001, \u03b7 \u00a0= .706). We found nonsignificant main effects of NFB run and nonsignificant interactions for both groups. Next, follow\u2010up paired sample   t  \u2010tests demonstrated that the average event\u2010related BOLD response during the   regulate   condition was significantly lower than the   view   condition for all NFB training runs and the transfer run, for both the PTSD group (NFB run 1:   t  (13)\u00a0= \u22123.50,   p  \u00a0= .004; NFB run 2:   t  (13)\u00a0= \u22123.00,   p  \u00a0= .011; NFB run 3:   t  (13)\u00a0= \u22123.71,   p  \u00a0= .003; transfer run:   t  (13)\u00a0= \u22123.50,   p  \u00a0= .004) and the healthy control group (NFB run 1:   t  (14)\u00a0= \u22123.63,   p  \u00a0= .003; NFB run 2:   t  (14)\u00a0= \u22125.43,   p   < .0001; NFB run 3:   t  (14)\u00a0= \u22125.77,   p   < .0001; transfer run:   t  (14)\u00a0= \u22123.21,   p  \u00a0= .006). Interestingly, when comparing each condition during a respective NFB run and during the transfer run between groups, we found nonsignificant differences in the average event\u2010related BOLD response during the   regulate   and   view   conditions between PTSD and healthy control groups. When conducting the same analysis but investigating the difference in BOLD response between the   regulate   and   view   conditions between PTSD and healthy control groups, we also found nonsignificant differences between groups. Indeed, this implies that both experimental groups were able to gain control over downregulating their PCC with similar success. However, as demonstrated below, the neural mechanisms by which the regulation was achieved is starkly different. Finally, when examining repeated measures one\u2010way ANOVAS for   regulate   trials over the NFB runs, we report nonsignificant main effects of run for both the PTSD and healthy control groups. Please see the supplementary materials section (Figure  ) for plots of the event\u2010related BOLD response within the PCC NFB target region during all conditions (  neutral  ,   view  , and   regulate  ). \n\nWhen evaluating perceived ability to regulate the neurofeedback signal, our 2 (group) by 4 (run) split\u2010plot repeated measured ANOVA revealed a nonsignificant group by run interaction, where the PTSD and healthy control groups did not differ significantly when comparing each run directly (PTSD:   M  \u00a0= 2.5,   SD   \u00b11.42; healthy control group:   M  \u00a0= 2.83,   SD   \u00b11.21; perceived ability to regulate scale 0\u00a0= not at all, 6\u00a0= a great deal). Additionally, within\u2010group comparisons of subjective ratings on ability to regulate the neurofeedback signal at run 1 versus run 4 were found to be nonsignificant. \n\n\n### Differential mechanisms of PCC downregulation: Neural activation analysis \n  \nOur split\u2010plot ANOVA revealed a significant group by condition by NFB run interaction within the right dlPFC (see Table\u00a0 ). This fortified the examination of our subsequent a priori planned comparisons. Here, we focused on investigation around the difference between the   regulate   and   view   conditions. Importantly, however, when examining neural activation during   view   as compared to   neutral   conditions across all participants, we found significant activation within the PCC/precuneus (NFB target area), the left anterior insula, the bilateral cerebellum (lobule VI and Crus I/II), the left dmPFC, and the left angular gyrus (see supplemental material Table  ). These findings confirm increased neural activation within the NFB target region (PCC) as a result of the emotion induction paradigm and provide construct validity to the current investigation in both the PTSD and healthy control groups. \n  \n2 (Group)\u00a0\u00d7 3 (condition)\u00a0\u00d7 3 (NFB Run) split plot ANOVA \n    \nWhen examining NFB training runs within groups, during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions, the PTSD group showed expected decreases in the PCC/precuneus target area, as well as concomitant decreases in the bilateral dmPFC, the left postcentral gyrus, the right temporal pole, the mid\u2010cingulate cortex, the left amygdala/hippocampus, and the right superior temporal gyrus (see Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). When analyzing NFB training runs during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions, the healthy control group also showed expected decreases in the PCC/precuneus target area, in addition to concomitant decreases in the bilateral postcentral gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus, and the left superior temporal gyrus (see Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). Additionally, the healthy control group exhibited increased activation during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions within the right dlPFC. Interestingly, direct group comparisons revealed that the healthy control group displayed increased right dlPFC activation relative to the PTSD group during   regulate   conditions as compared to   view   conditions (see Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nNeurofeedback training direct comparisons \n      \nNeural dynamics during NFB training of PCC downregulation.

Abbreviations: NFB\u00a0= neurofeedback, PCC\u00a0= posterior cingulate cortex, dlPFC\u00a0= dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. \n  \nWhen examining neural activation during the transfer run within group, during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions, the healthy control group displayed decreased precuneus/PCC and right postcentral gyrus activation (see Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). During the transfer run, we found nonsignificant differences between the   regulate   and   view   conditions within the PTSD group and when comparing these conditions in the transfer run between the PTSD and healthy control groups at a conservative FDR\u2010corrected threshold. Notably, when age was included as covariate, the aformentioned neural activation results were not significantly affected. \n  \nTransfer run direct comparisons \n    \n\n### Clinical correlations with neural activation \n  \nWhen evaluating associations between neural activation and clinical measures with linear regression analyses, we found that PTSD severity scores (CAPS total) positively correlated with left anterior insula and right cerebellum (lobule VI/Crus I) activation during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions (see Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). In other words, the higher the PTSD symptoms, the more the left anterior insula and the right cerebellum (lobule VI/Crus I) was activated during the viewing of trauma/stressful words as compared to regulating the PCC while viewing these words. Additionally, PTSD severity scores (CAPS total) negatively correlated to activation in the right dlPFC during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions. Hence, the more the dlPFC was activated during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions, the less severe the PTSD symptoms. Considering significant correlations observed with CAPS\u2010total scores, we then conducted follow\u2010up post hoc linear regression analyses with scores related to the severity of intrusion symptoms (CAPS\u20105 cluster B), severity of negative alterations in cognitions and mood (CAPS\u20105 cluster D), and severity of arousal and reactivity symptoms (CAPS\u20105 cluster E). Here, similar positive correlations were found with the bilateral anterior insula and the right cerebellum (lobule VI/Crus I) during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions, as well as negative correlations with right dlPFC activation during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions. \n  \nNeurofeedback training multiple regression analysis \n      \nThe upper portion of the figure shows correlations between PTSD severity scores (CAPS total) and brain activation during NFB training. The lower portion of the figure illustrates correlations between difficulties in emotion regulation (DERS total) and brain activation during NFB training. Red clusters indicate positive correlations during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions. Blue clusters indicate negative correlations during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions. During NFB training, the more severe the PTSD symptoms, the more the left anterior insula and the right cerebellum (lobule VI/Crus I) was activated during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions. Additionally, the more the dlPFC was activated during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions over NFB training, the less severe the PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, the more difficult it was for participants to regulate their emotions, the more the anterior insula was activated during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions. Finally, the more dlPFC activation during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions over NFB training, the less difficulties participants had with emotion regulation. Results evaluated at the FDR\u2010cluster corrected level for multiple comparisons (  p   < .05,   k  \u00a0= 10). NFB\u00a0= neurofeedback, dlPFC\u00a0= dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. \n  \nAdditionally, we found a positive correlation between difficulty in emotion regulation scores (DERS total) and the right anterior insula during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions (see Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 ). In other words, the more difficult it was for participants to regulate their emotions, the more the anterior insula was activated during the viewing of trauma/stressful words as compared to regulating the PCC while viewing these words. Furthermore, difficulty in emotion regulation was negatively correlated to right dlPFC activation during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions. Indeed, the more dlPFC activation during   regulate  , the less difficulties participants had in emotion regulation. \n\n\n### State changes in emotional experience over neurofeedback \n  \nIn summary, when examining state changes in emotional experience over NFB training in response to trauma/stressful stimuli presentation, we found that the PTSD and healthy control groups demonstrated significant reductions in reliving symptoms, where additionally, the PTSD group demonstrated significant reductions on distress symptoms as measured by the RSDI Scale (see Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nWhen examining state changes in emotional experience over NFB training in response to trauma/stressful stimuli presentation, we found that the PTSD and healthy control groups demonstrated significant reductions on reliving symptoms, where additionally, the PTSD group demonstrated significant reductions on distress symptoms as measured by the RSDI Scale. Abbreviations: NFB\u00a0= neurofeedback, RSDI\u00a0= Response to Script Driven Imagery Scale. \n  \nSpecifically, the PTSD group showed a significant main effect of run for the nonparametric ANOVA examining symptoms of reliving (  \u03c7  (3)\u00a0= 11.49,\u00a0  p  \u00a0= .009). Follow\u2010up Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank tests revealed that NFB run 3 had lower scores of reliving than NFB run 1 (  p  \u00a0= .016). Similarly, the control group demonstrated a significant main effect of run examining symptoms of reliving (  \u03c7  (3)\u00a0= 18.24,   p   < .0001). Follow\u2010up tests revealed that NFB runs 3 (  p =   .008) and 4 (  p =   .010) had significantly lower scores of reliving than NFB run 1. Finally, the PTSD group also displayed a significant main effect of run for symptoms of distress (  \u03c7  (3)\u00a0= 13.79,\u00a0  p =   .003). Follow\u2010up tests showed that distress symptoms during NFB run 3 (  p =   .010) and 4 (  p =   .013) were significantly lower than NFB run 1. Symptoms of physical reactions, dissociation and numbing did not significantly decrease over NFB runs. Furthermore, as expected, when comparing state symptoms across NFB runs between groups with Mann\u2013Whitney U tests, the PTSD group always demonstrated higher levels of symptoms as compared to the healthy control group, even for symptoms of distress and reliving which decreased significantly over NFB runs for the PTSD group. \n\n\n### Machine learning classification analysis \n  \nSupporting differential mechanisms associated with PCC downregulation in PTSD versus healthy individuals (i.e., psychopathological specificity), machine learning algorithms were able to classify participants based on NFB brain activation during the   view   as compared to   regulate   condition during training runs with 80% accuracy (ROC\u00a0= 0.85,   p  \u00a0< .001 permutation testing). The class predictive value was 83.33% for the PTSD group and 76.47% for the healthy control group. Additionally, the class accuracy was 71.43% for the PTSD group and 86.67% for the healthy control group. The highest\u2010ranking ROIs used by the decision function of the machine were bilateral the dlPFC, the bilateral dmPFC, the bilateral vmPFC, and the PCC, which provides converging evidence of our univariate between group results. Here, the MKL models were indeed quite sparse, with nine regions having a nonnull contribution across folds. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn summary, we found that both the PTSD and healthy control groups were able to downregulate their PCC with similar success in terms of average event\u2010related BOLD response within the NFB target area, which remained stable over NFB training and into the post\u2010training transfer run. With regard to state changes in emotional experience over NFB training, both the PTSD and healthy control groups demonstrated reduced reliving symptoms in response to trauma/stressful stimuli. Additionally, the PTSD group demonstrated significantly reduced distress symptoms over NFB training and into the post\u2010training transfer run. Interestingly, PCC NFB training was concomitantly associated with unique within\u2010group downregulation of activity (  regulate < view  ) within the dorsomedial PFC, postcentral gyrus, amygdala/hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and temporal pole/gyri. Interestingly, downregulating the PCC during NFB training was associated with greater activation (  regulate > view)   in the right dlPFC among healthy individuals as compared to those with PTSD. In support of this, increased activation in the right dlPFC during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions was negatively correlated to PTSD symptom severity scores and difficulties in emotion regulation. Furthermore, stronger activation in the anterior insula and cerebellum (lobule VI/crus I) during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions was positively associated with PTSD symptoms. \n\nSupporting differential mechanisms associated with PCC downregulation in PTSD versus healthy individuals, machine learning models were able to classify participants based on brain activation during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions   during NFB training runs   with 80% accuracy. Here, the highest\u2010ranking ROIs used by the decision function of the machine were the bilateral dlPFC, the bilateral dmPFC, the bilateral vmPFC, and the PCC, which provides converging evidence of our univariate between group results. \n\n### PCC neurofeedback decreased reliving and distress symptoms \n  \nWithin both the PTSD and healthy control groups, the BOLD response within the PCC search volume (NFB target area) was found to be significantly lower during the   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions for all three NFB training runs and the transfer run, where PCC activation during   regulate   did not differ significantly when comparing NFB runs. Direct comparisons of regulation success did not yield significant between group differences, suggesting that PTSD and healthy individuals can similarly gain control over this brain region via rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB. Further demonstrating the strength of the current results, at the whole\u2010brain FDR\u2010corrected level, both groups showed decreased activation within clusters spanning the PCC/precuneus during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions over NFB\u2010training. Interestingly, these whole\u2010brain results extended to the transfer run only for the healthy control group, where additional training sessions/statistical power may be required to observe this transfer run effect in the PTSD group at our conservative statistical threshold (FDR   p   <.05). The PCC and precuneus are major hubs of the DMN, where DMN functional disruptions in PTSD are associated with traumatic/negative autobiographical memories, distorted and dysregulated self\u2010referential processing, and alterations in social cognition (Bluhm et\u00a0al.,  ; Daniels et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Tursich et\u00a0al.,  ; Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ; Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ; Hinojosa et\u00a0al.,  ; Frewen et\u00a0al.,  ; Terpou et\u00a0al.,  ). Indeed, traumatic imagery tasks in PTSD have been found to induce hyperactivation in the PCC (Awasthi et\u00a0al.,  ) and in the precuneus (Ramage et\u00a0al.,  ), where it has been suggested that suboptimal downregulation of the PCC and DMN may underscore difficulties in disengaging from internally focused self\u2010referential processing (Aupperle et\u00a0al.,  ). A recent meta\u2010analysis has also found that both reexperiencing and retrieval of trauma\u2010related autobiographical memories are associated with enhanced activation within the PCC and other DMN regions among individuals with PTSD (Thome et\u00a0al.,  ). In line with these findings, we found increased PCC activation during   view   as compared to   neutral   conditions in the current study. Notably, NFB training of PCC downregulation resulted in concomitant decreases in reliving symptoms among those with PTSD and healthy individuals, with additional decreases in distress symptoms in the PTSD group. As expected, between\u2010group comparisons revealed that reliving and distress symptoms were higher in the PTSD group as compared to the healthy control group. In support of associations between PCC downregulation and reductions in symptoms, longitudinal improvements in PTSD symptoms in response to trauma\u2010focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have been found to be associated with decreased PCC activation in youth with PTSD during emotion\u2010processing tasks (Garrett et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nConsistent with the current results, one session of alpha rhythm EEG\u2010NFB has been shown previously to lead to acute decreases in arousal symptoms among PTSD patients and normalize both DMN and amygdala resting\u2010state functional connectivity patterns (Kluetsch et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). Additionally, during a 20\u2010week randomized controlled trial of alpha\u2010based EEG\u2010NFB in PTSD (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ), individuals in the experimental group demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions on PTSD severity scores post\u2010NFB and at 3\u2010month follow\u2010up, which were associated with a shift towards normalization of DMN resting\u2010state functional connectivity. \n\n\n### NFB\u2010induced whole\u2010brain regulation and correlations with symptoms \n  \nWhen examining whole\u2010brain BOLD response during PCC NFB training runs, with respect to   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions, the   PTSD group   showed decreased activity in the bilateral dmPFC, the mid\u2010cingulate cortex, and the left amygdala/hippocampus. Previously, the presentation of trauma\u2010versus\u2010neutral words has been shown to be related to increased activation within the DMN (the PCC and mPFC) and the SN (the PAG and BNST), as compared to decreased activation in the CEN involved in emotion regulation (the dlPFC) when comparing PTSD and healthy controls (Awasthi et\u00a0al.,  ). In the same study, PTSD symptom severity was positively correlated with neural activation during trauma\u2010versus\u2010neutral words within the DMN (the PCC and hippocampus) and the SN (the amygdala and BNST) and negatively correlated with CEN activation (the dlPFC). This is supported by previous research examining PTSD brain correlates during both script\u2010driven imagery and the recall of trauma\u2010related autobiographical memories in PTSD (Hopper et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ; Frewen et\u00a0al.,  ; Mickleborough et\u00a0al.,  ; Ramage et\u00a0al.,  ; Liberzon and Abelson,  ; Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ; Thome et\u00a0al.,  ). Interestingly, in the current study, we found evidence to suggest that downregulating the PCC during trauma word presentation resulted in a normalization of this PTSD neural signature, with decreased activation in aforementioned DMN regions involved in self\u2010related and autobiographical memory processing (bilateral dmPFC and hippocampus) as well as in SN areas involved in emotional arousal, emotion evaluation, salience monitoring and innate fight\u2010or\u2010flight defensive responses (amygdala and mid\u2010cingulate cortex) (Liddell et\u00a0al.,  ; Etkin et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  , 2017; Fitzgerald et\u00a0al.,  ; Hinojosa et\u00a0al.,  ). Activation in the dmPFC occurs during self\u2010related emotion processing and exposure to negative content, and additionally, is involved in evaluating self\u2010related emotional experience (Fitzgerald et\u00a0al.,  ). Moreover, the dmPFC has been shown generally to subserve functions related to the appraisal and expression of fear and anxiety (Etkin et\u00a0al.,  ). Recent meta\u2010analyses have also reported that the mid\u2010cingulate cortex is hyperactive in PTSD, with both correlations to PTSD severity and trauma exposure (Hayes et\u00a0al.,  ; Patel et\u00a0al.,  ; Hinojosa et\u00a0al.,  ). Furthermore, several studies have found evidence of enhanced hippocampal engagement during exposure to trauma\u2010specific images, as well as increased activation during reexperiencing and retrieval of trauma\u2010related autobiographical memories (Hou et\u00a0al.,  ; Nilsen et\u00a0al.,  ; Fitzgerald et\u00a0al.,  ; Thome et\u00a0al.,  ). With respect to the amygdala, due to its hyperactivity in close association with symptoms of PTSD and hyperarousal (Hayes et\u00a0al.,  ; Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ; Fitzgerald et\u00a0al.,  ; Henigsberg et\u00a0al.,  ) and its involvement with the innate alarm system in the salient detection of threat (Liddell et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ), this limbic region has been a frequent target of previous rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB studies in PTSD (Gerin et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Misaki et\u00a0al.,  ,  ; Zotev et\u00a0al.,  ; Chiba et\u00a0al.,  ). Indeed, it has been shown recently that high treatment response among PTSD patients is characterized by less amygdala\u2010PCC connectivity at rest (Sheynin et\u00a0al.,  ). Taken together, results from the current study suggest that regulating the PCC not only results in gaining control over other DMN structures (dmPFC, hippocampus) but also results in the downregulation of SN structures (amygdala, mid\u2010cingulate) that have been shown previously to be hyperactive and tied to PTSD symptoms during trauma\u2010provocation. \n\nBetween\u2010group comparisons revealed increased right dlPFC activation in the healthy control group relative to the PTSD group during   regulate   conditions as compared to   view   conditions. In support of this, increased activation in the right dlPFC during   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions was negatively correlated to global PTSD symptom severity scores (as well as intrusion, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and arousal symptom clusters) and difficulties in emotion regulation. In other words, the more dlPFC activation during   regulate   conditions, the less PTSD symptoms and less difficulties in emotion regulation. As mentioned previously, recent studies have shown decreased dlPFC activation in PTSD during the presentation of trauma\u2010versus\u2010neutral words as compared to healthy controls (Awasthi et\u00a0al.,  ), where hypoactivation within this region has been commonly associated with PTSD symptoms (Pitman et\u00a0al.,  ; Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ; Fitzgerald et\u00a0al.,  ; Holmes et\u00a0al.,  ). Critically, we have shown previously that amygdala downregulation training with rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB leads to both increased dlPFC activation and increased recruitment of the CEN during emotion induction paradigms (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ,  ). Zotev et\u00a0al. (2018) showed that 3\u2010sessions of amygdala training with rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB lead to reductions in PTSD severity that correlated with enhanced functional connectivity between the amygdala and dlPFC. In the same data set, a connectome\u2010wide investigation revealed that increased resting\u2010state connectivity between the left dlPFC and the precuneus was correlated with PTSD symptom reductions in hyperarousal after the three NFB training sessions (Misaki et\u00a0al.,  ). Indeed, future studies are warranted to investigate if multiple sessions of PCC downregulation with rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB would also result in increased dlPFC recruitment among individuals with PTSD and if this neural response mediates PTSD symptoms. \n\nIn addition to dlPFC activation being negatively correlated with PTSD symptoms, our results also revealed that activation in the anterior insula during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions was positively associated with global PTSD symptom severity scores (as well as negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and arousal symptom clusters) and difficulties in emotion regulation. Previously, the anterior insula has been shown to be hyperactive in PTSD with positive correlations to symptoms of reexperiencing; in addition, this area also displays aberrant functional connectivity patterns during the resting\u2010state in PTSD (Hopper et\u00a0al.,  ; Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ; Fenster et\u00a0al.,  ; Harricharan et\u00a0al.,  ). It has been suggested that increased anterior insula activity may coincide with enhanced salience processing of environmental cues and PTSD symptoms of hypervigilance, hyperarousal, and reexperiencing (Hopper et\u00a0al.,  ; Patel et\u00a0al.,  ; Koch et\u00a0al.,  ; Akiki et\u00a0al.,  ). Our recent randomized clinical trial of alpha rhythm EEG\u2010NFB over 20 weeks also revealed decreased anterior insula connectivity with the salience network after NFB intervention (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ). In support of these findings, a recent review also suggests that treatment response in PTSD is associated with lower functional activity and connectivity within the anterior insula (Szeszko & Yehuda,  ). Furthermore, activation in the right cerebellum (lobule VI/crus I) during   view   as compared to   regulate   conditions was positively correlated to global PTSD symptom severity scores (as well as intrusion, and negative alterations in cognitions and mood symptom clusters). Indeed, lobule VI/crus I regions of the posterior cerebellum are dedicated to cognitive and executive functions, working memory, visuospatial functions, and limbic system processing (Stoodley and Schmahmann,  ) and have been shown previously to be associated with PTSD symptomatology (Rabellino et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\nCommon to both groups was the downregulation of various regions in the postcentral gyri, the temporal gyri, and the temporal pole during   regulate   conditions as compared to   view   conditions. The postcentral gyrus represents the primary somatosensory cortex and plays a crucial role in somatosensory representations linked to the perception of emotional and sensory experience (Kragel & LaBar,  ; Cao et\u00a0al.,  ). This is in line with a body of literature that suggests that emotions are represented in the somatosensory system as categorically distinct somatotopic maps associated with unique bodily sensations (Nummenmaa et\u00a0al.,  ). Critically, the postcentral gyrus, along with the superior, mid, and inferior temporal gyri, has been shown to be implicated in the innate alarm system involved in the ultrafast salient detection of danger (Liddell et\u00a0al.,  ; Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ). In relation, the temporal pole is a paralimbic region that is highly interconnected with the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex and is involved in both sensory and limbic processing underlying emotional states (i.e., affective processing) (Olson et\u00a0al.,  ). Previously, we have shown that the temporal pole is hyperconnected to the salience network at rest among PTSD patients as compared to healthy individuals (Nicholson et\u00a0al.,  ), where the temporal pole has also been shown to be activated during trauma\u2010related autobiographical memory recall and correlated to PTSD symptoms of reexperiencing (Frewen et\u00a0al.,  ; Thome et\u00a0al.,  ). Interestingly, the temporoparietal junction, which includes the posterior superior temporal gyrus, is critical for multisensory integration, bodily self\u2010consciousness, and embodiment (Arzy et\u00a0al.,  ; Blanke,  ; Igelstr\u00f6m et\u00a0al.,  ). Additionally, the superior, inferior, and mid\u2010temporal gyri have been shown to display increased activation in response to trauma\u2010related stimuli and have been correlated to PTSD symptoms of avoidance and dissociation (Lanius et\u00a0al.,  ; Hopper et\u00a0al.,  ; Nilsen et\u00a0al.,  ). Indeed, it has been shown recently that PCC and middle temporal gyrus connectivity negatively correlate with PTSD severity and reexperiencing (Sheynin et\u00a0al.,  ). Although speculative, results from the current study suggest that while downregulating the PCC with NFB during the presentation of trauma stimuli, individuals are also gaining control over the sensory\u2010experience of their trauma\u2010related emotions that are mapped within the somatosensory system. Furthermore, our results also suggest that PCC downregulation results in concomitantly gaining control over temporal lobe regions highly associated with PTSD symptoms, in addition to embodiment, and sensory/limbic processing of emotional states. \n\nFinally, during the transfer run, we found nonsignificant whole\u2010brain activation differences between   regulate   and   view   conditions within the PTSD group and when comparing these conditions between the PTSD and healthy control groups. Nevertheless, within the transfer run, the healthy control group displayed decreased precuneus/PCC and right postcentral gyrus activation during the transfer run for the   regulate   as compared to   view   conditions. This may represent more sustained downregulation effects and optimized NFB learning among healthy controls, as these areas are also shown to be downregulated during the NFB training. Future studies are warranted to investigate if multiple sessions of PCC downregulation with rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB would also result in these sustained transfer run effects within the PTSD group. \n\n\n### Future directions and limitations \n  \nMoving forward, future investigations should examine the combined effects of multiple sessions of NFB\u2010training with respect to PCC downregulation, as well as collect follow\u2010up measures in order to examine sustained effects of this intervention. Functional and effective connectivity analyses of the PCC are also warranted. Furthermore, future studies should examine unique responses to treatment among heterogeneous presentations of PTSD, including the dissociative subtype and complex PTSD diagnoses. In the current study, the influence of past psychotherapy and psychotropic medication on neurofeedback training success was not evaluated. Future studies are needed to examine both the interactive effect of neurofeedback and psychotherapy/psychotropic medication, as well as the use of neurofeedback as an adjunctive treatment for PTSD. Lastly, ideally powered randomized controlled trials with comparisons to sham\u2010NFB and mental rehearsal conditions are also required (Sorger et\u00a0al.,  ). \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nIn summary, we found that both the PTSD and healthy control groups were able to downregulate the PCC with similar success over NFB training and in the transfer run. Indeed, both the PTSD and healthy control groups demonstrated reduced reliving symptoms in response to trauma/stressful stimuli, where the PTSD group additionally demonstrated significantly reduced distress symptoms over NFB training. Here, PCC downregulation was associated with unique within\u2010group   decreases   in activation within the dmPFC, postcentral gyrus, amygdala/hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and temporal pole/middle and superior temporal gyri. By contrast, downregulation was associated with   increased   activation in the right dlPFC among healthy controls as compared to PTSD. During PCC downregulation, right dlPFC activation was negatively correlated to PTSD symptom severity scores and difficulties in emotion regulation. Moreover, anterior insula and cerebellum (lobule VI/crus I) activation was positively correlated to PTSD symptoms. Finally, machine learning algorithms were able to classify participants based on brain activation during NFB training with 80% accuracy. Importantly, this is the first study to investigate PCC downregulation with real\u2010time fMRI NFB in PTSD. Taken together, our results reveal acute decreases in symptoms during PCC NFB training and provide converging evidence for alpha EEG\u2010NFB targeting brain networks linked to the PCC. Future clinical trials of rt\u2010fMRI\u2010NFB investigating PCC downregulation in PTSD are warranted to leverage the effects of multiple training sessions. \n\n\n\n### PEER REVIEW \n  \nThe peer

In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, we used blood\u2212oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate if sex-steroid hormone manipulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) influences emotional processing. Fifty-six healthy women were investigated twice: at baseline (follicular phase of menstrual cycle) and 16\u00b13 days post intervention. At both sessions, fMRI-scans during exposure to faces expressing fear, anger, happiness or no emotion, depressive symptom scores and estradiol levels were acquired. The fMRI analyses focused on regions of interest for emotional processing. As expected, GnRHa initially increased and subsequently reduced estradiol to menopausal levels, which was accompanied by an increase in subclinical depressive symptoms relative to placebo. Women who displayed larger GnRHa-induced increase in depressive symptoms had a larger increase in both negative and positive emotion-elicited activity in the anterior insula. When considering the post-GnRHa scan only, depressive responses were associated with emotion-elicited activity in the anterior insula and amygdala. The effect on regional activity in anterior insula was not associated with the estradiol net decline, only by the GnRHa-induced changes in mood. Our data implicate enhanced insula recruitment during emotional processing in the emergence of depressive symptoms following sex-hormone fluctuations. This may correspond to the emotional hypersensitivity frequently experienced by women postpartum. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMood disorders are among the most common causes for disability and constitute a major and severe public health problem.  The prevalence is twice as high in women relative to men.  Postpartum depression, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and major depression with onset in the menopausal transition phase are examples of mood disorders coinciding with fluctuations, or a rapid decline, in sex-steroid hormone levels. The mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not well understood, but may be related to neurobiological effects of changes in ovarian sex steroids, in particular estradiol. \n\nAltered processing of emotional stimuli has been recognised as a core cognitive abnormality in mood disorders, including major depression, postpartum depression and PMDD.  Comparisons across menstrual cycle phases, associated with subtle variations in sex-steroid hormone levels, that is, the follicular versus luteal phases, have also suggested phase-specific variations in emotional processing.  However, those studies offer no consensus with respect to the pattern of brain regions recruited differently across menstrual cycle phases. Further, chronic states of ovarian sex-steroid hormone downregulation, that is, with hormonal contraception, have been associated with blunted amygdala responses to negatively valenced emotional stimuli suggesting that such longer-term ovarian hormone deprivation might evoke changes in emotional processing. \n\nIn addition to the coupling between sex-steroid hormones, emotional processing and mood, this study is motivated by frequent reports of a relationship between serotonergic transmission and emotional processing  since sex steroids and serotonin interact. This interaction is supported in particular by rodent and non-human primate work of Bethea   et al.  \n\nHere we studied emotional processing before and after manipulating ovarian sex-steroid hormone production by intervention with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) Goserelin. When administered continuously, GnRHa initially stimulates and subsequently, after ~2 weeks, downregulates ovarian hormone production, in particular estradiol, by desensitising GnRH receptors at the level of the pituitary gland. As this intervention induces a transient fluctuation in ovarian hormones in healthy women, it can serve as a model for studying the neurobiological correlates of such a fluctuation and its potential coupling to behavioural or psychological responses. Using blood\u2212oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we mapped functional brain activation in emotion-related regions during implicit (gender labelling) emotional processing of faces expressing fear, anger, happiness and no emotion. Functional brain activity was measured with fMRI at baseline and after intervention with either GnRHa or placebo. The post-intervention session was placed shortly after the biphasic GnRHa response in the early suppression phase as motivated by studies documenting that risk for depression in perimenopause is particularly associated with fluctuations in estradiol  and peaks early (day 10\u201319) postpartum.  We hypothesised that GnRHa would induce changes in depressive symptoms in a manner dependent on estradiol changes and emotion-elicited brain activity. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants, intervention and assessment timing \n  \nParticipants were recruited by internet advertisements. Inclusion criteria comprised regular menstrual cycles (duration 23\u201335 days) for at least 3 months before inclusion, normal hormone blood tests (including follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone and androgens) and no history of neurological, gynaecological or psychiatric disorders, including PMDD, as assessed by Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN 2.1) interview, as well as neurological and gynaecological examinations including a transvaginal ultrasound of the uterus and ovaries. Participants were enroled in the baseline assessment program at a follicular phase cycle day and booked for their second ultrasound examination at cycle day 21 or 22 to assure ovulation and secure intervention timing to the midluteal phase as further detailed in Frokjaer   et al.  \n\nSixty-three healthy women participated in this randomised, placebo-controlled and double-blinded intervention study. Participants received 3.6\u2009mg GnRHa (Goserelin) implant (  n  =31) or saline injection (  n  =30) in a natural cycle during the midluteal phase (cycle day 22.7\u00b12.7). Two participants did not complete follow-up because of anovulation and pregnancy, respectively. Three did not complete the follow-up MRI session because of technical issues or personal matters. Two participants were excluded from the placebo group owing to faulty cycle timing of the MRI scan and failure to comply with the task, respectively. Thus valid fMRI data from both sessions were available for 56 women (age 24.3\u00b15.0 years), 30 in the GnRHa group and 26 in the placebo group. \n\nBaseline fMRI was acquired in the midfollicular phase (cycle day 6.0\u00b12.3) when ovarian hormone levels are most stable and the time elapsed since the postovulatory estradiol drop is maximal. Follow-up fMRI was acquired post bleeding at a time point late enough to allow the GnRHa group to have entered their early ovarian suppression phase and the placebo group to be in the follicular phase (16.0\u00b13 days after intervention). This design allowed for all researchers to be blinded. See   for an outline of the time points. The participants also performed other tasks in the scanner: the first fMRI run comprised T1-weighted imaging, resting state fMRI, a word memory fMRI paradigm, T2-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. The second fMRI run, acquired after a 40\u2009min break, comprised the emotional face fMRI paradigm reported here and a gambling fMRI paradigm. Hamilton 17-item depression rating scale and plasma concentrations of estradiol and progesterone were collected within 0\u00b12 days from the fMRI session date at baseline and follow-up. Estradiol and progesterone levels in serum were determined as specified in ref.  . Valid data on these measures were available for 29 and 26 subjects, respectively. The study was registered and approved by the local ethics committee (H-2-2010-108). After complete description of the study, written informed consent was obtained from all participants. \n\n\n### Experimental fMRI design \n  \nAt baseline and follow-up, participants performed an emotional face gender-labelling task, see ref.   and  . Subjects were to indicate the gender of photographs of faces with either fearful (F), angry (A), happy (H) or neutral (N) expressions. The different conditions were presented in blocks of six events, consisting of the block-specific expressions or null events (fixation crosses, one to three per block, pseudo-randomly intermixed). Events lasted for 1\u2009s and were interspersed with inter-stimulus fixation crosses presented for 1\u2009s. The gender response button rule (left or right for woman or man) was counterbalanced across subjects. Participants were instructed to answer as fast and as correct as possible. The testing was split up in two 7-min-long runs, each containing seven blocks of each type. All photographs were presented only once. E-prime software (Psychological Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) was used for stimulus presentation and response recordings. \n\n\n### Behavioural data analysis \n  \nBehavioural data were analysed using statistical parametric mapping software package (SPSS, version 18, Chicago, IL, USA). Potential effects of different emotional expressions on accuracy and reaction time (RT) at baseline and at post intervention were examined by means of two separate analysis of variance with emotion (F, A, H and N) as within-subject factor (for the full sample). The intervention-related changes in accuracy and RT were assessed using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with emotion (F , A  H , N ) as within-subject factor and group (GnRHa versus placebo) as between-subject factor. The Greenhouse-Geisser method was used to correct for non-sphericity when appropriate. \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nImages were acquired on a 3T Verio scanner with a 32-channel head array coil (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). For BOLD fMRI, a gradient echo based T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging sequence was used with a repetition time of 2.15\u2009s, echo time of 26\u2009ms, flip angle of 78\u00b0, and 42 slices with a slice thickness of 3\u2009mm with twofold acceleration using generalised autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions. The echo-planar imaging sequence was optimised for signal recovery in orbitofrontal cortex.  A total of 198 whole-brain volumes were acquired in each session. \n\n\n### Imaging data analysis \n  \nThe functional images were realigned, and normalised to an echo-planar imaging template in Montreal Neurological Institute stereotactic space using default SPM8 settings. The normalised images were smoothed using an isotropic 8\u2009mm Gaussian kernel. Analyses were conducted in SPM8. \n\nFor each voxel in the brain, a general linear model was constructed to model event-related changes in the BOLD signal. At the within-subject level, five event types were defined for each fMRI session, which corresponded to the presentation onsets for F, A, H and N faces, as well as null events. RTs were modelled in a separate regressor in order to control for differences in RT between different emotions. Incorrect answers were excluded. The within-subject model also included 40 nuisance regressors of no interest to account for variance in regional BOLD signal changes caused by physiological noise, including head movement and measurements of heart beat and respiration. \n\nChoosing a task where emotional faces could be contrasted with N faces enabled isolation of emotion-specific brain activity. Within the first-level general linear model, we specified 3T-contrasts that captured differences in the BOLD response to emotional as opposed to N images (F\u2212N, A\u2212N and H\u2212N, used as acronyms for the contrasts of interest hereafter) for each participant, as well as contrasts comparing the post-intervention images with the pre-intervention images (for example, post(F\u2212N)\u2212pre(F\u2212N)). Individual contrast images were entered into second-level analyses for within-group and between-group statistical comparisons. On the group-level (GnRHa versus placebo), the first contrasts were used to investigate the differential activation change from pre to post in the two groups in a flexible factorial design with group as between-subject factor and pre/post as within-subject factor. Within the GnRHa group the latter contrasts were used to investigate correlations between measures of estradiol and depressive symptoms changes from baseline on the one hand, and brain activity changes, on the other, in one-sample   t  -tests (two sided). These analyses were contingent upon active intervention, which introduced the expected biphasic estradiol change from baseline, and a main effect of group on changes in Hamilton score. \n\nIn line with results from previous studies,  there was no significant test\u2212retest correlation for amygdala activity in the placebo group for any of the contrasts of interest (correlation coefficients <0.3). This was the case also for insula activity. Because of this lack of significant test\u2212retest correlation, and because of previous findings of absolute levels of estradiol being of less importance for mood than changes in levels,  we also considered it appropriate to test for the main effect of group (GnRHa versus placebo) cross-sectionally at post intervention, as well as for a potential relationship between activity in the post-GnRHa session and estradiol and depressive symptoms changes, that is, not accounting for the baseline fMRI measures. In this way we could also test if the baseline fMRI measures were driving the observed effects. The relationship between post-GnRHa depressive symptoms and post-GnRHa brain activity was also investigated. When appropriate, the beta values of significant peaks for each subject were extracted in order to plot the value against changes in estradiol or depression scores. \n\nThe general significance level was set at   P  <0.05 for activation clusters after correction for multiple non-independent comparisons using family wise error correction. Our   a priori   primary region of interest (ROI) was the amygdala, due to the well-documented involvement in mood.  Secondary ROIs were the medial prefrontal cortex, including the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (the sum of the Frontal_Inf_Tri and Frontal_Inf_Orb) as well as insula, all defined by the Pick atlas,  based on previous reports underscoring their relevance in emotional processing.  We applied small volume correction (SVC) using SPM8 for each of the ROIs to obtain family wise error-corrected   P  -values based on Gaussian random fields. Trends are reported at the cluster-forming threshold, which was set to   P  <0.001 (unc, uncorrected) for clusters consisting of at least five voxels. \n\n\n### Analyses of estradiol measures \n  \nEstradiol decline \u2018dose-response' analyses were considered appropriate in the GnRHa group only. Changes in estradiol levels were treated as Log Estradiol \u2013Log Estradiol  because of the lack of normal distribution for the raw delta values, as previously validated.  Values below detection limit (  n  =4) were imputed to the lower detection limit: 0.04\u2009nmol\u2009l . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioural results \n  \nAs previously reported for the full sample,  Goserelin initially increased and subsequently reduced estradiol levels (from 0.18\u00b10.09 to 0.06\u00b10.04\u2009nmol\u2009l ), and led to an increase in depressive symptoms on the Hamilton 17-item scale relative to placebo (from 1.2\u00b11.6 to 3.0\u00b12.6,   P  <0.001). There was no net decline in progesterone levels from baseline to follow-up (see ref.  ). The depressive symptoms were subtle except in two participants who met the clinical criteria of a mild depressive state. The magnitude of net estradiol decrease in response to GnRHa and the emergence in depressive symptoms were positively correlated (Pearson correlation= 0.39,   P  =0.04). \n\nBoth pre- and post-intervention, facial emotion was a significant within-subject factor on measures of accuracy and RT ( ). The analyses of intervention-related changes in accuracy revealed a group by pre\u2212post interaction (F=3.0, d  f  =(3.0, 160.2),   P  =0.03), explained by an unexpected accuracy reduction (from baseline) for A and N faces in the placebo group ( ). Incorrect answers were excluded and RT was modelled in a separate regressor for the fMRI analyses. \n\n\n### Imaging results \n  \n#### Main effects of treatment group \n  \nThere was no significant main effect of treatment group (GnRHa versus placebo) nor a group by pre/post-intervention interaction for the neural response to F, A or H faces, as compared with N in any ROIs. No trends were observed for the primary ROI amygdala, but for secondary ROIs a trend (  P  <0.001) for a larger increase in left perigenual anterior cingulate cortex activity in the GnRHa group, compared with the placebo group, was present for F and A faces (  xyz  =(\u221214 38 \u22124), peak   Z  -scores=3.4). When considering only the post-intervention session, relative to the placebo group, the GnRHa group tended (  P  <0.001) to show larger activity in the left anterior insula to A faces post intervention (  xyz  =(\u201334 26 8), peak   Z  -score=3.3,   P  =not significant). \n\n\n#### Correlations with depressive responses to GnRHa intervention \n  \nWithin the GnRHa group, individual increases in depressive symptoms from baseline correlated significantly with an increased neural response in the insula ROI to F (left) and H (right) facial expressions (F\u2212N:   xyz  =(\u201332 16 0), peak   Z  -score=3.6   P  <0.05, H\u2212N:   xyz  =(34 32 6), peak   Z  -score=4.0   P  <0.001), with similar but weaker trends for H faces in the contralateral hemispheres (H\u2212N   xyz  =(\u201326 22 \u20132), peak   Z  -score =3.7,   P  <0.001) and also a trend (  P  <0.001) bilaterally for A faces (A\u2212N:   xyz  =(\u201326 26 \u20132), peak   Z  -score=3.6 and   xyz  =(34 32 4), peak   Z  -score=3.3   P  -values=not significant). There was also a trend for a correlation between depressive symptom increase and increased activity of the right amygdala to H faces (  xyz  =(28 4 \u201316), peak   Z  -score=3.3,   P  =0.06). See   for details. \n\nIn the placebo group and for all of the three contrasts, there was no significant correlation between extracted activity within the amygdala and insula pre- and post-intervention (Pearson correlation coefficients <0.3). In order to exclude that baseline measures drove our results, an additional analysis based on neural activity in the post-GnRHa session only was conducted. This confirmed that the increase in depressive symptoms correlated with F- and H-elicited activity in bilateral insula (F\u2212N:   xyz  =(\u201334 16 \u20132), peak   Z  -score=4.1,   P  <0.001 and   xyz  =(32 36 0), peak   Z-  score=4.1,   P  <0.05,  , H\u2212N:   xyz  =(\u201326 22 \u20132), peak   Z  -score=4.4,   P  <0.001 and   xyz  =(32 22 \u20132), peak   Z  -score=4.0,   P  <0.001,  ), and further correlated with F- and H-elicited activity in the amygdala (F\u2212N:   xyz  =(\u201324 2 \u201318), peak   Z  -score=3.5,   P  <0.05,  , H\u2212N:   xyz  =(\u201326 0 \u201316), peak   Z  -score=3.7,   P  <0.05,   and   xyz  =(28 2 \u201314), peak   Z  -score=3.5,   P  <0.05). There was a similar trend (  P  <0.001 for A faces within the right and left insula (  xyz  =(32 24 0), peak   Z  -score=3.6 and   xyz  =(\u201326 26 \u20134), peak   Z  -score=3.3) but not in the amygdala (  P  >0.05). See   for details. The correlations between insula and amygdala activity and changes in depressive scores remained significant also after adjusting for changes in estradiol levels. \n\nWhen considering the relationship between brain activity at the post-GnRHa session and absolute Hamilton scores (as opposed to changes from baseline) for depressive symptoms at the post-GnRHa session, similar patterns emerged, with significant correlations in bilateral insula and left amygdala ( ). In addition, happiness-elicited activity in the supragenual anterior cingulate cortex correlated with depressive symptoms ( ). Changes in depressive symptoms correlated with depressive symptom scores at the post-GnRHa session (Pearson correlation=0.84,   P  <0.001). \n\n\n#### Correlations with estradiol decline \n  \nWithin the GnRHa group, the net decline in estradiol levels across the intervention period tended to correlate (  P  <0.001) with an altered response of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to F faces (  xyz  =(\u201342 18 16), peak   Z  -score=3.7,   P  =0.12) from baseline. When considering the post-GnRHa session only, no significant correlations with the magnitude of the estradiol decline (  P  >0.001) were revealed. This was the case also in a complete case analysis where the four cases with estradiol values below detection limit were omitted, as well as when estradiol measures were treated on the absolute scale. \n\n\n#### Imaging results at baseline \n  \nPre-intervention, for the full sample, A, but not F, faces elicited significantly stronger left amygdala activity than N faces (  xyz  =(\u201328 2 \u201322), peak   Z  -score=3.6,   P  <0.05). Pre-intervention, H faces elicited significant right anterior insula activity (  xyz  =(44 18 \u20134), peak   Z  -score=3.5,   P  <0.05), with a trend (  P  <0.001) in the left insula as well as for F and A faces. None of the ROIs displayed a significant correlation between activity to any of the emotional faces and baseline estradiol levels (across groups). However, there was a trend (  P  <0.001) for a positive correlation between baseline estradiol levels and activity to F and A faces in bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (F\u2212N:   xyz  =(\u201346 48 2), peak   Z  -score=3.7,   P  =0.07; A\u2212N:   xyz  =(\u201352 36 22), peak   Z  -score=3.6,   P  =0.09 and   xyz  =(56 40 12), peak   Z  -score=3.8,   P  =0.06), with a similar trend for H faces. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe ovarian sex-steroid hormone manipulation affected processing of emotional faces in a manner dependent on depressive responses to the intervention. Women with a larger GnRHa-induced depressive response had a larger increase in emotion-elicited insula activity irrespective of emotional valence. When only considering the post-GnRHa fMRI session, apart from confirming the insula finding, also amygdala recruitment was associated with a larger depressive response. These findings were not driven by baseline conditions, and the magnitude of the GnRHa-induced net estradiol decline did not account for the effects. \n\nOur findings of changes in emotional processing may either be directly pharmacologically driven or secondary to the (sub)clinical depressive symptoms that may emerge in particularly sensitive individuals. The absence of an association between GnRHa-induced estradiol decline and emotion-probed brain activity that map onto changes in depressive symptoms supports the latter. However, it does not necessarily exclude that hormone fluctuations mediate the current findings. Since GnRHa induces a biphasic ovarian hormone response, where the estradiol decline is preceded by an augmentation, variability in the magnitude of the initial augmentation may be of importance, as may inter-individual variability in sensitivity either to the augmentation or to the subsequent estradiol drop.  If such increased estradiol sensitivity would translate to an increased bottom-up engagement of the insula and amygdala to emotional stimuli, our findings would be compatible with the notion that the depressive response is a consequence of the change in emotion processing. Notably, previous studies in women show differences in sensitivity to fluctuations in estradiol to be critical for the development of a depressed state; subjects with a history of depression have increased risk of depression as a function of the estradiol fluctuations during menopausal transition,  and, estradiol sensitivity in late pregnancy, where sex-steroid levels are massively increased, predicts postpartum depression.  Thus, inter-individual differences in the sensitivity to the same estradiol changes may be of importance for the interpretation of the current findings. Future studies should elucidate the importance of an estradiol flare and study relevant high-risk populations to further explore the importance of estradiol sensitivity, for example, by including biomarkers of sensitivity to sex steroids. \n\nOur data suggest that, with increased depressive symptoms, insula engagement when processing negative stimuli changed in the same direction as that of positive stimuli. The fact that the engagement of insula was independent of emotional valence is well in line with previous studies suggesting that insula reacts to both positive and negative stimuli.  A core function of insula, in particular the anterior portion, seems to be to facilitate bottom-up detection of salient events that informs additional processing and the generation of appropriate behavioural responses.  The positive correlation between insula activity change to emotional stimuli and increase in depressive symptoms we observed is consistent with some  but not all  studies. Previous studies suggesting that insula function is sensitive to sex-steroid hormone changes offer no consensus on directions. In healthy individuals, left insula activity has been noted to be decreased in response to negative emotional stimuli in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.  In contrast, a study in PMDD patients points towards enhanced insula activation during response inhibition in the symptomatic phase (luteal phase),  which is well in line with our observations. \n\nWe speculate that an increased insula engagement in processing of salient stimuli might represent a mechanism by which sex-steroid hormone fluctuations can trigger disturbed affective processing and hence influence mood in vulnerable individuals. It is possible that hyperreactivity to emotional salience is a correlate to the postpartum blues state that occurs in most women 3\u20135 days postpartum, which is characterized by dysphoric mood, crying, mood lability, anxiety, irritability and a feeling of easily being overwhelmed with emotions. \n\nWhen only the post-GnRHa session was considered, the observation of higher activity in subjects with a larger increase in depressive symptoms extended beyond the insula, and also included our primary ROI, the amygdala. Thus, apparently, women who mood-wise were more vulnerable to GnRHa sex-hormone manipulation displayed increased amygdala and insula involvement in processing salient stimuli, independent of stimulus valence. Several studies support that amygdala react to both negative and positive stimuli.  Hyperactivity of the amygdala has also been reported in the luteal, as compared with the follicular, phase of the menstrual cycle in healthy women when estradiol levels are decreasing.  In contrast to our GnRHa-related findings, blunting of the amygdala response to aversive stimuli has been reported to correlate with depression severity in manifest postpartum depression.  Since our model best matches the onset of a depression and our participants only displayed subtle and primarily subclinical depressive symptoms, our findings are not directly comparable to the latter findings reported by Moses-Kolko   et al.   However, our findings are in line with the meta-analysis of Groenwold   et al.   that showed a correlation between depressive response and amygdala activity elicited by fearful stimuli, and suggest that such an effect is independent of emotional valence. With regard to the increased amygdala activity to happy faces in subjects with more GnRHa-induced depressive symptoms, no clear consensus on potential differences between controls and patients with major depression disorder exists. \n\nAlthough progesterone has also been linked to mood sensitivtity and emotion-related brain activity, in particular in PMDD,  the absence of a net change in progesterone levels in the current model  prevented us from directly addressing potential contributions from progesterone changes. Yet, within the GnRHa framework we cannot firmly separate effects from different ovarian-steroid hormones, for example, from the early stimulatory phase of the GnRHa intervention. Future studies should address the potential specificity of individual ovarian-steroid hormones in the context. \n\nOur study design does not allow a firm conclusion on whether more complex neurobiological consequences of GnRHa intervention may mediate the effects on insula and amygdala engagement in processing of emotional salient stimuli. Potential mechanistic factors can involve compromised serotonin signalling  or degradation of monoamines in general.  We have previously reported on an interaction between the magnitude of the estradiol decline and increased serotonin transporter availability on the depressive response to GnRHa based on molecular brain imaging data within the present cohort.  It is possible that inter-individual variation in the influence of GnRHa on serotonergic transmission, including effects of the initial stimulatory phase, could explain the proposed variation in estradiol sensitivity. Such a mechanism may well include serotonergic influence on amygdala function,  and will be further pursued in future studies. Further, one might speculate that GnRHa could have a direct effect on insula and/or amygdala activity. However, this is considered unlikely since GnRH receptors are primarily expressed within the Hypothalamus\u2212Pituitary\u2212Gonadal axis and particularly not in insula.  Finally, it should be kept in mind that this study has not yet been replicated. \n\nIn conclusion, our data demonstrate that enhanced recruitment of the anterior insula and amygdala during emotional processing have a role in the mechanism by which sex-hormone fluctuations trigger depressive symptoms, which may correspond to the hypersensitivity to emotional stimuli frequently experienced by women in perimenopause or the immediate postpartum period. These findings may provide a rationale for future testing of preventive strategies in high-risk individuals, for example, by thorough monitoring of mental well-being during perimenopause and in the immediate and early postpartum phase, and, to the extent that extreme high-risk individuals can be identified, possibly shorter term estradiol treatment in phases where women decline rapidly or fluctuate in ovarian sex-steroid levels. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: tbl1\n### Label: Table 1\nContrast\tRegion\tLaterality\tP???-value\tZ-score\tx\ty\tz\nCorrelation between increase in activity and increase in depressive symptoms\tCorrelation between increase in activity and increase in depressive symptoms\tCorrelation between increase in activity and increase in depressive symptoms\tCorrelation between increase in activity and increase in depressive symptoms\tCorrelation between increase in activity and increase in depressive symptoms\tCorrelation between increase in activity and increase in depressive symptoms\tCorrelation between increase in activity and increase in depressive symptoms\tCorrelation between increase in activity and increase in depressive symptoms\nF\u2212N\tInsula\tL\tP<0.05\t3.6\t\u221232\t16\t0\nA\u2212N\tInsula\tL\tPunc<0.001\t3.1\t\u221226\t26\t\u22122\n\t\tR\tPunc<0.001\t3.3\t34\t32\t4\nH\u2212N\tInsula\tL\tPunc<0.001\t3.7\t\u221226\t22\t\u22122\n\t\tR\tP<0.001\t4.0\t34\t32\t6\nH\u2212N\tAmygdala\tR\tPunc<0.001\t3.3\t28\t4\t\u221216\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and increase in depressive symptoms\tCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and increase in depressive symptoms\tCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and increase in depressive symptoms\tCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and increase in depressive symptoms\tCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and increase in depressive symptoms\tCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and increase in depressive symptoms\tCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and increase in depressive symptoms\tCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and increase in depressive symptoms\nF\u2212N\tInsula\tL\tP<0.001\t4.1\t\u221234\t16\t\u22122\n\t\tR\tP<0.05\t4.1\t32\t36\t0\nA\u2212N\tInsula\tL\tPunc<0.001\t3.3\t\u221226\t26\t\u22124\n\t\tR\tPunc<0.001\t3.6\t32\t24\t0\nH\u2212N\tInsula\tL\tP<0.001\t4.4\t\u221226\t22\t\u22122\n\t\tR\tP<0.001\t4.0\t32\t22\t\u22122\nF\u2212N\tAmygdala\tL\tP<0.05\t3.5\t\u221224\t2\t\u221218\nH\u2212N\tAmygdala\tL\tP<0.05\t3.7\t\u221226\t0\t\u221216\n\t\tR\tP<0.05\t3.5\t28\t2\t\u221214\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and depressive symptoms post-GnRHa\tCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and depressive symptoms post-GnRHa\tCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and depressive symptoms post-GnRHa\tCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and depressive symptoms post-GnRHa\tCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and depressive symptoms post-GnRHa\tCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and depressive symptoms post-GnRHa\tCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and depressive symptoms post-GnRHa\tCorrelation between activity post-GnRHa and depressive symptoms post-GnRHa\nF\u2212N\tInsula\tL\tP<0.001\t4.8\t\u221234\t18\t\u22126\n\t\tR\tP<0.001\t4.1\t48\t12\t\u22124\nA\u2212N\tInsula\tL\tP<0.05\t4.1\t\u221226\t24\t2\n\t\tR\tPunc<0.001\t3.3\t32\t22\t\u22122\nH\u2212N\tInsula\tL\tP<0.001\t4.8\t\u221238\t\u22124\t\u221210\n\t\tR\tP<0.001\t4.7\t48\t6\t\u22126\nF\u2212N\tAmygdala\tL\tP<0.001\t3.8\t\u221224\t2\t\u221218\nH\u2212N\tAmygdala\tL\tP<0.05\t3.7\t\u221216\t\u22124\t\u221218\nH\u2212N\tACC supragenual\t\tP<0.05\t3.7\t2\t24\t24\n### Caption\nRelationship: brain activity and GnRHa-induced depressive symptoms\n### Footer\nAbreviations: A, angry; ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; F, fearful; GnRHa, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist; H, happy; N, neutral; unc, uncorrected.aP-values are family wise error-corrected at cluster-level using small volume correction if not otherwise stated.\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5068584, "text_md5": "9dc679d2307dd3aa96fb255c5dc65e2c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 110], "journal": [111, 128], "publication_year": [130, 134], "title": [145, 255], "keywords": [269, 269], "abstract": [282, 2021], "body": [2030, 30783], "tables": [30796, 33849]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 26624927, "doi": "10.1038/tp.2015.184", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5068584", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5068584"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5068584\">5068584</a>", "list_title": "PMC5068584  Role of emotional processing in depressive responses to sex-hormone manipulation: a pharmacological fMRI study"}

Geranmayeh   et al.   perform longitudinal fMRI in 27 patients after stroke, and show that preSMA/dACC activity during speech production positively correlates with levels of spontaneous recovery. Recruitment of domain-general systems can thus help to restore language function. \n  \nWe hypothesized that the recovery of speech production after left hemisphere stroke not only depends on the integrity of language-specialized brain systems, but also on \u2018domain-general\u2019 brain systems that have much broader functional roles. The presupplementary motor area/dorsal anterior cingulate forms part of the cingular-opercular network, which has a broad role in cognition and learning. Consequently, we have previously suggested that variability in the recovery of speech production after aphasic stroke may relate in part to differences in patients\u2019 abilities to engage this domain-general brain region. To test our hypothesis, 27 patients (aged 59 \u00b1 11 years) with a left hemisphere stroke performed behavioural assessments and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging tasks at two time points; first in the early phase (\u223c2 weeks) and then \u223c4 months after the ictus. The functional magnetic resonance imaging tasks were designed to differentiate between activation related to language production (sentential overt speech production\u2014Speech task) and activation related to cognitive processing (non-verbal decision making). Simple rest and counting conditions were also included in the design. Task-evoked regional brain activations during the early and late phases were compared with a longitudinal measure of recovery of language production. In accordance with a role in cognitive processing, substantial activity was observed within the presupplementary motor area/dorsal anterior cingulate during the decision-making task. Critically, the level of activation within this region during speech production correlated positively with the longitudinal recovery of speech production across the two time points (as measured by the in-scanner performance in the Speech task). This relationship was observed for activation in both the early phase (  r   = 0.363,   P   = 0.03 one-tailed) and the late phase (  r   = 0.538,   P   = 0.004). Furthermore, presupplementary motor area/dorsal anterior cingulate activity was a predictor of both language recovery over time and language outcome at \u223c4 months, over and above that predicted by lesion volume, age and the initial language impairment (general linear model overall significant at   P <   0.0001; ExpB 1.01,   P   = 0.02). The particularly prominent relationship of the presupplementary motor area/dorsal anterior cingulate region with recovery of language was confirmed in voxel-wise correlation analysis, conducted unconstrained for the whole brain volume. These results accord with the hypothesis that the functionality of the presupplementary motor area/dorsal anterior cingulate contributes to language recovery after stroke. Given that this brain region is often spared in aphasic stroke, we propose that it is a sensible target for future research into rehabilitative treatments. More broadly, baseline assessment of domain-general systems could help provide a better prediction of language recovery. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nLanguage processing is arguably our most sophisticated ability and its impairment after aphasic stroke is both common and debilitating. Consequently, the mechanisms of language recovery after aphasic stroke have been the focus of much debate in the literature ( ;  ;  ). \n\nA large proportion of previous studies on this topic have focused on relating recovery to the structure and function of perilesional regions that are classically considered to have language-specialized functions ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The remainder have focused on understanding the involvement of contralateral homotopic regions in the right hemisphere ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), which is believed to facilitate recovery, or the contralesional transcallosal disinhibition of the lesioned hemisphere, which is believed to hinder recovery ( ;  ;  ,  ;  ). \n\nMore recently, it has been proposed that \u2018domain-general\u2019 brain networks also play a key role in recovery from aphasic stroke. This hypothesis is based on the assertion that language performance is not only dependent on brain regions that display language-specialized functions such as phonological, semantic, and syntactic processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), but also on widely distributed and often overlapping brain regions that make broader, or \u2018domain-general\u2019, contributions to cognition ( ;  ;  , ). Indeed, the area of cortex within the classical Broca\u2019s area contains subregions that have both of these properties ( ,  ). \n\nThese domain-general regions support a variety of processes including working memory, reasoning, attention, and executive function ( ;  ). One specific domain-general network that has been suggested to support recovery of language function after stroke is the cingular-opercular network. This network includes the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the adjacent presupplementary motor area (preSMA/dACC) and the bilateral anterior insular with adjacent inferior frontal gyrus These brain regions lie within the so-called Multiple Demand Cortex ( B, in yellow), a widely distributed volume of cortex that is commonly co-recruited and supports a variety of cognitive processes ( ;  ;  ). \n\nActivation of the brain regions within the cingular-opercular network has been associated with a particularly wide variety of tasks that require the wilful control of behaviour, including inhibitory control ( ), target detection ( ), detection of salient events ( ;  ;  ;  ), attentional switching ( ), and the attentional control required for stable task set maintenance ( ,  ;  ;  ). Most relevant to recovery of behaviour after stroke, is the increased activity of the cingular-opercular network when new behaviours are being learnt. These include the learning of new visuomotor associations ( ;  ), stimulus response rules ( ) and, critically learning a pseudo-language (Sliwinska   et al.  , submitted for publication). Based on the broad role of the cingular-opercular network in learning and cognition, we have previously proposed that the integrity of its function, in particular in the preSMA/dACC, may underlie a better language outcome after aphasic stroke ( ;  ). \n\nHere we tested a direct prediction of this hypothesis in a functional MRI study that was designed to investigate the relationship between cingular-opercular network activity, and the longitudinal recovery of speech production after stroke. Specifically, a cohort of patients undertook event-related functional MRI tasks first at \u223c2 weeks (early scan) and then at \u223c4 months (late scan) after a left hemisphere stroke. This is a time at which the most rapid recovery typically occurs. The functional MRI tasks were carefully chosen to differentiate between regions of brain activity that related to language processes (namely sentential overt speech production) or to cognitive processes more generally (e.g. non-verbal decision making). In accordance with our hypotheses, we focused our analyses on the preSMA/dACC region; however, we also confirmed the prominent role of this region by applying voxel-wise analyses to the whole brain volume. Our prediction was that the magnitude of activation within this domain-general brain region would correlate positively with the longitudinal recovery of speech production after a left hemisphere stroke. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe National Research Ethics Service Committee approved this study. Patients with left hemisphere infarcts and premorbid fluency in English were recruited. Patients with a previous history of a stroke resulting in aphasia or other neurological illness, or concurrent use of psychoactive drugs, were excluded. Twenty-seven participants were scanned at two time points; first in the early phase after the stroke [15 \u00b1 7.6 days, mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD)] and again at \u223c4 months (108 \u00b1 26 days) after an average interscan interval of 93 \u00b1 26 days. The patients were aged 59.1 \u00b1 10.8 years with a male:female ratio of 1:0.6. One patient was left-handed, but was clearly aphasic at stroke onset. All patients had infarcts in the left hemisphere. The average lesion volume was 41.4 \u00b1 44.4 cm  ( ). Three patients had additional small infarcts (0.5, 1.5 and 3.5 cm ) in the right hemisphere. In two cases this right-sided lesion predated that of the infarct in the left hemisphere without causing any lasting clinical deficits. Demographic information, details of the stroke, and assessments are provided in  . \n  \n Overlay of the lesion distribution in the patients with left hemisphere stroke, projected on standard brain templates.   Lesions were defined separately at each time point. The colour code represents the number of patients with a lesion in a given voxel. The numbers above the brain slices represent the MNI coordinates in the   z   plane, in millimetres. T : \u223c2 weeks after stroke; T : \u223c4 months after stroke. Lesion volumes were highly correlated across both sessions (  r   = 0.969,   P   < 0.001) but they were lower in the second session reflecting post-stroke atrophy of the surrounding tissues. The values derived from the first session were used in the analyses and are listed in  . \n  \nTwenty-four age-matched, right-handed, fluent English-speaking healthy participants were also recruited (aged 57 \u00b1 11 years; female ratio = 1:4). Data from controls and cross-sectional analyses of patient data have been previously published ( ,  ,  ). Only the behavioural results from controls will be discussed in this article ( ).\n   \nIn-scanner performance and behavioural assessments \n    \n\n\n### Behavioural assessments \n  \nThe key measure of speech production ability was the in-scanner language measure henceforth called \u2018language measure\u2019 ( ). During the scan, speech production was recorded using a magnetic resonance compatible microphone (Optoacoustics FOMRI-III). These were transcribed and analysed to calculate the number of appropriate information carrying words (AICW), as defined by  , and the syllable rate of speech production. Purely articulatory and dysarthria errors were not penalized when calculating AICW, but semantic and phonological errors were accounted for. For the Decision trials, the percentage of trials with correct target identification and the median reaction time for the responses were recorded ( ). \n\nAs post-stroke aphasia is a multidimentional disorder, the patients also performed a number of other assessments ( ) to capture the range of the deficit across several language and non-language neuropsychological domains: (i) Comprehensive Aphasia Test (CAT,  ) screening for language comprehension and production deficits. This included the cognitive subset of the CAT that taps into episodic memory, semantic memory, visual judgement, fluency, praxis and arithmetic; (ii) a brief version of the Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrix Test ( ); (iii) a modified version of the quantitative analysis of speech production based on patient\u2019s narrative description of the Cinderella story (spontaneous speech) ( ;  ). The test of spontaneous speech allowed for a detailed assessment of narrative speech production ability taking into account information-carrying capacity of utterances, syntax and grammar without penalizing dysarthric errors ( ). The controls performed the cognitive section of the CAT, spontaneous speech production and the Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrix Test on one occasion only. \n\nA principal component analysis of the above measures at the early time (Time 1) was performed to determine the latent variable structure underlying correlations between all these scores ( ). Based on this principal component analysis, the main behavioural measure of interest was identified as the in-scanner language measure. The language outcome was defined as the raw score at \u223c4 months post-ictus, and the language recovery was defined as improvement in the scores over time (Time 2 \u2212 Time 1). \n\n\n### Functional MRI procedure \n  \nFunctional MRI data were obtained on Siemens Magnetom Trio 3 T scanner using gradient-echo sequences (36 slices acquired in an interleaved order; resolution: 3.5 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 3.0 mm; field of view: 225 \u00d7 225 \u00d7 108 mm; repetition time, 10 s; acquisition time, 2 s; echo time 31 ms; flip angle, 90\u00b0). A 1 mm  T -weighted image and field maps (used to reduce field inhomogeneity) were also acquired. \n\n\n### Functional MRI paradigm \n  \nA \u2018sparse\u2019 functional MRI design ( ) was used to minimize artefacts associated with overt speech ( ). Tasks were performed in response to specific visual stimuli during 7-s epochs, and terminated by the display of a fixation cross. Functional imaging data were acquired 1 s later, over 2 s. Each of the two functional MRI sessions after the stroke (early after stroke = Time 1, and 4 months after stroke = Time 2) included three runs. Each run consisted of four conditions; (i) 20 speech trials; (ii) 16 count trials; (iii) 16 decision trials; and (iv) 15 rest trials. Each condition was presented in blocks of two or four trials. Each of the four decision blocks were preceded by an instruction page that was displayed for 10 s. \n\nDuring the Speech task, all participants were required to define nouns. These were presented in the form of coloured picture stimuli ( ;  ). In total 120 pictures were chosen and matched across each of the runs with respect to imageability, concreteness, familiarity, and frequency based on measures derived from the Medical Research Council psycholinguistic database ( ). A different picture was displayed for 7 s at each trial. The participants were instructed to generate as much verbal information pertaining to the given object as possible. An example of a patient\u2019s response to the picture of a spoon was \u2018Spoon, (pause) it\u2019s (pause) eat soup\u2019. For the Count trials, participants counted up from 1 at a rate of 1/s upon seeing the prompt \u20181\u2026\u2019. During the Rest trials, they saw a fixation cross throughout the trial. For the Decision trials, they were required to press a button on seeing a target (a blue square) and make no response for a distractor (an orange circle), both of which were presented in equal frequencies in a random order. The participants received training before the scan. \n\n\n### Image analysis \n  \nData were preprocessed with the FMRIB Software Library ( ). Preprocessing steps included: motion-correction; non-brain voxels removal; spatial smoothing (8 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel); and high-pass temporal filtering. The six motion parameters derived from the motion-correction step, were included as regressors for each functional MRI run. Registration of functional MRI images to high resolution structural images was carried out by Boundary-Based Registration ( ) and fieldmap-based EPI distortion correction. The high resolution structural images were registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute standard space (MNI 152) using FMRIB\u2019s Linear Image Registration Tool. A manually delineated binary inverted lesion mask was included to downweight the influence of the lesion in the registration and thus minimize distortions associated with the registration of brain with infarcts. \n\nLesion volume was calculated in standard space. As well as calculating gross lesion volume, the percentage damage to domain-general cingular-opercular network ( , top) and a language-specific left-lateralized frontal-temporal-parietal network were also calculated for each patient ( , bottom). These masks were obtained from previous analyses of the functional MRI data from the control participants performing the same paradigm ( ). The cingular-opercular network included correlated activity within bilateral frontal operculum/anterior insular cortex and preSMA/dACC. Activity in this network (from a multivariate ICA) has been previously found to be increased during the non-verbal decision task compared to a relatively effortless speech production task in control participants (see Component 7,   in  ). The left-lateralized frontal-temporal-parietal network showed activity that was greater for speech production at sentence-level in contrast to rest and in contrast to the counting or non-verbal Decision tasks (see Component 4, Figure 3 in  ). \n  \n Standard T -weighted anatomical slices overlaid with a mask of domain-general brain activity within cingular-opercular network (  top  ) and a left-lateralized frontal-parietal-temporal language-specific network (  bottom  ).   The masks were obtained from previous analyses of control participants performing the same functional MRI task ( ), and were used to calculate the lesion load in each network. R = right; L = left; A = anterior; P = posterior. \n  \nIndividual functional MRI data were analysed in general linear models (GLMs) in SPM12, modelling the combination of the three runs for the three conditions over the two time points with the addition of nuisance variables to account for head movement and noise using a fixed effects model. Translations and rotations were captured in the   x  ,   y   and   z   plane. Contrast images of interest depicting parameter estimates for the experimental predictor functions were collected from the first-level model and used in the group-level analyses. \n\nAt the individual subject level, parameter estimates for each of the three task conditions (Speech, Count, and Decision) were generated relative to the Rest baseline. These were collated and examined voxel-wise at the group level using a full factorial design in SPM12, in which the within subject factors were session (Time 1 versus Time 2) and task conditions (Speech, Count, and Decision). Data were collapsed across runs for each session and language measures and recovery were included as the covariate in the design. \n\nThe group-level effects were examined using a random effects analysis that used familywise error (FWE) cluster correction for the whole brain volume at   P   < 0.05. This analysis was restricted to a volume of the brain in which no patient had lesions. This meant a large proportion (290 cm ) of the left hemisphere, mainly in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, was excluded from the analysis. This minimizes the confounding effects of heterogeneous lesion morphology in the patients. \n\nTo identify voxels that were involved in general cognition as opposed to language   per se  , the decision task was contrasted against the other two (Count and Speech), collapsed across both sessions. The midline voxel with highest activity during the Decision task was chosen as a functional region of interest. A measure of the mean activity of this region of interest during the Speech task was entered into a repeated measures ANOVA with Session as the within-subject factor and Language recovery (Time 2 \u2013 Time 1) as the between-subject covariate. The relationship between the activity in this region and recovery was further examined with correlation analyses and generalized linear models in SPSS. \n\nFinally a confirmatory whole brain unconstrained voxel-wise analysis (excluding the lesioned volume) was performed to determine the areas of activity that correlated with the magnitude of the recovery of the language measure. Data from both time points were included in the model. Again, this was FWE cluster corrected for the whole brain volume excluding voxels of the lesion mask. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioural results \n  \nAll reported   P  -values are two-tailed unless stated otherwise. The scores for the behavioural assessments are presented in  . At the time of early assessment, patients had significantly reduced performance compared to the healthy participants on measures of spontaneous speech production, verbal fluency, and in-scanner language measure based on the Speech task performance. They also had poorer performance on the cognitive measure, Ravens Matrix and reaction time, although overall accuracy during the Decision task was not different to control subjects ( ). A repeated measures ANOVA on data from the patients showed a significant effect of session, suggesting that the patients had on average substantially recovered to some degree over the two time points [  F  (1,25) = 30.6,   P   < 0.001]. This improvement was seen across all assessments except accuracy on the Decision task (  post hoc   paired   t  -test,  ). \n\n\n### Early predictors of language outcome and language recovery 4 months after stroke \n  \nSeveral demographic and stroke characteristics as well as scores set out in  , were examined to identify potential confounding factors. Cognitive score (  r   = 0.603,   P   = 0.001), language measure (  r   = 0.826,   P   < 0.0001), and accuracy on the Decision task (  r   = 0.399,   P   = 0.039) during the early phase, positively correlated with language performance at 4 months. Reaction time for the decision trials had a negative relationship (  r   = \u22120.337,   P   = 0.04 one-tailed), with faster participants in the early scan, having a better language outcome at 4 months. \n\nTotal lesion volume (  r   = \u22120.555,   P   = 0.003) and more specifically percentage damage to a large left-lateralized frontal-temporal-parietal language network (  r   = \u22120.462,   P   = 0.015) and the domain-general cingular-opercular network (  r   = \u22120.438,   P   = 0.022) all negatively correlated with language outcome at 4 months (see   for representations of these two networks). Total years of education (  r   = 0.485,   P   = 0.01) had a positive correlation with language outcome at 4 months, while age (  P   = 0.54) and hours of speech therapy (  P   = 0.23) had no correlation. \n\nWhen performing a multiple regression model with Language measure at Time 2 as the dependent variable and all the above behavioural measures, lesion characteristics and demographic factors as the independent variable, the model accounted for 72% of the variance in the language outcome at 4 months [  R   = 0.72,   F  (10,16) = 7.67,   P   < 0.001]. Only early language measure performance (beta = 0.767,   P   = 0.002) and age (beta = \u22120.257,   P   = 0.047) were the overall significant predictors of language outcome at 4 months after stroke. \n\nA similar regression model, this time with language recovery (Time 2 \u2212 Time 1) as the dependent variable, accounted for 63% of the variance in language recovery [  R   = 0.63,   F  (10,16) = 4.95,   P   = 0.02]. Again, only early language performance (beta = \u22120.813,   P   = 0.002) and age (beta = \u22120.306,   P   = 0.047) were the overall significant predictors of language recovery over time. \n\n\n### Domain-general non-verbal activity in the midline frontal cortex \n  \nTo identify voxels that were involved in domain-general cognition, the decision task was contrasted against the other two (Count and Speech), collapsed across both sessions, with cluster correction for multiple comparisons (voxel-wise thresholded at   P   < 0.05, then FWE whole brain cluster-wise corrected at   P   < 0.05). As expected, a large cluster was evident along the midline extending back from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex into mid-cingulate cortex, preSMA and the SMA with peak voxel within the preSMA ( A). Activation was also evident within the precentral gyrus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex within the inferior frontal gyrus and the right parietal cortex and temporal parietal junctions. No activity was evident in the left homotopic regions as the lesioned volume was masked out in the analysis, to include only the non-lesioned brain across all participants. Parameter estimates were extracted from the peak voxel in the midline cluster, located within the preSMA (  x  ,   y  ,   z   coordinates: \u22124, 8, 50) for further analysis in relation to the behavioural measures ( B, blue). Overlap of this coordinate over the set of brain regions known as multiple demand cortex ( ;  ) confirmed that this region is involved in domain-general cognitive processing ( B, yellow). \n  \n Domain-general brain activity. (A)   Standard T -weighted anatomical slices overlaid with domain-general brain activity showing areas of activity greater for the non-verbal decision task compared to the two verbal tasks (Count and Speech). Voxel-wise corrected at   P   < 0.05, then FWE cluster-wise corrected at   P   < 0.05. The numbered regions are as follows: (1) dACC and adjacent mid-cingulate cortex and preSMA; (2) superior parietal lobule extending to supramarginal gyrus and angular gyrus; (3) right anterior insular cortex; (4) precentral gyrus extending into middle frontal gyrus; (5) right inferior frontal gyrus; and (6) right posterior middle temporal gyrus. There was also bilateral thalamic activation. See   for coordinate details. (  B  ) The cross hair corresponds to the midline peak activation voxel (  x  ,   y  ,   z   = \u22124, 8, 50) forming the basis of subsequent analyses in  . The peak area of activity is marked over the activation pattern from the current analysis in blue, and over the domain-general brain regions more commonly known as the multiple demand cortex in yellow ( ;  ). \n  \n  \nCoordinates for each local maxima within significant clusters of activation as shown in   and  \n  \n\n\n### Presupplementary motor area/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activity and language recovery over time \n  \nThe peak voxel (  x  ,   y  ,   z   coordinates: \u22124 , 8, 50) from the analysis above ( B) was chosen as the target functional region of interest for a region that demonstrated a sensitivity to general non-verbal cognitive demands. A one-sample   t  -test against 0 showed on average no significant activation in this region during the Speech task (  t   = \u22121.517,   P   = 0.141). The peak region is within the preSMA but the activation cluster extends into the dACC. \n\nTo determine the role of this preSMA/dACC region of interest in language recovery, its activity during the Speech task alone was extracted and entered into a repeated measures ANOVA with Session as the within-subject effect and Language recovery (change in score between Time 1 and Time 2) as the between-subject factor. There was no main effect of session [  F  (1,25) = 1.527,   P   = 0.228] and no interaction of Session \u00d7 Recovery [  F  (1,25) = 1.075,   P   = 0.310]. Critically though, there was a significant main effect of Recovery [  F  (1,25) = 10.603,   P   = 0.003]. \n\nA generalized linear model with robust estimation was performed in SPSS with recovery as the dependent variable. The main predictor of interest was the activity in the preSMA/dACC averaged across both the early and the late sessions. In a second model, lesion volume was added as an additional predictor. Finally, a third model included preSMA/dACC activity, lesion volume, age, and the early language score as predictors. The latter two factors were included in the third model as they were identified as significant predictive factors in the above reported behavioural analyses. All three models were significant (  P   < 0.002;  , top three models). The preSMA/dACC activity level was a significant predictor of recovery (  P   = 0.005). Specifically, for every extra point increased in activity in the preSMA/dACC, recovery was 1.02 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01\u20131.04] times greater ( , Model 1). This relationship remained significant (  P   = 0.002) when adding in lesion volume ( , Model 2). Indeed, lesion volume was not a significant predictor (  P   = 0.45). Finally, the relationship remained significant (  P   = 0.02) when adding in early language score and age, both of which had a significant negative relationship with recovery ( , Model 3). Similar results were obtained when using language outcome at \u223c4 months as the dependent variable ( , bottom).\n   \nGeneralized linear model analyses \n    \n\nFurther testing confirmed that the activity in the peak voxel of midline frontal cortex in the preSMA/dACC, during the early scan (  r   = 0.363,   P   = 0.03 one-tailed) and late scan (  r   = 0.538,   P   = 0.004) when performing the Speech task were both correlated positively with degree of language recovery ( ). The positive correlation with language recovery was only observed for activity within the preSMA/dACC region during the Speech task, and not for the activity when participants performed other tasks (e.g. the non-linguistic Decision task). \n  \n Relationship between midline-frontal (preSMA/dACC) activity and language recovery over time.   Different correlation plots are shown based on the activity in this region during the early scan (dotted line) and the late scan at 4 months after stroke (solid line). There was a significant positive relationship between activity at each time point and level of language recovery. \n  \n\n### Whole-brain correlation with language recovery \n  \nThe relationship between language recovery and midline frontal cortex brain activation was examined further using an unconstrained whole brain voxel-wise analysis (cluster rendered at   P   < 0.05 with 200 voxel extent). A single cluster was evident that encompassed the dACC and extended back through the preSMA and SMA ( ). The peak voxel within this cluster was significant at   P   < 0.001 FWE corrected for the whole brain volume. \n  \n Standard T -weighted anatomical slices overlaid with activity correlating with language recovery.   A large cluster of activity was observed in the preSMA extending to dorsal mid-cingulate cortex and dACC (1). Activity was also observed in the right pre- and post-central gyri (2) and right posterior superior temporal gyrus. (Rendered at   P   < 0.05 with 200 voxel extent. Peak voxel whole brain significant at   P   < 0.001 FWE corrected). See   for coordinate details. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis longitudinal functional MRI study examined how activity within a domain-general brain region relates to the magnitude of recovery of language after a left hemisphere stroke. The preSMA/dACC was proposed in advance as a region with domain-general cognitive function and it was localized in the current study by its robust activation during a decision-making task relative to language tasks. The level of activity in this region when patients attempted to speak was positively correlated with the level of spontaneous recovery of speech production after stroke. \n\nTo account for the contribution of behavioural factors to the language outcomes and recovery, we first identified these factors amongst several potential measures in separate multiple regression analyses. The early language performance\u2014a marker of initial aphasic stroke severity\u2014and age were identified as the overall significant predictors of both the language performance at 4 months and the recovery over time in keeping with previous studies ( ;  ;  ). Therefore, we accounted for these two factors, along with lesion volume, in the subsequent analyses. The activity in the preSMA/dACC was a significant predictor of recovery of language in a model that included lesion volume, age and initial aphasic severity (as measured by in-scanner language performance) as additional confounds. These results accord closely with the hypothesis that the preSMA/dACC is involved in the recovery process. \n\nThe contribution of domain-general brain regions in recovery from aphasic stroke has previously been proposed in the neuropsychological literature ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). More recently functional neuroimaging has provided neurobiological evidence to support the notion that language processes involve an interaction between language specialized and domain-general brain regions ( ;  ;  ,  ). One network of brain regions that has been attributed to domain-general status is the cingular-opercular network. This network is defined by correlated activity in the dACC and adjacent preSMA and bilateral anterior insular and adjacent frontal operculum. This network is a subsystem of the multiple demand cortex volume that is associated with a particularly diverse range of cognitive demands ( ;  ,  ). Notably, and of relevance to recovery after stroke, we have previously reported that this network is particularly active during intentional modes of learning ( ;  ;  ), including when learning a pseudo-language consisting of novel word-picture associations (Sliwinska   et al.  , submitted for publication). \n\nOne cross-sectional study by   specifically addressed the contribution of the dACC node of the cingular-opercular network to language outcomes in chronic aphasic patients. The activity in the dACC and adjacent superior frontal gyrus in the chronic phase during a language task was positively correlated with performance on an out-of-scanner overt picture description task. This was interpreted as showing increased activation of the cingular-opercular network during increased task difficulty in patients. Two further studies in chronic aphasic stroke patients have confirmed that (i) the activity in this network is upregulated when aphasic patients perform a language task ( ); and (ii) activity in the subregions of this network, including dACC and right insula cortex, are correlated with improvement after picture naming training ( ). As far as we are aware the only longitudinal study that has suggested a link between activity in dACC/PreSMA region and short-term spontaneous recovery is that by  . They showed that the recovery of language function over the first 2 weeks after stroke shows a positive correlation with the change in activity in this region over the same period. The current study extends these works in four critical ways. \n\nFirst, the current study was specifically designed to address the contribution of domain-general brain regions to language recovery and thus included a non-verbal functional MRI task that was used to identify the domain-general region of interest. Notably, the patients, as a group, did not activate this region significantly relative to rest during the speech production task itself, although age-matched healthy controls did (see region number 3, Figure 1 in  ). This suggests a link between aphasic stroke and ability to engage this brain region during language processing, perhaps as a result of structural disconnection from upstream or downstream regions. \n\nSecond, we were able to show that activity level related positively to the magnitude of recovery whilst taking into account the additional effects of the initial severity of aphasia (based on the early language measure) and of age. These were selected to be the most significant confounding factors amongst a number of potential demographic, and stroke-related factors. Suggesting that a polymarker that is based on all three measures could potentially provide a subacute phase tool for approximating the subsequent recovery. \n\nThird, we examined a different longitudinal time window to the abovementioned longitudinal study, namely from early after stroke (\u223c2 weeks) to 4 months after ictus. This is important because the first 2 weeks after stroke is a time that is prone to rapid changes in vascular reactivity that can confound the results. We have previously analysed the vascular reactivity of the current cohort and concluded that the changes in activity over the study time are not confounded by changes in vascular reactivity. This was made possible by including a breath-hold functional MRI paradigm at each functional MRI session ( ). \n\nFourth, we were able to show that the absolute level of activation at each time point (i.e. during both the early and the late scan) had a positive predictive value of spontaneous recovery over the first 4 months after stroke; this predictive relationship is important because it means that a measure of domain-general functional activity early after stroke could potentially be used as a neuroimaging biomarker together with other factors to predict longer term outcome. \n\nOur analyses focused on testing a specific prediction of our hypothesis that the preSMA/dACC is involved in the language recovery process. It is worth noting that we did not observe a relationship between recovery and activity within other parts of the cingular-opercular network, namely the bilateral anterior insula and frontal operculum. This may partly be a methodological effect as we excluded the majority of the left perisylvian region as this had been lesioned in a number of patients. \n\nThe observed relationship of reduced preSMA/dACC activity and recovery is likely to have relationship with brain structure. It could be due to (i) pre-existing pathology, for instance small vessel disease or undiagnosed neurodegenerative disease burden; (ii) a simple relationship as a direct result of stroke lesion volume; and (iii) a more complicated relationship as an indirect result of the stroke disrupting the inputs to this region. While this is an important question to address, it is beyond the scope of the current study and would be suited to a much larger scale study that allows for nuanced multivariate analyses. Nevertheless, we were able to show that the effect of preSMA/dACC on recovery does not have a simple relationship with the overall lesion volume. \n\nBased on the results presented here, and the observation of increased cingular-opercular network activity during difficult language tasks ( ,  ) and during various modes of learning ( ;  ;  ) including when learning a pseudo-language (Sliwinska   et al.  , submitted for publication), we believe that this network is likely to be a good target candidate for experimental therapeutics including neurostimulation. Within this network, the dACC/preSMA is a particularly attractive target because it is usually spared after aphasic stroke within the left middle cerebral artery territory. Thus, enhancing midline activity in dACC/preSMA, or the connectivity within the cingular-opercular network, could accelerate language recovery. It also is targetable even via non-invasive neurostimulation techniques, whereas other nodes of this network are less accessible. Indeed taking a network-based approach to stimulate functionally linked brain regions has been shown to improve outcomes after neurostimulation in various pathological states ( ) and in aphasia ( ). Moreover, we have reported in a parallel piece of research that transcranial magnetic stimulation of dACC/preSMA accelerates the learning of a novel pseudo-language consisting of psuedoword-picture pairs (Sliwinska   et al.  , submitted for publication). Given the broad cognitive role of this network, we believe that the therapeutic potential for this network could extend to recovery from various forms of brain damage. Testing this hypothesis forms the basis of our future work. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: awx134-T1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tHealthy controls\tPatients T1\tPatients T2\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\t(n = 24)\t(n = 27)\t(n = 27)\nIn-scanner performance\tIn-scanner performance\tIn-scanner performance\tIn-scanner performance\nLanguage measure\t7.6 \u00b1 1.6\t3.6 \u00b1 2.6**\t4.7 \u00b1 1.8\u00a7\u00a7\nSyllable rate (syllable/s)\t2.7 \u00b1 0.6\t1.5 \u00b1 0.7**\t1.7 \u00b1 0.6???\nDecision task (% correct responses)\t1 \u00b1 0.04\t0.95 \u00b1 0.1\t0.98 \u00b1 0.0\nDecision task (mean reaction time, ms)\t0.37 \u00b1 0.1\t0.43 \u00b1 0.1???\t0.40 \u00b1 0.1\u00a7\u00a7\nAssessments\tAssessments\tAssessments\tAssessments\nCognitive score (38)\t37.7 \u00b1 0.6\t33.8 \u00b1 4.7**\t36.7 \u00b1 1.8???\nVerbal fluency (semantic and phonetic)\t42.9 \u00b1 9.8\t16.7 \u00b1 13.6**\t28.5 \u00b1 12.5\u00a7\u00a7\nRavens Matrix (12)\t11.7 \u00b1 0.5\t10.1 \u00b1 2.2???\t11.0 \u00b1 1.7\u00a7\u00a7\nSpontaneous Speech\t25.9 \u00b1 2.5\t13.0 \u00b1 7.5**\t18.7 \u00b1 6\u00a7\u00a7\nComprehension of Written language (53/62)\t\t47.9 \u00b1 15.6\t58.1 \u00b1 5.1\u00a7\u00a7\nComprehension of Spoken language (56/62)\t\t55.0 \u00b1 11.5\t62.4 \u00b1 4.2\u00a7\u00a7\nRepetition (67/74)\t\t56.9 \u00b1 19.1\t68.2 \u00b1 6.8???\nObject naming (51/58)\t\t44.5 \u00b1 15.4\t54.7 \u00b1 4.7\u00a7\u00a7\nReading (58/70)\t\t50.3 \u00b1 24.4\t64.1 \u00b1 8.1\u00a7\u00a7\nSpoken picture description (>33)\t\t52.3 \u00b1 33.4\t79.0 \u00b1 36.8\u00a7\u00a7\n### Caption\nIn-scanner performance and behavioural assessments\n### Footer\nNumbers in brackets accompanying the assessments refer to (aphasia \u2018cut-off\u2019 score / maximum possible score).

The effect of changing this visual feedback in virtual reality settings is currently unknown. In this study, 19 healthy right-handed adults performed index finger movements (\u201caction\u201d) and observed movements (\u201cobservation\u201d) with four different types of visual feedback: a simple circular cursor (CU), a point light (PL) pattern indicating finger joint positions, a shadow cartoon hand (SH) and a realistic VH. Finger movements were recorded using a data glove, and eye-tracking was recorded optically. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both action and observation conditions showed stronger fMRI signal responses in the occipitotemporal cortex compared to baseline. The action conditions additionally elicited elevated bilateral activations in motor, somatosensory, parietal, and cerebellar regions. For both conditions, feedback of a hand with a moving finger (SH, VH) led to higher activations than CU or PL feedback, specifically in early visual regions and the occipitotemporal cortex. Our results show the stronger recruitment of a network of cortical regions during visually guided finger movements with human hand feedback when compared to a visually incomplete hand and abstract feedback. This information could have implications for the design of visually guided tasks involving human body parts in both research and application or training-related paradigms. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nVisually guided arm and hand movements are common in many computer-mediated interactions for motor research, training, and entertainment (Mattar and Gribble,  ; Archambault et al.,  ). Such interactions typically use cursors (Oreja-Guevara et al.,  ; Veilleux and Proteau,  ), often in the form of simple circles, to provide feedback on the current position of the endpoint of the hand and arm. Feedback in the form of a cursor carries enough information for the central nervous system to plan and execute the required movements if the task accomplishment only depends on the position of the cursor. However, visual cues that are more realistic could conceivably improve performance in these movement scenarios. Previous studies showed that seeing a hand for a short period at movement initiation, either real (Veilleux and Proteau,  ) or virtual (Sober and Sabes,  ), led to higher accuracy during goal-directed target reaching. Based on these results, we previously experimented on adults comparing different forms of online feedback during visually guided finger movements in a finger-reaching task. We found that providing hand, virtual hand (VH) or shadow hand (SH) instead of point light (PL) or cursor (CU) feedback resulted in significantly faster movement initiation for three out of the four comparisons (not for VH vs. PL; Brand et al.,  ). Hence, the results of our previous study suggested that hand feedback might play an important role in visually guided movement control and in its underlying brain processes. However, no study has investigated the differences in brain activation between hand and cursor feedback during reaching movements. \n\nAlso, it has not yet been determined whether observing a hand movement will lead to the same or different brain activations than performing the same hand movement. Rizzolatti and collaborators found in monkey ventral premotor (PMv or F5) and in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) so-called \u201cmirror neurons,\u201d which fired not only during the monkey\u2019s hand movement but also during observation of the same movement performed by the experimenter (Rizzolatti et al.,  ,  ). The question of whether these cortical two brain regions in humans would also respond to observation of the hand movements has been investigated in a wealth of brain imaging publications. One of the first studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) demonstrated that observation leads to activation in several regions, namely bilateral premotor and also parietal cortices (Buccino et al.,  ). Iacoboni et al. ( ) also revealed that two human brain regions (i.e., inferior frontal and inferior parietal cortex) had mirror neurons properties, as they responded similarly for movement observation, imitation, and execution. These regions were named the mirror neuron system (MNS; Rizzolatti et al.,  ) or the action observation network (Buccino et al.,  ). Several further publications also reported activations only for observation of hand actions outside of the MNS, such as in the sensorimotor cortex (Szameitat et al.,  ) as well as in visual regions (Orlov et al.,  ; Bracci et al.,  ). \n\nIn an early positron emission tomography experiment (PET), observation of grasping movements was delivered for three different types of hand feedback: real hand (RH), high-quality visual reality VRH, and low-quality VRL feedback (Perani et al.,  ). For all three experimental conditions, a large number of brain regions, some visual and others in the parietal lobe were activated. Enhancement in brain activation only occurred in the right IPL for watching real hand compared to virtual hand actions. Yet, an agent performed the movements in the scanner room and this could have induced other effects than purely feedback related ones. Other more recent publications also reported activation not only in the IPL but also in the anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and in the prefrontal cortex in visually guided grasping and in hand movements (Shmuelof and Zohary,  ; Pilgramm et al.,  ). \n\nThere is further evidence that action observation of moving objects and hands lead to neural responses outside of the MNS (Engel et al.,  ) in higher visual cortex (Kaneko et al.,  ) and sensorimotor areas (Szameitat et al.,  ). Using fMRI, it was found that the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) is involved in the observation of stimuli including hands (Grill-Spector et al.,  ; Culham et al.,  ). It was also reported that the lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) shows closely overlapping fMRI signals for observation of hands and tools (Bracci et al.,  ). Further, the visual area hMT+ plays a role in biological motion perception (Grezes,  ; Grossman and Blake,  ; Michels et al.,  ), including visually guided hand movements (Oreja-Guevara et al.,  ). The extrastriate body area (EBA)\u2014a part of the occipitotemporal cortex (OTC)\u2014is known for responding selectively to the observation of human bodies or body parts, including hands (Downing et al.,  ; Taylor et al.,  ). Importantly, the EBA can distinguish between self-generated and other generated hand movements, indicating that this region is not only responsive during the observation of visual stimuli (David et al.,  ). \n\nIn the present fMRI study, we investigated brain activations associated with various visual feedback conditions actively and observed performed visually guided finger movements. By applying a virtual reality mediated feedback during the action, we could test for the impact of self-performed hand movements using very sparse (cursor and point-light) to realistic displays of index finger movements (shadow and virtual hand). We expected that execution as well as observation of hand movements would lead to the strongest activation during the realistic display of a hand. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-seven healthy paid volunteers participated in the study. We excluded eight subjects for the following reasons: two volunteers were co-authors, that were aware of the study hypotheses; two other volunteers demonstrated significant head motion (>3 mm in translation); in another four volunteers, coil artifacts were observed in the structural MRI. The remaining 19 subjects (seven females) were all right-handed as evaluated using the Edinburgh inventory (Oldfield,  ) and had a normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Subjects were on average 27.9 years (SD 7.4 years) old and provided written informed consent before participation. Our study was accepted by the Kantonale Ethikkommission Z\u00fcrich and experiments were conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Technical Setup \n  \nThe experiment setup is visualized in  . Parts of the setup have previously been described in our previous study (Brand et al.,  ). The experiment was performed with subjects lying in a wide bore (70 cm diameter) magnetic resonance scanner. Subjects fixated a rigid plastic tube in a power grip with their right hand. The tube was fixed to the scanner bed to assist in keeping the hand in a comfortable neutral position. This ensured that hand and finger positions were approximately consistent across participants. Tubes with three different diameters (5.1, 4.7, and 4.3 cm) were used to adjust for varying hand sizes. Index finger movements were recorded using a 5DT Data Glove 5 MRI (5DT Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) . We used Unity3D (version 3, Unity Technologies, San Francisco, CA, USA)  for data acquisition, data processing, and presentation of real-time visual feedback. Movement as well as task feedback were presented in real-time on an LCD monitor, which participants were able to observe   via   a mirror. An Eyelink 1000 long-range video oculography system (SR-Research Limited, ON, Canada)  was mounted underneath the monitor to record the movements of one eye. A nine-point calibration routine for the tracker was executed at the beginning of the experiment; data were recorded at 500 Hz. \n  \nIllustration of the experimental setup.   (A)   In the MRI, participants wearing a data glove and grasping a tube (with the right hand). Visual feedback was delivered   via   mirror projection from a monitor.   (B)   Visual feedback consisted of the display of the starting position (light-blue circle), of the movement cursor (skin-colored circle, approximately Type III on the Fitzpatrick scale), and the target (red circle) on grey background.   (C\u2013F)   The experiment comprised eight conditions, with four different types of visual feedback.   (C)   Cursor (CU),   (D)   point light (PL),   (E)   shadow hand (SH), and   (F)   virtual hand (VH) feedback. \n  \nData from the sensor glove was acquired at 75 Hz. A moving average filter was applied for smoothing the input data over a 100 ms window. Smoothing was employed to remove the high-frequency noise from the sensory input, but we also added a delay of 50 ms to the recorded user input, which was not noticed by participants, as stated after the experiment. At every smoothed input sample, the three index finger joint angles were inferred using a lookup table. The angles were then applied to a realistic virtual hand model. Realistic joint angles of the finger flexion-extension movement task were acquired using motion capturing (Vicon, USA) in a separate single participant study preceding this experiment. In the pre-study, the single participant performed the movement task outside of the scanner and the joint angle mapping data for the movement was stored in the lookup table. Before the experiment, the sensor glove was calibrated for every subject at 100% and 0% index finger extension. The task was performed in the 95% to 5% index finger extension range. We report distances relative to this movement range in the course of this article. \n\nA realistic virtual hand model from the 5DT data glove software was used (2,450 polygons) for visual feedback of the finger movements. Virtual spheres, sized to approximate the thickness of the real index finger, were placed on the virtual index fingertip and finger joint positions. Four distinct hand feedback types were defined: \n\nCU ( ): invisible hand model, the tip of the index finger visible as a sphere (flat flesh-colored shading, orthographic 2D projection) \n\nPL ( ): invisible hand model, spheres on the joints of the index finger visible (flat flesh-colored shading, orthographic 2D projection) \n\nSH ( ): visible hand model with moving index finger, all spheres invisible (flat flesh-colored shading, perspective 3D projection) \n\nVH ( ): visible RH model with moving index finger, all spheres invisible (realistic shading, perspective 3D projection) \n\nWe adjusted the visual angle of the task range on the screen for every subject to match the visual angle of the real finger movements in the lying task position. \n\n\n### Experimental Protocol \n  \nSubjects were instructed to either observe or control the movements of the virtual index finger (hand or circles) projected on the screen. During the action conditions, participants controlled the virtual hand and circle stimuli by extending and flexing their right index finger. They were instructed to move the index finger and to stabilize the other fingers by holding the tube. During the observation conditions, subjects were resting their hand by holding the tube and they watched the pre-recorded and animated movements of the virtual effector on the screen. To control for finger and eye movements, we recorded sensor glove and eye-tracker data throughout the whole experiment (during the action as well as observation conditions). The task started with moving the cursor represented by a blue circle into the starting position ( ). After two s, the trial started with a red target circle appearing at a pseudo-random location (between 40\u201350% finger extensions). Starting and target position circles were displayed in different colors to facilitate distinguishing between the two visual positions, especially in observation conditions. In action conditions, participants were instructed to move the cursor as fast and accurately as possible to the target, and immediately back to the starting position. Each trial lasted 2 s, with the target circle disappearing after 1 s. The trials were grouped in blocks of nine and each block lasted 22 s comprised of 2 s task instruction, 2 s for moving the cursor into the starting position, and followed by nine trials of 2 s duration each. The blocks were interleaved with in-between resting periods of pseudo-random length (7\u20139 s, average 8 s) showing a blue fixation cross. The whole experiment consisted of eight conditions, each comprising ten blocks. Each condition contained a different feedback type for the task ( ) and additionally differed in whether subjects observed or performed (action) the movements. \n\nRandomly, one action and one observation condition were assigned to one of four scanning runs, such that by pseudo-random selection either the same feedback type or two different feedback types were used within one run. Within the runs, respective action and the observation condition blocks were presented in random order. To instruct subjects on the task, either the word \u201caction\u201d in red or the word \u201cobservation\u201d in green was presented for 2 s before each block. In between runs, participants were allowed to take a short break, if required. The whole experiment lasted for approximately 1 h, including setup time. \n\n\n### Behavioral and Eye Data Analysis \n  \nFor behavioral and eye movement data analysis we used the same methodology as in our previously published behavioral study (Brand et al.,  ). Please refer to the previously published article for a detailed description of the procedure. In total, for behavioral data, we calculated four psychometric parameters for each index finger movement: movement amplitude, movement extent error (Euclidean distance between the virtual index fingertip and the target center), total movement time, and reaction time. Reaction time was operationalized as the time between stimulus presentation and visual movement onset. Movement onset was detected when 10% of the distance from the starting position to the target distance was exceeded. The parameter of movement onset and therefore reaction time includes the 50 ms lag of the moving average filter. For eye movements, we calculated seven parameters: number of saccades, fixations, blinks, horizontal and vertical gaze amplitude, median horizontal, and vertical gaze velocity. Statistical testing for the factor Condition was performed using the appropriate parametric (one-way repeated measures ANOVA or paired   t  -test) or non-parametric test (Friedman test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test). \n\n\n### fMRI Data Acquisition \n  \nScans were acquired using a Philips Ingenia 3.0 Tesla MR scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) with a Philips 32-element head coil. Functional blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) sensitive images were obtained using a single-shot gradient-echo EPI (Mansfield,  ) pulse sequence (slices = 32, slice scan order: interleaved, repetition time = 2.2 s, echo time = 35 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, field of view = 230 \u00d7 230 mm , reconstruction voxel size = 2.9 \u00d7 2.9 \u00d7 4.4 mm , scan matrix 64 \u00d7 64). The images were recorded in an oblique axial orientation to reduce signal dropout and covered the whole brain. To homogenize the BOLD sensitivity of the fMRI scan, we applied sensitivity encoding with a reduction factor of one. Additionally, the possible number of slices acquired within one TR was maximized. Following the functional scans an anatomical scan was acquired, using a sagittal 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo sequence (slices = 170, repetition time = 8.2 ms, echo time = 3.8 ms, flip angle = 8 degrees, field of view = 240 mm, voxel size = 0.94 \u00d7 0.94 \u00d7 1 mm, scan matrix 240 \u00d7 240). All images covered the whole brain. Each run lasted 10 min and 49 s and contained an observation and action condition. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Analysis \n  \nWe analysed the fMRI data with SPM8 . We discarded the first three dummy images of every fMRI run to obtain a magnetization steady-state and performed the following pre-processing steps: realignment to the calculated mean image, segmentation, normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template and smoothing by an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full-width at half maximum. The data was high-pass filtered with a cut-off frequency of 1/128 Hz. Subsequently, we performed for each participant a first-level trial-based analysis with a general linear model (GLM) as implemented in SPM8. For each subject, the design matrix consisted of eight regressors, corresponding to the trial onsets and durations (2 s) of the eight conditions, four amplitude parametric modulators, coding movement amplitude in the action conditions as described in the behavioral data analysis section and four constants for each fMRI run. The amplitude parametric modulators were included to remove global amplitude effects from the signal. The trial-based assessment of movement amplitude has been described previously (Brand et al.,  ). Subsequently, the regressors and parametric modulators were convolved with the hemodynamic response function. Also, we used eye movement parameters (i.e., number and durations of saccades, fixations, eye blinks as well as the amplitude and velocity in the translational and horizontal direction) as nuisance variables (covariate of no interest) in the second-level analysis. \n\nThe fit of the GLM to the observed activity yielded parameter estimates for every subject, voxel, and regressor or parametric modulator. The beta values represent an estimate of activation for regressors and an interaction estimate of regressor activation with parameter value for parametric modulators. We then calculated the t-contrasts of each estimated regressor or parametric modulator compared to baseline. All resting periods of 7\u20139 s (average 8 s) in between blocks and 30 s at the beginning and the end of each fMRI run served as baseline for the GLM. \n\nWe entered the resulting beta images into a second-level random-effects group analysis. The second-level design matrix consisted of eight regressors stemming from two factors of two and four levels, respectively. In particular, we used a 2 \u00d7 4 factorial design for the two-way ANCOVA with the factors   Condition   (action and observation) and   Feedback   (VH, SH, PL, and CU) to examine main and interaction effects. We also performed a conjunction analysis for factor   Condition  . As described, eye movement parameters were used as a nuisance variable. In the case of significant main effects (  F  -test),   post hoc   t-contrasts (paired, one-tailed) were performed. General task activations were assessed by calculating t-contrasts of combined action or observation regressors to baseline. For all analyses, we used the SPM implemented family-wise error (FWE) correction to find activated voxel-clusters with an overall type I error level of   p   < 0.05. The results were visualized on a cortical surface using the (PALS)-B12 atlas (Van Essen,  ) and the software Caret (Van Essen et al.,  ). \n\nWe defined four literature-driven regions of interest (ROIs) in the left hemisphere with center coordinates taken from previous publications (see  ). MNI (MNI space) transformed coordinates for the EBA were taken from Orlov et al. ( ), for area hMT+ from Spiridon et al. ( ), for the LOC from Grill-Spector et al. ( ) and the LOTC from Bracci et al. ( ). To compare activations in the ROIs across conditions first-level beta values were extracted using MarsBaR 0.43  from 6 mm spheres around the peak coordinates for every subject and regressor. The ROI data were compared for feedback-specific effects by one-way repeated-measures ANOVAs and paired   t  -tests or by their non-parametric counterparts Friedman-tests and paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. \n  \nMNI coordinates used as centers for the ROI analysis with corresponding references. \n  \n EBA, extrastriate body area as part of the; OTC, occipitotemporal complex; hMT+, human area MT+; LOC, lateral occipital complex; LOTC, lateral occipitotemporal cortex  . \n  \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Data \n  \nOverall, participants performed similar movements for the four visual feedback action conditions. In our previous article on 26 participants, we found faster reaction times (for three out of four comparisons), larger movement amplitudes, and larger movement extent errors for the hand compared to the circle conditions (Brand et al.,  ). Likewise, the behavioural results of the 19 participants studied in this article, revealed significant differences in one-way repeated measures ANOVAs for factor   Condition   in movement amplitude (  F   = 119.66,   p   < 0.001), movement extent error (  F   = 129.03,   p   < 0.001), and reaction time (  F   = 7.24,   p   < 0.001), but no significant effect on movement time. \n\nAdditionally, in line with our previous report, movement amplitude was significantly larger in the two hand feedback conditions than in the two circle conditions (VH > PL,   t   = 12.40,   p   < 0.001; VH > CU,   t   = 13.18,   p   < 0.001; SH > PL,   t   = 11.77,   p   < 0.001; all   t  -tests; SH > CU,   V   = 190.00,   p   < 0.001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Accordingly was movement extent error (VH > PL,   t   = 12.89,   p   < 0.001; VH > CU,   t   = 13.32,   p   < 0.001; SH > PL,   t   = 11.98,   p   < 0.001; SH > CU,   t   = 14.11,   p   < 0.001; all   t  -test). \n\nAs in our previous article, reaction time was significantly shorter for SH than for CU and point light conditions (PL > SH,   t   = 3.00,   p   = 0.010; CU > SH,   t   = 4.34,   p   = 0.002;   t  -tests). However, different to our previous study with 26 participants, in this study we could not find a significant effect on reaction time for virtual hand compared to cursor (CU > VH,   t   = 2.96,   p   = 0.050;   t  -test). All tests were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. \n\nTo support our neuroimaging hypothesis, which compared both hand conditions combined to both circle conditions combined, we also investigated this contrast in behavior. In Bonferroni corrected   t  -tests, we found significantly larger movement amplitude (hands > circles,   t   = 16.02,   p   < 0.001) and movement extent error (hands > circles,   t   = 16.03,   p   < 0.001) as well as shorter reaction time for hand compared to circle conditions (circles > hands,   t   = 4.07,   p   < 0.001). \n\n\n### Eye-Tracking Data \n  \nThe median position of the subjects\u2019 tracked eye stayed close to the endpoint of the controlled effector (circle or index finger) for all conditions. In median trajectories, differences between conditions and overruns were small, while differences between individuals were large. We investigated the differences between conditions with parameters acquired from the eye-tracking trace trial-by-trial. As the data was not normally distributed, non-parametric tests (Friedman or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) were used and the   p  -values were Bonferroni corrected for the number of tests performed. We did not find any differences for factor   Feedback   for none of the assessed parameters, neither for action nor for observation. However, for factor   Condition   (separating action from observation conditions), the number of saccades, fixations, and blinks were significantly different (all   p   < 0.05, Friedman tests).   Post hoc   analyses with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed a greater number of saccades (  V   = 175,   p   < 0.001), fixations (  V   = 179,   p   < 0.001) and blinks (  V   = 190,   p   < 0.001) during observation than action. \n\n\n### fMRI Data \n  \n#### General Task Activation\u2014Whole-Brain Analysis \n  \nIn the final sample of subjects (  n   = 19), head movements were small (all slice-specific translation values < 2 mm; rotation <2 degrees). The 2 \u00d7 4 ANCOVA yielded significant main effects for the factors   Condition   (  F   = 11.3,   p   < 0.001,   F  -test) and   Feedback   (  F   = 5.7,   p   < 0.001,   F  -test) but no interaction effects. We first analyzed the BOLD signal of all action and observation conditions and compared them to the baseline to assess general task effects. Both action and observation conditions activated the bilateral OTC ( ). Also, the conjunction analysis revealed a similar bilateral cluster in the OTC shown in ( ). The action conditions additionally activated bilateral cortical (motor, premotor, somatosensory, and parietal) and cerebellar regions (not shown) as well as ipsilateral thalamic regions ( ). These were located in the primary motor and somatosensory cortex, dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), PMv, supplementary motor area (SMA), precuneus, IPL, and in the cerebellum. \n  \nGroup-activations of action > baseline (blue) and of observation, > baseline (green) both overlaid on a rendered brain.   (A)   Left lateral,   (B)   right lateral,   (C)   left medial, and   (D)   right medial view. Primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortex, dorsal (PMd) and ventral (PMv) premotor cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), precuneus, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), occipitotemporal cortex (OTC), and cerebellum predominantly activated. Activations are shown at   p   < 0.05 (FWE corrected). \n  \n\n#### Feedback Effect\u2014Whole-Brain Analysis \n  \n Post hoc   t-contrasts (paired, one-tailed) were then performed for the factor   Feedback   the following   post hoc   T-contrasts for each condition: VH vs. SH, SH vs. PL and PL vs. CU. Significant activations were only found for SH > PL and PL > CU in both action and observation conditions (  and  ). \n  \nIllustration of the significant BOLD signal differences comparing feedback types. Activations are shown for both action   (A\u2013C)   and observation   (D\u2013F)   conditions overlaid on a left lateral rendered brain. Right-hemispheric activations were small and not shown. Activations of all plots were FWE corrected (  p   < 0.05). This figure illustrates that during the action and observation realistic displays of a human hand (SH and VH) activate the visual cortex more strongly than point-light (PL) or cursor (CU) displays. \n    \nPeak activations for the action and observation conditions. \n  \n Hands summarize VH and SH. Circles summarize PL and CU. All results presented at   p   < 0.05 (FWE corrected) and peak voxels reported in MNI coordinates. The reported brain regions correspond to regions of the Anatomy Toolbox 2.2 (Eickhoff et al.,  )  . \n  \nThe SH > PL comparison significantly activated the lingual gyrus in both action and observation conditions. In action, the single activation cluster was larger in the number of activated voxels compared to observation and extended into the inferior occipital gyrus. \n\nPL > CU activated the lingual and fusiform gyrus for action and observation with the peak for action lying in the fusiform gyrus and the one for observation in the lingual gyrus (  and  ). \n\nSH > PL and PL > CU had no overlap in both action and observation conditions. \n\nTo investigate the effect of seeing a hand on activations, we compared hands (VH, SH) vs. circles (PL, CU) by combining both hands as well as both circle conditions. The contrast hands > circles yielded significant activations in several brain regions (  and  ). \n\nThe hands > circles contrasts of both action and observation had an activation cluster in the left (contralateral) occipital lobe, mainly in the lingual gyrus. For the action conditions, this cluster extended into the fusiform gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and cuneus. Additional activation clusters for action were found in the left precuneus and cuneus. The hands > circles activations contained all SH > PL activations, but not all PL > CU activations. \n\nIn summary, we found stronger activations for feedback of hands than circles during both action and observation conditions, with larger activations in action. Many of these regions were also significantly activated by the SH > PL comparison. Disjoint from the SH > PL activations we found significantly higher BOLD signals for PL > CU feedback in early visual regions. \n\n\n\n### ROI Analysis \n  \nAs shown in  , the EBA showed significant activation differences between hand and cursor conditions in action (VH vs. CU,   t   = 4.49,   p   = 0.002; SH vs. CU,   t   = 3.84,   p   = 0.007;   t  -tests) and observation (VH vs. CU,   V   = 164,   p   = 0.024; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; SH vs. CU,   t   = 6.24,   p   < 0.001;   t  -test). We also found a significant difference between VH and PL in action (  V   = 183,   p   < 0.001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and between SH and PL in observation (  t   = 3.28,   p   = 0.025;   t  -test). \n  \nActivations in four literature-driven (EBA, hMT+, LOC, and LOTC, see  ) left-hemispheric ROIs. Beta value means and standard errors extracted for VH (black), SH (gray), PL (dark red), and CU (light red) conditions during both action (top) and observation (bottom). Asterisks indicate significant changes between conditions (  p   < 0.05). Abbreviations: EBA, extrastriate body area; hMT+, human area MT+; LOC, lateral occipital complex; LOTC, lateral occipitotemporal complex. This figure indicates that during the action and observation realistic displays of a human hand (SH and VH) activate the literature-driven ROIs more strongly than point-light (PL) or cursor (CU) displays. \n  \nActivation in hMT+ was higher for hands than for circles in action (VH vs. PL,   V   = 180,   p   < 0.001; VH vs. CU,   V   = 162,   p   = 0.032; Wilcoxon signed-rank tests; SH vs. PL,   t   = 3.00,   p   = 0.046;   t  -test; SH vs. CU,   V   = 173,   p   = 0.005; Wilcoxon signed-rank test).The LOC showed a decreasing activation gradient from VH to CU conditions in action ( ). Significant differences were found between the two hand conditions and the CU (VH vs. CU,   t   = 4.97,   p   < 0.001;   t  -test; SH vs. CU,   V   = 176,   p   = 0.003; Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and for VH compared to PL (  V   = 163,   p   = 0.027; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In observation, differences were only significant for SH vs. CU (  t   = 4.92,   p   < 0.001;   t  -test). \n\nFor the LOTC, we found stronger fMRI responses for the   Feedback   types \u201chands\u201d compared to \u201ccircles\u201d for both action and observation. Significant differences were seen for action for two comparisons (VH vs. PL,   V   = 164,   p   < 0.024; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; VH vs. CU,   t   = 3.74   p   = 0.009;   t  -test). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe main aim of this study was to examine whether neuronal engagement depends on the realism of a human hand during action and observation. We found main effects of   Feedback   and   Condition  , but no interaction effects. This indicates that fMRI signal responses were different in action (visually guided hand movements) and observation and differed between feedback types. However, BOLD responses were similarly modulated by the different feedback types for action and observation. As expected, seeing a hand representation while performing index finger movements activated the known relevant sensorimotor and visual brain regions (when controlling for movement amplitude and eye movement parameters). Activations in visual regions were stronger for VH movements than for moving PL. The difference between the two types of hand feedback representations did not lead to measurable differences in brain activation. The observation did not activate as many regions as action and the activation was weaker during displays of moving PL. These results suggest that the engagement of the brain during virtually guided index finger movements is stronger and spatially more extended during the display of a hand compared to various PL displays. Unexpectedly, regions of the MNS were not seen during observation using our experimental design. Our results thus clearly suggest that visual feedback of virtually guided hand movements can robustly activate the MNS and the visual cortex. This finding might help to design experiments in which robust neuronal responses of the visual cortex are required. \n\n### Action vs. Observation: Regional Differences in Brain Activation \n  \nIn all four literature-derived ROIs (EBA, hMT+, LOC, and LOTC), we found stronger activation for a moving hand (VH and SH) compared to moving circle stimuli (PL and CU). For action and observation, the whole-brain comparison between hand (VH or SH) and circle (PL or CU) activated left occipital and occipitotemporal (LOC and LOTC) regions. The OTC is known for processing visual information about the human body (Downing et al.,  ,  ; Taylor et al.,  ; Lingnau and Downing,  ). This region has also been associated with action observation and performance (Caspers et al.,  ; Lingnau and Downing,  ) and has been proposed as an MNS region (Molenberghs et al.,  , ). Regions for visual processing of the body or body parts are known to exist in EBA (Downing et al.,  ) and FBA (Peelen and Downing,  ), which are both parts of the OTC. In our experiment, a hand display activates EBA more strongly than the two types of circle conditions during both action and observation. This is consistent with studies reporting EBA activation for observation of static as well as moving hands (Taylor et al.,  ; Op de Beeck et al.,  ; Orlov et al.,  ). Nevertheless, these studies only compared observation of hands to observation of objects. Our results extend their findings, as in our study EBA was active during both action and observation of hands compared to PL displays. \n\nWe found that only during the action, hMT+ was activated for all hands and circle conditions. Studies have revealed that sub-regions of hMT+ also respond to the motion in other sensory modalities, such as tactile motion (Lingnau and Downing,  ). Thus, being considered a motion-processing region, one would expect hMT+ to be activated equally for all feedback types, and both action and observation. However, activations for PL and CU were significantly smaller during action compared to those for hand conditions. This finding could be related to a previous study that found hMT+ responding more strongly to the motion of body parts than to other objects (Spiridon et al.,  ). There is evidence that macaque\u2019s MT is involved when motion energy is integrated into the visual field (global motion; Salzman et al.,  ; Pasternak and Merigan,  ), which is especially the case for the hand conditions in our experiment. Further, it has been proposed that hMT+ activations depend on the level of implicit motion (Kable et al.,  ). Hence, processing of motion from own actions\u2014like in our action condition\u2014might be different from the processing of motion from pre-recorded actions like in our observation, as the amount of implicit motion is absent in this condition. Feedback from own performed motion is required for visuomotor control by enhancing internal movement models (Shadmehr and Krakauer,  ). \n\nEspecially for action, LOC activations were significantly stronger for the hand than circle conditions. Our results extend previous imaging findings showing that the LOC responds more to real objects compared to scrambled objects (Grill-Spector et al.,  ). During the observation, activation was the strongest for SH feedback and significantly different from CU feedback. Thus, any difference could be explained by the presence of a moving hand. \n\nIn line with previous reports (Bracci et al.,  ,  ), we found hand-selective responses in the left LOTC, most pronounced for the VH condition during both   Feedback   types. Our results thus indicate that brain activation is driven by the observation of whole integrated real finger movements and visually guided real finger movements, and not by the movements of subparts of the hand (abstract subparts of the finger). \n\n\n### Behavioral and Eye-Tracking Data \n  \nWe found differences between the four action conditions in three psychophysical parameters: finger movement amplitude, extent error, and reaction time. Some of these results were previously presented (Brand et al.,  ). To remove the influence of behavioral effects on the fMRI data, we added a movement amplitude regressor of no interest as a parametric modulator to the first-level fMRI model. Our eye-tracking data analyses did not yield any significant differences between the four feedback conditions. Thus, any behavioral differences in amplitude and reaction time cannot be explained by differences in eye movements. However, differences between action and observation conditions were found in the number of saccades, fixations, and blinks, being larger for observation. This may be due to more focused attention during action than during observation. Eye movements are known to modulate activity in the frontal brain areas, such as the frontal eye field, as well as in parietal brain regions. The frontal eye field contains visual, motor, and visuomotor cells (Bruce and Goldberg,  ) essential for the preparation and triggering of eye movements. Transcranial direct current stimulation during saccade preparation over the IPS can alter general performance, e.g., during a discrimination task, which is not necessarily the case for the frontal eye field (Neggers et al.,  ; Van Ettinger-Veenstra et al.,  ). As we observed\u2014for all action conditions\u2014significant activation in somatosensory, motor, premotor, parietal, and occipitotemporal cortex even after controlling for eye movements, we would conclude that activation differences between action and observation are not the result of eye movements but is rather the result of (actively performed) visually-guided finger movements. \n\n\n### General Task Activations \n  \nControlling for movement amplitude and eye movement parameters, the visually guided finger movements significantly activated somatosensory, motor, premotor, parietal, and occipitotemporal cortex in the four action conditions ( ). In contrast, the observation of the various moving visual stimuli (hands, PL, and CU) on the screen only activated the OTC, but none of the reported MNS regions in the premotor and parietal cortex (Molenberghs et al.,  ). \n\nSeveral studies have questioned the involvement of the premotor-parietal cortical network in action observation because fMRI and PET did not all show activation in this network as clearly as in monkey experiments. There is evidence that many factors can shape and increase activity in the MNS network, such as novelty and experience (Liew et al.,  ), subtle differences in movement kinematics (Koul et al.,  ), intention and the context of observed motor action (Molenberghs et al.,  ). In an older study, individuals watched video clips showing object manipulation by the right or left hand (Shmuelof and Zohary,  ). The occipital cortex and caudal part of the parietal cortex demonstrated fMRI signal responses specific to the visual-field location of the clips. However, the response in anterior IPS was related to the identity of the observed hand. These \u201chand-specific\u201d parietal areas also demonstrated contralateral hand specificity during self-action (i.e., object manipulation) without visual feedback. The authors concluded that the anterior IPS is involved in the observation of specific hand actions, including grasping. \n\nMost important are the publications reporting meta-analysis of many fMRI studies in the context of action observation and execution (Molenberghs et al.,  ; Hardwick et al.,  ). Morin and Gr\u00e8zes ( ) reported that only observing biological actions with a physical target (compared to visual stimuli displaying no action at all) leads to consistent activation of the PMv (Morin and Gr\u00e8zes,  ). Caspers et al.\u2019s ( ) meta-analysis concluded that the activation in the PMv was only for observation objects-related actions (Caspers et al.,  ).To the same conclusion came the meta-analyses on imagery, observation, and execution by Hardwick et al. ( ), who found that one of the potential factors influencing activation in the network is the involvement of an object in the observed actions (Hardwick et al.,  ). The lack of activation in the premotor cortex in our study was surprising but could be explained by the conservative statistical threshold (  p   < 0.05, FWE) applied or is due to the missing object-related action in our experiment, in which we focused on simple reaching. \n\nWe could not find any significant difference in brain activation between realistic (VH) and less realistic (SH) hand feedback, neither during action nor during observation ( ). This is consistent with a previous study (Perani et al.,  ). Yet, our results are not in line with another result of the same study. According to their experiment, the observation of RH feedback yielded stronger activation compared to a coarse VH (close to a robotic hand). However, this surprising result might be explained by the fact that the presented hand belonged to a human agent (located in the scanner room) rather than the display of a VH on the screen. In early visual regions, we did not find any activation differences between baseline and action or observation. This was probably due to the static visual stimulus (blue fixation cross) that subjects saw during rest periods. In both action and observation conditions, we found stronger activation along the visual cortex comparing the two-hand to the two point-light feedback conditions ( ). \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nAs the four visual feedback types differed in size, this could explain some of the observed activation differences, especially in early visual regions. However, the contrast \u201cPL > CU\u201d conditions, comparing differently sized feedback, only evoked activation differences in the lingual gyrus and only during observation. Hence, it is unlikely that activation differences in the examined regions are driven by differences in the physical size of the stimuli. Also, the fMRI signal amplitudes in higher visual brain regions (ROI: EBA, hMT+, LOC, and LOTC) were stronger for all action than observation conditions. This result suggests that processing in these regions is associated with action understanding and cannot only reflect changes in the physical properties of the feedback types (Kilner,  ; Wurm et al.,  ). \n\nSecond, activation differences between hands and circles might be related to differences in behavioral parameters, as observed for movement amplitude and reaction time (Brand et al.,  ). Yet, an amplitude parametric regressor of no interest was added to the first-level fMRI design to remove possible amplitude effects from the fMRI data. \n\nThirdly, we recorded eye movement data and found that oculomotor parameters are known to be strongly correlated in humans with both alertness (blink frequency) and visual attention (fixation duration) did not significantly differ across feedback conditions. This limits the likelihood that participants\u2019 attention differed in the four feedback types and would elicit stronger BOLD signal amplitude for hands compared to circles. Also, we controlled for the impact of eye movement parameters on brain activation in the statistical model for the fMRI analysis, to minimize the impact of eye-movement-related activation on task-related activation. \n\nDifferences in luminance were not checked. However, the results clearly show that there was no activation difference between the VH and SH in all regions for action as well as observation, though potential differences in luminance. We did not record muscle activity by electromyography recordings. Yet, based on the sensor glove data we had detailed information on the movement trajectory and thus information about e.g., the movement extent error. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur study suggests that brain activation during visually guided finger movements depends on the visual representation of the movement on the screen. During action and observation, full-sized finger representations\u2014whether realistic or shadow\u2014lead to more activation in specific visual brain regions compared to point-light or cursor feedback. Our results can be important for the design of future computer-interactive and/or virtual-reality augmented training and rehabilitation systems. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Kantonale Ethikkommission Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich.

To shed more light on how aiding may impact these effects, this study explored the influence of hearing aid (HA) experience on the cognitive processes underlying speech comprehension. Eye-tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements were carried out with acoustic sentence-in-noise (SiN) stimuli complemented by pairs of pictures that either correctly (target picture) or incorrectly (competitor picture) depicted the sentence meanings. For the eye-tracking measurements, the time taken by the participants to start fixating the target picture (the \u2018processing time\u2019) was measured. For the fMRI measurements, brain activation inferred from blood-oxygen-level dependent responses following sentence comprehension was measured. A noise-only condition was also included. Groups of older hearing-impaired individuals matched in terms of age, hearing loss, and working memory capacity with (eHA;   N   = 13) or without (iHA;   N   = 14) HA experience participated. All acoustic stimuli were presented via earphones with individual linear amplification to ensure audibility. Consistent with previous findings, the iHA group had significantly longer (poorer) processing times than the eHA group, despite no differences in speech recognition performance. Concerning the fMRI measurements, there were indications of less brain activation in some right frontal areas for SiN relative to noise-only stimuli in the eHA group compared to the iHA group. Together, these results suggest that HA experience leads to faster speech-in-noise processing, possibly related to less recruitment of brain regions outside the core sentence-comprehension network. Follow-up research is needed to substantiate the findings related to changes in cortical speech processing with HA use. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAge-related hearing loss is a common chronic health condition that often remains untreated. Despite substantial advancements in hearing aid (HA) technology over the last decades, less than 25% of the hearing-impaired population over the age of 60 use HAs (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). Recently, evidence has been accumulating that untreated hearing loss can lead to declines in brain volume and compensatory changes in cortical resource allocation with important consequences for communication abilities ( ;  ;  ;  ). Concerning the influence of hearing device treatment, there is evidence for rapid adaptation in auditory cortex following cochlear implantation. For instance, a recent longitudinal study based on electroencephalography found increased amplitudes and shorter latencies of the N1 wave after 8 weeks of cochlear implant use ( ). Regarding HA provision, findings concerning cortical adaptation are inconsistent. To illustrate,   fitted groups of novice and experienced HA users with bilateral HAs and performed event-related potential measurements before and after 12 weeks of HA use. Focusing on the N1 and P2 components, these authors did not observe any changes as a result of HA use. In contrast,   fitted bilaterally hearing-impaired participants with unilateral HAs and measured blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). After 3 months of HA use, their participants showed a bilateral decrease in brain activation in auditory cortex (i.e., superior temporal gyrus). \n\nA possible explanation for the inconsistent HA results could be that they were obtained using different experimental paradigms. In a series of previous experiments, we used an eye-tracking paradigm developed by   to investigate the effects of HA experience on how quickly a participant can grasp the   meaning   of acoustic sentence-in-noise (SiN) stimuli presented together with two similar pictures that either correctly (target picture) or incorrectly (distractor picture) depict the sentence meanings. The participant\u2019s task is to identify the target picture by pressing one of two buttons after sentence presentation. The time taken for this to occur is called the \u201cresponse time.\u201d Additionally, the time taken by the participant to start fixating the target picture   during   sentence presentation is determined using an eye-tracker. This measure is referred to as the \u201cprocessing time.\u201d In a cross-sectional study, we compared experienced and inexperienced HA users matched in terms of age, pure-tone average hearing loss (PTA), and working memory capacity in terms of their response and processing times ( ). We found longer processing times for the inexperienced HA users than for the experienced HA users, despite comparable stimulus audibility and speech recognition performance. In contrast, the two groups did not differ in their response times. In a longitudinal follow-up study, we acclimatized novice users to bilateral HA fittings ( ). Before acclimatization, these participants had significantly longer processing times than a control group of experienced HA users. After 24 weeks of HA use, the processing (but not response) times of the novice users improved by almost 30%, thereby reaching the level of the controls. Together, these findings imply that HA use leads to faster speech comprehension in noise as measured using processing times. \n\nNeurophysiological research has shown that speech comprehension relies on a core frontotemporal sentence-comprehension network of brain regions that includes bilateral temporal cortex (superior temporal sulcus, middle temporal gyrus), left inferior frontal gyrus and left precentral gyrus, and (pre-) supplementary motor area (e.g.,  ;  ). The activated cortical areas appear to change with the task requirements, age, and hearing loss. For example, deciphering the meaning of sentences with different linguistic complexities leads to the recruitment of different brain regions, and the observable activation patterns vary also with age. To illustrate,   presented sentences with low or high linguistic complexity to young and older normal-hearing adults and measured BOLD responses following sentence comprehension. The participants had to press one of two buttons to identify the gender of the character performing the action in a given sentence. Both groups showed stronger activation in left inferior and middle frontal gyri, left inferior parietal cortex, and left middle temporal gyrus for high- compared to low-complexity sentences. Furthermore, relative to the younger group the older group had decreased activation in inferior frontal regions but increased activation in frontal regions outside the core sentence-comprehension network. Concerning the influence of hearing loss,   tested older adults with high-frequency audiometric hearing thresholds ranging from clinically normal to moderately elevated. They observed a negative correlation between hearing thresholds and brain activation to sentence stimuli in bilateral superior temporal gyri (including auditory cortex), thalamus, and brainstem. \n\nThe findings summarized above are consistent with the idea that both age and hearing loss lead to the recruitment of cortical areas outside the core sentence-comprehension network, possibly as a result of compensatory mechanisms for achieving speech comprehension. Because previous research did not consider the effects of HA treatment on cortical speech processing, it is currently unclear if experience with amplified sound plays a role for this. The purpose of the current study was to address this knowledge gap. First, to confirm the previously observed difference in processing times and to provide a baseline for the other measurements, we tested experienced and inexperienced HA users using the eye-tracking paradigm described above. We then performed fMRI measurements to explore differences in brain activation during speech comprehension among the two participant groups. For that purpose, we adapted the eye-tracking paradigm for BOLD response measurements. In addition, we included a noise-only condition as a reference. Based on our earlier eye-tracking results, we expected longer processing times for inexperienced compared to experienced HA users. Additionally, based on the fMRI literature summarized above, we hypothesized that our inexperienced users would show more brain activation to SiN stimuli outside the core frontotemporal sentence-comprehension network. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA total of 27 right-handed participants were recruited from a large database of hearing-impaired listeners available at the H\u00f6rzentrum Oldenburg GmbH. Thirteen of the participants were experienced HA users with at least 1 year (mean: 4.5 years;   SD  : 2.7 years) of bilateral HA experience (eHA). The other 14 participants were inexperienced HA users with no previous HA experience (iHA). Their motivation for participating in the current study was primarily due to them being able to try out HAs without any subsequent commitments. Inclusion criteria for all of these participants were (1) age between 60 and 80 years, (2) bilateral, sloping, sensorineural hearing loss in the range from 40 to 80 dB HL between 3 and 8 kHz, (3) self-reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and (4) no conditions that would be contraindicative for fMRI measurements (e.g., a pacemaker). One inexperienced subject was excluded from the fMRI analysis due to structural abnormalities identified in the anatomical scan.   summarizes the main characteristics of the two groups of participants.   shows mean hearing threshold levels. Pure-tone average hearing loss as calculated across ears for the four standard audiometric frequencies from 0.5 to 4 kHz (PTA4) was 34 and 31 dB HL for the eHA and iHA group, respectively. Two independent   t  -tests showed no group differences in terms of age (  t   = -0.01,   p   > 0.5) or PTA4 (  t   = 1.0,   p   > 0.05). \n  \nMeans (and standard deviations) for age, PTA4, reading span, and SRT80s for the two levels of linguistic complexity (low, high) and participant groups. \n    \nMean hearing threshold levels across the left and right ears of the eHA and iHA participants. \n  \n\n### Apparatus \n  \nWith the exception of the fMRI measurements, all measurements took place in a soundproof booth and were performed with a computer equipped with an RME Fireface UCX (Audio AG, Haimhausen, Germany) soundcard. For the eye-tracking measurements, the setup of   was used (EyeLink 1000 desktop system, EyeLink CL high-speed camera, SR Research, Ltd., Samsung 2253BW monitor). The visual stimuli were presented on a 22  multiscan computer monitor with a resolution of 1680 \u00d7 1050 pixels. The participants were seated such that their eyes were 60 cm in front of the monitor. Using a nine-point fixation stimulus procedure developed by the manufacturer of the eye-tracker, the setup was calibrated at the start of each block of measurements. Before each trial, the participants had to fixate a point at the center of the monitor for drift correction. The behavioral responses (i.e., button presses) of the participants were collected using a computer keyboard. All acoustic stimuli were presented via free-field equalized Sennheiser (Wennebostel, Germany) HDA200 headphones. \n\nFor the fMRI measurements, a 3 Tesla MRI system (Siemens Magnetom Prisma 3T, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil was used. Stimulus presentation and behavioral data collection was carried out using the Cogent 2000 toolbox (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience) in MATLAB, 2014a (Version 2014a, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, United States). The visual stimuli were presented via a mirror construction from a projector screen at the end of the tube with a resolution of 1280 \u00d7 1024 pixels. An fMRI-compatible button pad (LXPAD-2x5-10M, NAtA Technologies, Coquitlam, BC, Canada) was used for collecting the behavioral responses of the participants. The acoustic stimuli were presented via free-field equalized fMRI-compatible headphones (OptoACTIVE, Optoacoustics, Ltd., Or Yehuda, Israel). \n\nAll acoustic stimuli were calibrated with a Br\u00fcel & Kj\u00e6r (B&K; N\u00e6rum, Denmark) 4153 artificial ear, a B&K 4134 \u00bd\u2033 microphone, a B&K 2669 preamplifier, and a B&K 2610 measurement amplifier. To ensure audibility, individual linear amplification according to the \u201cNational Acoustic Laboratories-Revised\u201d (NAL-R) prescription formula ( ) was applied using the Master Hearing Aid research platform ( ). For all measurements, stationary speech-shaped noise at a nominal sound pressure level (SPL) of 65 dB was used. The level of the speech signal was individually set in accordance with speech reception threshold (SRT) measurements corresponding to 80%-correct performance (SRT80; see below). \n\n\n### Working Memory Capacity Measurements \n  \nTo characterize the participants in terms of their cognitive function, we administered the German reading span test implementation of   to them. The reading span test is a measure of visual working memory capacity that is rather widely used in cognitive hearing research (e.g.,  ;  ) and that includes three sub-tasks. First, the participant has to read aloud sentence segments displayed successively on a screen and to answer \u201cyes\u201d if the three previous segments made up a meaningful sentence (e.g., \u201cDas M\u00e4dchen\u2013sang\u2013ein Lied\u201d; \u201cThe girl\u2013sang\u2013a song\u201d) or \u201cno\u201d if they did not make up a meaningful sentence (e.g., \u201cDie Flasche\u2013trank\u2013Wasser\u201d; \u201cThe bottle\u2013drank\u2013water\u201d). After a block of three to six sentences, the participant has to repeat as many of the first or final words of the last block of sentences as possible in any order. Altogether, there were three training and 54 test sentences. As the performance measure, we used the percentage of correctly recalled target words across the 54 test sentences. \n\n\n### Sentence-in-Noise (SiN) Stimuli \n  \nFor the acoustic stimuli, we used the \u201cOldenburg corpus of Linguistically and Audiologically Controlled Sentences\u201d (OLACS;  ) as speech material. The OLACS consists of seven grammatically correct sentence structures that vary in linguistic complexity. For our measurements, we used two sentence structures: (1) subject-verb-object sentences with a canonical word order and therefore \u2018low\u2019 linguistic complexity, and (2) object-verb-subject sentences with a non-canonical word order and therefore \u2018high\u2019 linguistic complexity (see  ). In each sentence, there are two characters (e.g., a dragon and a panda), one of which (the subject) performs a given action with the other (the object). In the German language, the linguistic complexity of these sentences is determined by relatively subtle grammatical or acoustic cues, e.g., \u201cDe   r    m\u00fcd   e    Drach   e    fesselt de   n    gro\u00dfe   n    Panda\u201d (meaning: \u201cThe tired dragon ties up the big panda\u201d; low complexity) vs. \u201cDe   n    m\u00fcde   n    Drach   en    fesselt de   r    gro\u00df   e    Panda\u201d (meaning: \u201cThe big panda ties up the tired dragon\u201d; high complexity). For the masker signal, we used stationary speech-shaped noise. The noise started 200 ms before and ended 200 ms after the speech signal. \n  \nExample sentences from the \u201cOldenburg corpus of Linguistically and Audiologically Controlled Sentences\u201d ( ) with two levels of linguistic complexity (low, high). \n    \n\n### Visual Stimuli \n  \nAs visual stimuli, we used the picture sets developed by   that complement the sentences of the OLACS material. Each picture set consists of two similar pictures that are displayed next to each other and that are presented together with the corresponding acoustic sentence. One of the pictures (the target picture) correctly depicts the meaning conveyed by a given sentence. The other picture (the competitor picture) depicts the same situation but with interchanged roles of the subject and object. For each sentence, there are two picture sets. In one picture set, the left picture is the target; in the other picture set, the right picture is the target. \n\n\n### Speech Recognition Measurements \n  \nPrior to the eye-tracking and fMRI measurements, we assessed baseline speech recognition performance using the OLACS sentences. The task of the participants was to repeat the words they had understood, which an experimenter then scored. Initially, a training measurement based on 20 low-complexity and 20 high-complexity sentences was performed to familiarize the participants with the sentences and the procedure. Using 20 additional sentences per sentence type, we then estimated the SNR corresponding to the SRT80 for the sentences with low or high linguistic complexity. \n\n\n### Eye-Tracking Measurements \n  \n#### Response and Processing Times \n  \nDuring the eye-tracking measurements, the acoustic and visual stimuli were presented as illustrated in  . Initially, the visual stimulus was presented on its own for 1 s (stimulus segment 1) and then the acoustic SiN stimulus was added (stimulus segments 2\u20135). The participants had to identify the target picture by pressing one of three buttons on the keyboard as quickly as possible after the presentation of the acoustic stimulus (stimulus segment 6): a left button if the target picture appeared to be on the left-hand side, a right button if the target picture appeared to be on the right-hand side, or another button if neither picture appeared to match the spoken sentence. On each trial, the time taken to press the button relative to the end of the spoken sentence was recorded (the \u2018response time\u2019). To estimate the processing time, we followed the procedure of  . That is, we determined the eye fixations toward three regions of interest on the computer monitor: (1) the target picture, (2) the competitor picture, and (3) other regions. Based on the recorded eye-fixation data, we first determined the so-called single target detection amplitude (sTDA) for each participant across all sentences of a given level of linguistic complexity. The sTDA is a quantitative, normalized measure across time of the eye-fixation rate of a participant toward the target picture in relation to the eye-fixation rate toward the competitor picture or other regions.   shows an example sTDA as a function of time for a sentence with low linguistic complexity. If at a given point in time the target picture was fixated more than the competitor picture (or any other region on the screen), the sTDA is positive. If the competitor picture was fixated more, the sTDA is negative. Since the sentence recordings differed in terms of their durations, the eye fixations were time-aligned by segmenting them in a consistent fashion ( ). The processing time was estimated on the basis of the \u2018point of target disambiguation\u2019 and the \u2018decision moment.\u2019 The point of target disambiguation corresponds to the onset of the first word that allows for disambiguation to occur, i.e., the moment at which the target picture can in principle be identified. For the sentences used here, the point of target disambiguation always corresponded to the start of stimulus segment 3. The decision moment was defined as a relative criterion threshold corresponding to the 42%-point of the sTDA maximum of each test condition (for details see  ;  ). The processing times were then estimated by taking the difference (in milliseconds) between the points of target disambiguation and decision moments. Using this approach, we estimated the processing time for each participant and level of linguistic complexity. \n  \nIllustration of the processing time and response time measurements. Shown is the hypothetical eye-fixation rate (sTDA, black line) for an example sentence (\u201cDer m\u00fcde Drache fesselt den gro\u00dfen Panda\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe tired dragon ties up the big panda\u201d) with the corresponding picture set (top: target; bottom: distractor) over the course of the acoustic and visual stimulus presentation (segments 1\u20136). The shaded area illustrates 95% confidence intervals. The gray dot denotes the point of target disambiguation (PTD), which defines the onset of the first word that allows matching the acoustic sentence to the target picture (upper picture). The gray   +   symbol denotes the decision moment (DM), where the eye-fixation rate exceeds the criterion threshold (42%-point of the sTDA maximum, dashed line). The horizontal gray bar corresponds to the processing time, i.e., the time difference between PTD and DM. The black   \u00d7   symbol denotes the time point of the button press and the black bar corresponds to the response time. \n  \n\n#### Test Blocks \n  \nThe eye-tracking data were recorded in four blocks. Each block included 37 trials. Specifically, there were 30 trials with 15 low-complexity and 15 high-complexity sentences plus seven catch trials. The catch trials were included to force the participants to look at both pictures and to prevent them from developing other task-solving strategies. We used two types of catch trials. For the first type, we presented either the target or the competitor picture on both sides of the screen. Hence, either both or neither picture matched the spoken sentence. For the second type, we included two additional OLACS sentence types with different grammatical structures (and thus levels of linguistic complexity): subject-relative clauses (e.g., \u201cDer Lehrer, der die Models bestiehlt, zittert\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe teacher who is stealing from the models is shivering\u201d) and object-relative clauses (e.g., \u201cDer Maler, den die Vampire beschatten, g\u00e4hnt\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe painter whom the vampires are shadowing is yawning\u201d). These types of sentences were meant to prevent the participants from getting accustomed to specific sentence structures, thereby forcing them to attend to them continuously. The order of the test blocks was randomized across participants. One test block took about 7 min to complete. In total, each participant carried out 148 test trials (37 trials \u00d7 4 test blocks). \n\n\n#### Statistical Analysis \n  \nInitially, we assessed the ability of our participants to identify the target picture by determining the   picture   recognition rate for each level of linguistic complexity. Although the picture recognition rate cannot be directly compared with the SRT80, one would expect picture recognition rates of around 80% and more due to the availability of both acoustic and visual information. On average, the eHA and iHA groups achieved 91.0%-correct (range: 76\u201398%-correct;   SD  : 0.07%-correct) and 89.5%-correct (range: 72\u201398%-correct;   SD  : 0.08%-correct) picture recognition rates. \n\nSince the response times were logarithmically distributed, we applied a logarithmic transformation to them. We then used Kolmogorov and Levene\u2019s tests to check the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance for our datasets. The transformed response times fulfilled these assumptions (all   p   > 0.05). The same was true for the (non-transformed) processing times (all   p   > 0.05). Thus, we used parametric statistics for analyzing the log response times and processing times further. \n\n\n\n### fMRI Measurements \n  \n#### Paradigm and Conditions \n  \nFor the fMRI measurements, we used a sparse temporal sampling strategy to reduce the influence of the acoustic scanner noise ( ;  ) and also modified the eye-tracking paradigm ( ). Similar to the eye-tracking measurements, the visual stimulus was first presented on its own. After 1 s the acoustic stimulus was added. The participants had to identify the target picture by pressing one of two buttons (left or right) on a response pad with their index or middle finger after the presentation of the acoustic stimulus. After 5 s relative to the acoustic stimulus onset, the brain volume was measured, resulting in audible scanner noise for 2 s. Before and after the visual stimulus, a small cross was presented at the center of the screen, which the participants were asked to fixate. We used the same SiN stimuli with the two levels of linguistic complexity (SiN , SiN ) together with the corresponding picture sets as used for the eye-tracking measurements. In addition, we included a noise-only condition (i.e., stationary speech-shaped noise) as a reference condition to allow for the detection of speech-specific brain activation in the other conditions. In the noise-only condition, we only displayed one picture of a given picture set during the stimulus presentation. The location of the picture on the screen (left or right) was randomized, and the task of the participant was to identify the location of the picture by pressing the corresponding button on the button pad. \n  \nIllustration of the time course of a trial in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. Shown is the hypothetical BOLD response (thick dark gray line) to an example sentence (\u201cDer m\u00fcde Drache fesselt den gro\u00dfen Panda\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe tired dragon ties up the big panda\u201d) with the corresponding picture set over the course of the combined acoustic and visual stimulus presentation. A fixation cross (+) is presented on the screen before and after the stimulus presentation. The gray area denotes the scanner recording. \n  \nFor each participant, we recorded functional fMRI data in one block of 150 trials. Specifically, there were 50 trials per condition (SiN , SiN , noise only). The trials for the three stimulus conditions were presented in randomized order. After completion of the 150 trials, structural images were acquired that served as anatomical references. The fMRI measurements took about 28 min to complete. They were performed at least 3 months after the eye-tracking-measurements, so the participants could not remember the stimuli from the earlier test sessions ( ). \n\n\n#### Data Acquisition \n  \nFunctional images were obtained using T -weighted gradient echo planar imaging. Each volume consisted of 34 transversal slices recorded in ascending interleaved order [voxel size 2.2 mm \u00d7 2.2 mm\u00d7 3 mm, distance factor 20%, repetition time (TR) = 9 s, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle (FA) = 90\u00b0, field of view (FoV) = 204 mm \u00d7 204 mm \u00d7 122 mm, volume acquisition time = 2 s]. High-resolution structural images were acquired using a T -weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence (voxel size 0.7 mm \u00d7 0.7 mm \u00d7 0.9 mm, distance factor 50%, TR = 2 s, TE = 2.41 ms, FA = 9\u00b0, FoV = 230 mm \u00d7 194 mm \u00d7 187 mm). \n\n\n#### Preprocessing and General Linear Model \n  \nWe preprocessed and analyzed the imaging data using SPM 8 (FIL, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London, London, United Kingdom ) and MATLAB, r2011b (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, United States). Functional images were realigned to the first image, co-registered to each participant\u2019s structural image, normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using transformations based on information from structural tissue segmentation (tissue probability maps derived from the structural images), and smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 10 mm full-width at half maximum ( ). \n\nFor each participant, a general linear model was estimated, modeling the signal across time in every voxel of the brain. Each model contained one regressor per stimulus condition. For the SiN  and SiN  conditions, only trials with correct responses were included. All trials corresponding to incorrect responses were modeled as a separate regressor. The six head movement parameters (rigid body translations and rotations) as well as the mean CSF signal  were added as nuisance regressors. Lastly, trials with exceptionally large (and putatively artifactual) changes in the global signal were \u2018scrubbed\u2019 by including one additional regressor for each respective spike . Stimulus events were modeled with boxcar functions. A high-pass filter with a cut-off of 1/128 Hz was applied before parameter estimation to remove slow signal drifts, and residual serial correlations in the fMRI time series were accounted for by means of a first-order autoregressive model. \n\n\n#### BOLD Contrasts \n  \nTo validate our experimental approach, we investigated the main effects of stimulus type and linguistic complexity on neural activation across subjects by means of statistical parametric maps of second-level random-effects models. At the first level, we generated two sets of contrast images per participant. With the first set, general speech-induced responses were assessed by contrasting all SiN trials (i.e., SiN  and SiN ) against all noise trials (SiN > noise). With the second set, we assessed the main effect of linguistic complexity by contrasting the SiN  and SiN  trials (SiN  > SiN ). We then entered all resulting first-level contrast images into separate one-sample   t  -tests across all subjects at the second-level. For the purpose of descriptive anatomical localization, we overlaid statistical parametric maps onto the group mean structural image. \n\nTo assess the influence of participant group (iHA, eHA) on brain activation related to speech presence and linguistic complexity, we performed two-sample   t  -tests at the second-level. More specifically, we compared the mean activation levels for the SiN > noise contrast as well as the SiN  > SiN  contrast between both groups using one-tailed test statistics (e.g., iHA > eHA for SiN > noise). \n\nWe thresholded the resulting whole group   t  -statistic map for the contrast SiN > noise at a significance level of   p   < 0.05, corrected for the family-wise error (FWE) rate. For all other activation maps, this threshold criterion proved too stringent to reveal differences in brain activation patterns. Hence, we used an uncorrected significance level of   p   < 0.001 to explore possible effects of linguistic complexity and HA experience. Additionally, we applied a cluster-extent threshold of 10 voxels to all activation maps. This comparatively lenient approach of thresholding comes along with a higher risk of false positives. On the other hand, it reduces the risk of missing out on real (and potentially important) effects, as for example argued by  . \n\nStructures corresponding to peaks of significant clusters were determined by means of the Wake Forest University (WFU) Pick atlas  ( ,  ), using the Talairach Daemon (TD), AAL ( ), and ICBM labels databases. \n\n\n\n### Test Protocol \n  \nAll participants attended three visits. At the first visit, the SRT80 measurements were carried out. In addition, event-related potential measurements were performed for another study (not shown here). At the second visit, the eye-tracking and working memory capacity measurements were carried out, while at the third visit the fMRI measurements took place. The first and second visit took 2 h each, while the third visit took 1 h. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Working Memory Capacity \n  \nThe results of the reading span test are summarized in  . On average, the eHA and iHA groups could recall 43.0% (  SD  : 12%) and 38.9% (  SD  : 14%) of all target words, respectively. These results are in good agreement with other comparable studies (e.g.,  ;  ;  ). An independent   t  -test revealed no significant difference in terms of reading span between the two groups (  t   = 0.9,   p   > 0.05). \n\n\n### Speech Recognition Measurements \n  \nThe results of the SRT80 measurements are also summarized in  . On average, the two groups of participants achieved very similar SRT80s, for both low-complexity (means: -1.9 vs. -2.1 dB SNR;   SD  : 0.8 vs. 1.0 dB SNR) and high-complexity (means: -1.2 vs. -1.3 dB SNR;   SD  : 1.1 vs. 0.7 dB SNR) sentences. Two independent   t  -tests showed no group differences for the two sentence types (both   t   < 0.2, both   p   > 0.05). \n\n\n### Eye-Tracking Measurements \n  \n#### Response Times \n  \nOn average, the eHA and iHA groups had response times of 1435 and 1749 ms (  SD  : 405 and 824 ms), respectively. To analyze these data further, we performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the log-transformed data with participant group (eHA, iHA) as between-subject factor and linguistic complexity (low, high) as within-subject factor. We found no significant effects (all   p   > 0.05).   shows mean response times and SD for the two groups and levels of linguistic complexity. \n  \nMeans (and standard deviations) of the response times and processing times for the two levels of linguistic complexity (low, high) and participant groups (eHA, iHA). \n  \n\n#### Processing Times \n  \nOn average, the eHA and iHA groups had processing times of 969 ms and 1475 ms (  SD  : 389 and 590 ms), respectively. Furthermore, both groups had longer (poorer) processing times for the high-complexity sentences (means: 1105 and 1785 ms;   SD  : 478 and 532 ms) than for the low-complexity sentences (means: 833 and 1165 ms;   SD  : 215 and 483 ms). To analyze these data further, we performed an ANOVA with participant group as between-subject factor and linguistic complexity (low, high) as within-subject factor. We found significant effects of participant group (  F   = 5.5,   p   < 0.026,   = 0.18) and linguistic complexity (  F   = 21.0,   p   < 0.0001,   = 0.46), but no interaction (  p   > 0.05).   shows mean processing times and SD for the two groups and levels of linguistic complexity. \n\n\n\n### fMRI Measurements \n  \nConcerning the effect of stimulus type, we observed that the SiN stimuli led to more activation along bilateral superior temporal gyri (including primary auditory cortices), bilateral occipital gyri (including left superior occipital gyrus, bilateral middle occipital gyrus) and frontal lobe (including left superior frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and left precentral gyrus) when compared to the noise-only stimuli (  T   = 6.02   p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected, extended threshold   n   = 10).   and   show brain regions with increased activation for the SiN > noise contrast. \n  \nSpeech-specific fMRI activation maps.

(red) and   show brain regions with increased activation for the eHA > iHA (SiN  > SiN ) contrast. \n\n\n### Influence of HA Use Duration \n  \nIt is conceivable that the effects of HA experience observed above increase with longer HA use duration. To explore this possibility, we entered HA use duration (in years) as a covariate or regressor in the analyses of the data from the eHA group. For the processing times, we found no significant influence of HA use duration. For the fMRI data, we entered the first-level contrast images for (1) the SiN > noise contrast and (2) the SiN  > SiN  contrast into separate linear regression analyses at the second-level, with HA use duration as a regressor. Applying a criterion threshold of   p   < 0.001 and a minimum cluster extent of five voxels, we found no effects of HA use duration for the SiN > noise contrast. For the SiN  > SiN  contrast, however, longer HA use duration was associated with increased activation in the medial occipital part of the lingual gyri as well as in the precuneus (i.e., the medial part of Brodmann area 7). The latter structure also showed more brain activation for sentences with high as opposed to low linguistic complexity (both groups) (see section \u201cResults-fMRI Measurements\u201d). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe purpose of the current study was to explore the influence of HA experience on sentence comprehension in noise and its underlying neural processes. Using the eye-tracking paradigm of  , we measured processing times (i.e., the time taken to grasp the meaning of sentences presented against noise together with two pictures that either correctly or incorrectly depict the meaning of the sentences) based on eye-gaze measurements as well as behavioral response times (i.e., the time taken to identify the target picture via a button press after the spoken sentence). Additionally, we adapted this paradigm for fMRI measurements to obtain measures of brain activation, as inferred from BOLD contrasts. Our participants were groups of experienced and inexperienced HA users matched in terms of age, hearing loss, and working memory capacity. Consistent with previous findings, processing times increased with greater linguistic complexity and were also longer (poorer) for the iHA group than for the eHA group, despite comparable speech recognition performance. Also consistent with previous findings, the behavioral response times were not sensitive to these effects. Furthermore, we found some indications of stronger speech-specific activation in primarily frontal regions (i.e., insuperior frontal gyrus, right precentral frontal gyrus, and right middle frontal gyrus) of the iHA group. The observed group differences in brain activation were generally subtle and not entirely consistent with the research literature. Below, we discuss these findings in more detail. \n\n### Effects of HA Experience and Linguistic Complexity on Processing Times \n  \nThe effects of participant group and linguistic complexity on the processing times that we observed were consistent with the results of   and  ,  . In each of these studies, HA experience was related to shorter processing times and higher linguistic complexity to longer processing times. In view of the consistency of these findings, we conclude that untreated hearing loss leads to poorer SiN processing as measured via processing times and that HA experience can ameliorate these effects, at least if well-fitted HAs are used consistently for several months (see  ). In this context, it is worth noting that the response times do not appear sensitive to these effects. As argued in  , this is likely a consequence of the \u2018offline\u2019 nature of this task. Offline tasks require the participant to respond   after   the stimulus presentation, for example by repeating words as in standard speech audiometry measurements. Thus, they cannot reveal when precisely speech comprehension occurred. \u2018Online\u2019 paradigms such as processing times, on the other hand, make it possible to investigate the influence of factors such as HA experience   during   the comprehension process. Presumably, they can therefore provide more detailed information about higher-level cognitive functions, including those affected by experience with amplified sound. \n\n\n### Effects of Speech Processing on Cortical Activation Patterns \n  \nOur observation of an increased activation in a large-scale frontotemporal network (including bilateral superior temporal gyrus, precentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus) for SiN relative to noise-only stimuli is largely in line with other literature findings. Previous studies found stronger activation for SiN compared to noise-only stimuli in frontotemporal areas including bilateral temporal cortex (superior temporal sulcus, middle temporal gyrus), left inferior frontal gyrus and left precentral gyrus (e.g.,  ;  ). These activated areas are believed to reflect the processing required to extract the meaning of speech and thus to achieve comprehension ( ;  ). The similarity between our results and those of previous studies lends support to the general validity of our experimental approach. \n\nThere were also signs of increased activation for high-complexity compared to low-complexity sentences. The additional activation was most evident in frontal areas (including bilateral middle frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, and left superior frontal gyrus) and temporal areas (including left middle temporal gyrus). In previous studies, these areas also showed more activation for complex compared to simple sentence structures (e.g.,  ,  ;  ). The study that can be compared most directly with ours is the one of  , in which stimuli with very similar (German) sentence structures were used. For a group of young normal-hearing participants,   observed more activation in left inferior frontal gyrus for more complex compared to simpler sentences. \n\nWe also found more activation in left precuneus for high-complexity compared to low-complexity sentences. This finding seems to be in accordance with the results of   who presented auditory or audio-visual narratives to young normal-hearing listeners. Based on correlation analyses, these authors identified an extended network of brain regions involved in the processing of the narratives, which included the precuneus. Together, these results support the idea that the precuneus is involved in the comprehension of higher-level linguistic stimuli. \n\nLastly, we observed significantly more activation in occipital areas (including superior occipital gyrus and middle occipital gyrus) for SiN relative to noise-only stimuli and for high-complexity relative to low-complexity sentences. The occipital lobe is the visual processing center of the brain (e.g.,  ). To achieve sentence comprehension for SiN and high-complexity sentences, the participants probably looked more back and forth between the picture sets compared to noise-only and low-complexity sentences. To investigate brain activation due to eye movements,   presented a group of healthy participants with static or moving visual stimuli in an fMRI experiment. For the moving stimuli, they found more activation in the temporo-parieto-occipital junction, which they traced back to greater eye movements of the participants. Broadly speaking, this is in accordance with our finding of increased activation in occipital areas. \n\n\n### Effects of HA Experience on Cortical Activation Patterns \n  \nRelative to the eHA group, the iHA group showed signs of more activation for the SiN > noise contrast in right frontal areas (including superior frontal gyrus, precentral frontal gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus). This suggests that HA acclimatization reduces the recruitment of frontal brain regions. Broadly speaking, this is in accordance with   who observed that listeners with poorer hearing recruit additional frontal areas to compensate for speech processing deficits. However, we found no indications of more brain activation in temporal areas of the inexperienced users, as suggested by  . \n\nAdditionally, the iHA group showed signs of stronger activation related to higher linguistic complexity in the cerebellum. To our knowledge, the cerebellum has not been discussed yet in the context of hearing impairment. Nevertheless, previous studies have suggested that it may be involved in auditory and linguistic functions (e.g.,  ;  ). In principle, the cerebellum could therefore also undergo brain changes as a result of untreated hearing loss. Further research would be required to investigate this issue. \n\nIn contrast to the iHA group, the eHA group showed signs of more sentence-specific activation in medial orbitofrontal cortex. To our knowledge, the orbitofrontal cortex has not been discussed in the context of hearing impairment yet either.   showed that the orbitofrontal cortex is critically involved when a participant has to make a decision. The increased brain activation that we observed for the eHA group could, in principle, be a reflection of their better ability to identify the target picture, as apparent from their faster processing time measurements. Further research would also be required to investigate this issue. \n\nAt a more general level, it is worth speculating about the origin of the observed group differences in speech processing. The differences in acoustic stimulation that the two groups of participants were accustomed to from their daily lives probably manifested themselves in across-group differences in neural (re)organization. As a consequence, even if both groups followed the same hearing-related strategy when performing the different speech-in-noise tasks, the eHA group likely had an advantage because their auditory systems were adjusted for aided listening. It could also be that the two groups adopted different strategies, for example (not) focusing on (unfamiliar sounding) spectro-temporal cues that are only/more salient during aided listening. Our study cannot reveal which, if any or both, of these possibilities can explain the group differences that we found. We hypothesize that the effects of HA experience primarily manifest themselves at late (cortical) levels. Such a hypothesis would be consistent with the fact that the human brain is most malleable (and thus shaped by sensory experiences) in cortex. Further research needs to be devoted to this issue. In terms of potential implications for hearing rehabilitation, our study provides evidence for the importance of consistent HA use in relation to speech comprehension in noise, possibly related to less recruitment of brain regions outside the core sentence-comprehension network. \n\nLastly, it is important to point out that the group differences discussed above were subtle and based on a comparatively lenient thresholding criterion (see section \u201cMaterials and Methods-fMRI Measurements\u201d). Because of the inherent complexity and inter-individual variability of cortical processes, differences in fMRI activation pertaining to group contrasts such as the ones tested here are, in general, likely to be small. To substantiate the initial findings from the current study, follow-up studies with larger sample sizes are needed for identifying and corroborating changes in cortical speech processing with HA use. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn the current study, we used a cross-sectional design to explore the influence of HA experience on cognitive processes related to sentence comprehension in noise. To that end, we measured sentence processing times using an eye-tracking paradigm. Additionally, we performed fMRI measurements to explore brain activation patterns in response to SiN or noise-only stimuli. We found that inexperienced HA users had significantly longer processing times than participants with at least 1 year of bilateral HA experience. This is consistent with the findings of three earlier studies and implies poorer SiN processing due to untreated hearing loss, even when adequate speech audibility is ensured. Regarding the fMRI measurements, we found indications of stronger activation in several brain areas (especially in left frontal regions) for high-complexity compared to low-complexity sentences, consistent with the literature. Furthermore, the inexperienced HA users showed signs of more activation for SiN relative to noise-only stimuli in right frontal areas (including superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus) compared to the experienced users. Because the observed group differences in brain activation were subtle, follow-up research is needed to investigate putative changes in cortical recruitment as a result of HA use in more detail. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nEthical approval for all experimental procedures was obtained from the ethical review board of the University of Oldenburg.

Although a human homologue of such a circuit has been identified whether activity within this circuit varies depending on handedness has yet to be investigated. \n\n\n## Methodology/Principal Findings \n  \nWe used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explicitly test how handedness modulates activity within human grasping-related brain areas. Right- and left-handers subjects were requested to reach towards and grasp an object with either the right or the left hand using a precision grip while scanned. A kinematic study was conducted with similar procedures as a behavioral counterpart for the fMRI experiment. Results from a factorial design revealed significant activity within the right dPMC, the right cerebellum and AIP bilaterally. The pattern of activity within these areas mirrored the results found for the behavioral study. \n\n\n## Conclusion/Significance \n  \nData are discussed in terms of an handedness-independent role for the right dPMC in monitoring hand shaping, the need for bilateral AIP activity for the performance of precision grip movements which varies depending on handedness and the involvement of the cerebellum in terms of its connections with AIP. These results provide the first compelling evidence of specific grasping related neural activity depending on handedness. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe highly developed ability of the hand to grasp and manipulate objects under precise visual control is one of the key features of the human motor system. In recent years, there have been significant advances in our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the motor commands that allow the hand to be shaped for efficient grasp of the object. An important step forward comes from studies in which single neurons were recorded during reach-to-grasp actions  . These studies showed that in macaques grasp-related sensorimotor transformations are accomplished in a circuit constituted by the anterior-most region within the lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (area AIP), the ventral premotor area F5 and the dorsal premotor area F2  . It is postulated that AIP may furnish area F5 with visual signals of objects to aid in the selection of grasp configurations that are appropriate for their intrinsic attributes (e.g., size). Then F5 provides grasp-related information to the dorsal premotor area F2. Area F2 contains neurons with similar properties as those found in F5 in terms of types of grasp discrimination during movement execution and it has the role to monitor hand configuration while the to-be-grasped object is approached  \u2013 . \n\nMany neuroimaging studies have explored in humans the existence of a cortical grasping circuit similar to that described in monkeys revealing activation within the putative homolog of macaque areas AIP, F5 and F2 for reviews see  ,  . All these neuroimaging studies, however, have so far been focused on reach-to-grasp movements of the right hand in right-handers participants. An issue, which has yet to be addressed is concerned with how the neural circuit underlying grasping modulates with respect to handedness, a basic feature of the human motor behavior. To date, the only available evidence comes from an unpublished report in which seven right-handed subjects performed grasping to visual targets with either the right or the left hand while scanned  . The main result was that grasping with either hand led to bilateral AIP activation, though both the extent and the magnitude of activation were much larger in the hemisphere contralateral to the hand used. \n\nAlthough this preliminary study provides some hints regarding the lateralization of grasping related activity in right-handed humans, there is a call for a full investigation which considers possible differences across hands in both right- and left handed subjects. Such comparison becomes particularly relevant when considering recent behavioural evidence comparing the performance of right- and left-handers in a precision grip task. The results show that whereas right-handers exhibited a strong preference to use their dominant right hand to grasp the objects, left-handers did not show this preference and instead used their right hand 50% of the time  ,  . These results suggest that the hand used for precision grasping does not follow the usual pattern of asymmetries in hand use that defines left and right handedness. \n\nTo our knowledge, there are no published studies that have investigated whether brain activation for grasping tasks is always contralateral to the hand, modulated by handedness and the used hand., or always located in the same hemisphere regardless of handedness. Therefore, here we studied the kinematics and fMRI activation patterns of right- and left-handers humans during the performance of a precision grip movement (PG) executed with either the right or the left hand (RH, LH, respectively). \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Functional MRI \n  \nBlood Oxygenated Level Dependent (BOLD) signal was measured during the execution of PG movements performed with either the right or the left hand, by right-or left-handed participants. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) with handedness (right-handers, left-handers) as a between-subjects factor and performing hand (RH, LH) as a within-subjects factor was performed. Data were analyzed by applying a voxelwise analysis within a brain mask including regions selectively involved in visually guided precision grasping in humans  ,  . Specifically, these areas were the primary motor cortex (M1), the dorsal and ventral regions of the premotor cortex (vPMC and dPMC, respectively), the anterior part of the intraparietal sulcus (AIP) and the cerebellum  ,  . \n\n#### Main effect of handedness \n  \nWhen contrasting activity related to handedness independently from the used hand (right-handers/RH+right-handers/LH)>(left-handers/RH+left-handers/LH) significant differential activity was found within the primary motor cortex bilaterally (see  ). The opposite contrast (left-handers/RH+left-handers/LH)>(right-handers/RH+right-handers/LH) did not bring to any significant effect. \n   Brain regions showing significant effects for the ANOVA handedness by performing hand.        \n\n#### Main effect of performing hand \n  \nThe contrast testing for differences between RH and LH independently from handedness (right-handers/RH+left-handers/RH)>(right-handers/LH+left-handers/LH) revealed significant activity within both the anterior and posterior sectors of the left primary motor cortex (see  ). The opposite contrast (right-handers/LH+left-handers/LH)>(Right-handers/RH+Left-handers/RH) revealed significant differential activity within the right primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices (see  ). \n\n\n#### Interaction handedness by performing hand \n  \nThe interaction between handedness and performing hand (right-handers/RH\u2212right-handers/LH)\u2212(left-handers/RH\u2212left-handers/LH) revealed significant differential activity within the right hemisphere for the dPMC and the cerebellum (6  lobule). Furthermore, significant activity was observed bilaterally within the AIP. For the dPMC, post-hoc contrasts revealed that activity within this area was greater for left- than right-handers when the left hand was used to perform the task (  and  ). Such difference was not evident when the right hand was used. Further, whereas left-handers showed a significant increase in activation for the left in respect to the right hand, right-handers showed a similar level of activity for the two hands. When exploring the significant variations of brain activity detected within the AIP bilaterally (  and  ), AIP was significantly more activated in right-handers in respect to left-handers when the performing hand was the right. In addition, in right-handers the use of the right dominant hand led to stronger activity in respect to the left hand within AIP in both hemispheres. No differences were found concerning left-handers and between right- and left-handers when using the left hand. A similar pattern of activation was found for the 6  lobule of the right cerebellar hemisphere (  and  ). The   t  -contrast (right-handers/LH\u2212right-handers/RH)\u2212(left-handers/RH\u2212left-handers/LH) did not bring to any significant effect. \n   Functional MRI results.  \nGroup statistical map resulting from the interaction between handedness and performing hand. The contrast (Right-handers/RH\u2212Right-handers/LH)\u2212(Left-handers/RH\u2212Left-handers/LH) revealed significant effects on brain activity within the dPMC (A), the left (B) and the right (C) AIP, and the right cerebellum (D), corresponding to the 6  lobule. Only activations detected with the Small Volume Correction applied to the random effects analysis are considered (FWE corrected, p<0.05 within the mask). Side panels report the beta values observed for the indicated area. Anatomical specifications are defined on the basis of cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps (Eickoff et al, 2007). Activation maps are superimposed on the ch2 template provided with the software package MriCRO. Images are displayed in neurological convention. MNI coordinates for the significant areas are reported in  . \n  \n\n\n### Behavioural Experiment \n  \nFor each subject the average value for each kinematical measure across trials was entered into an ANOVA similar to that performed for the fMRI data.The analyses were performed on the dependent variables considered as \u2018classic\u2019 markers of reach-to-grasp kinematics: (i) movement duration; (ii) the amplitude of maximum arm peak velocity; (iii) the time of maximum arm peak velocity; (iv) the time of maximum grip aperture (i.e., the maximum distance between the thumb and index finger); (v) the time from maximum grip aperture to the end of the movement (closing time) and (vi) the amplitude of maximum peak grip aperture. Given the rather mixed results obtained by the paucity of studies comparing reach-to-grasp kinematics of the right and left hand in right-handers and the lack of previous evidence concerned with similar behaviors in left-handers, it is rather difficult to make specific prediction on how the considered variables will behave. If the right and the left hand will follow the same kinematic structure, as some studies on right-handers have demonstrated  \u2013 , then we may not expect differences related to handedness for the considered kinematic variables. Alternatively, if the results that right-handers reach out to grasp stimuli with an unusual hand posture when using the left rather than the right hand is confirmed  ,   then we expect a reverse pattern in left-handers. For instance we could expect that right-handers would manifest a less dexterous performance with the left hand and when the less dexterous hand is used a wider safety margin would be put in place. Such effect should be evident in a larger and anticipated maximum grip aperture, a faster initial hand opening and increased time from the time of maximum grip aperture to the end of grasp and an overall increase in movement duration. Further, if the suggestion that left-handers are more likely to use the right than the left hand to perform precision grasp movements  ,  , therefore violating handedness, then we may expect the left hand to behave less dexterously than the right hand for this subjects' group. \n\nThe main factor \u2018performing hand\u2019 was significant for the time at which the hand reached its maximum aperture [F(1,9)\u200a=\u200a39.41, p<0.0001; \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.87] and for closing time [F(1,9)\u200a=\u200a32.05; p<0.0001; \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.81], the time from the maximum grip aperture to object contact. For both right- and left-handers the time to maximum grip aperture was anticipated ( ) and closing time was longer ( ) when the task was performed with the left than with the right hand. The interaction between handedness and performing hand was significant for movement duration [F(1,9)\u200a=\u200a16.13, p<0.0001; \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.77] and the amplitude of peak velocity [F(1,9)\u200a=\u200a16.22; p<0.001; \u03b7 \u200a=\u200a0.67]. Post-hoc contrasts revealed that when left-handers used the left hand movement duration was longer ( ) and the amplitude of peak velocity was lower ( ) than when the right hand was used (p <0.05). For right-handers movement duration ( ) and the amplitude of peak velocity ( ) were similar for both hands (p >0.05). Though there was a strong tendency indicating that for this group movement duration was shorter and the amplitude of peak velocity faster for movements performed with the right hand (p\u200a=\u200a0.057 and p\u200a=\u200a0.06, respectively; see  ). \n   Kinematics results.  \nGraphical representation for the main factor \u2018hand\u2019 for the time of maximum grip aperture (A) and closing time (B).

Results indicate that overall both right- and left-handers accomplished the task equally well with either the right and the left hand. However, as outlined below, depending on the relationship between handedness and the hand used distinguishable neural and kinematic patterns were revealed. \n\n### Activity Related to the Right Dorsal Premotor Cortex \n  \nOn the basis of neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies the role of the dPMC for distal forelimb movements is becoming increasingly established  ,  ,  . In this respect, monkeys and human studies agree that the dPMC has the role of keeping in memory the motor representation of the to-be-grasped object and combine it with visual information as to continuously update the configuration and orientation of the hand as it approaches the object to be grasped  ,  . \n\nHere we show that it was only the dPMC within the right hemisphere which was significantly activated. A result which is in accordance with previous evidence suggesting a specific right hemisphere contribution to grip formation  ,  . Specifically, the pattern of activation shows that, whereas activity within the right dPMC was similar for both right- and left-handers when performing the task with the right hand, it differed between the two groups when the left hand was used. This was evident when looking at the significant increase in activation when left-handers used the dominant left rather than the right hand. A possible explanation for these effects might be found in recent neurophysiological and neuroimaging findings demonstrating that the dPMC is involved in the control of distal actions  ,  ,  ,  ,  . In first instance, one study provides compelling evidence that in the distal forelimb representation of area F2 there are neurons that are selective for the type of prehension required for grasping the object  . These results indicate an important role of the dPMC in the control of goal-related hand movements. Specifically, the proposal here is that the dPMC involvement during goal-directed actions might be highly correlated with the accuracy requirement of the ongoing movement  . In humans the contribution of the dPMC to hand movements, the time course of its involvement and its hemispheric dominance are essentially unknown. A recent neuroimaging investigation, however, suggests that in humans as in monkeys this area is involved in the control of grasping  . In this study the congruency between the adopted grasp and the grasp called by an object was investigated. An increase of activity within the dPMC for incongruent grasps was reported. In order to resolve the mismatch between type of grasp and object size which, occurred for the incongruent conditions, this area showed an increase of activation which was interpreted as the need for a more effective control. Assuming that, as previously demonstrated, left-handers show a significant tendency to use the right hand when performing precision grip movements  ,   such increase may signify that the dPMC was differentially activated because the dominant left-hand was less skilled as to perform the task and more control was needed. \n\nThe pattern of dPMC activity for the interaction between handedness and hand mirrors the pattern obtained for the same interaction for movement duration and the amplitude of maximum peak velocity. Remember that movement duration was longer and the amplitude of peak velocity was lower when left-handers used the left than the right hand. However, for right-handers no significant differences across hands were observed (though a slightly similar trend was noticed). Such \u2018slowness\u2019 may suggests that the dPMC is differentially activated when both right- and left-handers use the left rather than the right hand. Support for this contention comes when considering kinematics results in terms of the main effect of \u2018hand\u2019. We found a significant anticipation of maximum grip aperture and an increase in closing time for the left than for the right hand in both subjects' groups. These are two kinematic parameters indicative of the timing taken by the hand to establish adequate finger positioning before object lifting. Altogether these findings are in line with previous evidence suggesting that the dPMC may control the grasping phase before the lifting phase  . Because the lifting phase can only be initiated when finger positioning is completed and/or when the grip force has reached an adequate level, the present results concerned with the less dexterous hand are compatible with such a function of the dPMC. \n\n\n### Bilateral Activity Within the Anterior Intraparietal Sulcus \n  \nIn both humans and monkeys AIP is an important component of the parietal-premotor circuit known to be involved in the transformation of an object's intrinsic properties into specific grips  ,  . In our study, we confirm the pattern of AIP bilateral activity previously found in right-handers using either the right or the left hand  ,  \u2013 . Although this result could be due to a bidirectional crosstalk between the two homologous areas or more simply to the evidence that we can grasp objects with two hands  , recent evidence suggests that bilateral AIP activity is a pre-requisite for hand shaping formation  . By using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) it has been revealed that whereas unilateral AIP virtual lesion failed to impair hand shaping, such process was impaired when TMS was applied bilaterally to AIP  . This suggests that both AIPs might be necessary regardless of the hand in use  . Further, indirect evidence, that a bilateral AIP virtual lesion might be needed to disrupt grasping comes from two studies revealing that a unilateral AIP lesion failed to alter the hand conformation except when the object size and orientation were unexpectedly changed  ,  . There is also evidence, however, that unilateral TMS over either the right or the left AIP disrupts grasping movements for the contralateral hand  ,  . A result which is in contrast with the findings reported above suggesting that a bilateral lesion of AIP might be necessary to determine a deficit in hand shaping  . Yet, a close inspection of the experimental protocols used in these studies suggest that such discrepancies can be accounted by the different timing at which the TMS pulses were applied. Whereas in the studies suggesting the need for a bilateral AIP virtual lesion to elicit grasping disruption the TMS pulses were applied during action execution  , those studies revealing grasping disruption following unilateral TMS application delivered the pulse at the time the movement was planned  ,  . Because the fMRI results reported here are concerned with grasping execution, we are inclined to suggest that our findings provide further fuel to the proposal that a bilateral AIP involvement might be necessary for the execution of precision grip movements and might be a distinctive feature of the anterior sector of human posterior parietal cortex  ,  \u2013 ,  . \n\nNoticeably in the present study the pattern of activity found within this area is similar in both hemispheres, but differs depending on hand and handedness. In particular, an increase of bilateral AIP activity was evident for right-handers with respect to left-handers when using the right-hand. For the two subjects' groups a similar level of activity was found for the left hand. These findings may suggest the superiority of the right hand in the performance of manipulations requiring dexterous finger movements, high precision in interjoint coordination and trajectory formation in right-handers  ,  . Therefore the accuracy demanded by the task used here and the consequent need for the determination of precise contact points may allow to reveal such right hand superiority in right-handers. In this view it would be tempting to suggest that such \u2018superiority\u2019 requires more sophisticated visuomotor transformation processes which translate in an increased level of activity in AIP when right-handers used the right hand for accurate tasks. Evidence that AIP activity might be modulated by the level of task complexity comes from both inactivation study in macaques   and neuroimaging studies  ,  . In first instance, transient inactivation of AIP, by injecting a GABA-receptor agonist (muscimol) produced grasping errors only for difficult tasks that required a precision grip to grasp a small cube or a small sphere (as in the present experiment). In second instance right-handed subjects show a significant increase in grasp related AIP activity when performing a precise than when performing whole hand grasp  ,  . \n\nConversely, for left-handers a similar level of AIP activity for either hand was found. Therefore with a certain degree of caution we suggest that for left-handers the level of visuomotor trasformation occurring in AIP might be indistinguishable for the two hands. This observation, is in line with the anatomical observation of differences in interhemispheric connections in relation to handedness  . And it might also suggest differences in the functional organization of AIP in right- and left-handed people as previously demonstrated for motor and premotor areas  . \n\n\n### Right Cerebellar Activity \n  \nLesion, imaging, and electrophysiological evidence suggest a cerebellar involvement during prehension. Cerebellar patients  \u2013  exhibit a spectrum of kinematic impairments in the learning, planning, and execution of prehensile movements which are consistent with the proposal that the cerebellum plays a major role in the control and coordination of reach-to-grasp movements. Further, neurophysiological work has identified various cerebellar structures implicated in the kinematics of reach-to-grasp movements  \u2013 . Similarly, functional imaging reach-to-grasp studies reported cerebellar activations  ,  \u2013 . \n\nOf interest is that in the present study the pattern of activity found for the right cerebellum mirrors that found for AIP. This result may be explained in light of recent developments for the investigation of the anatomical connections between key grasping areas such as AIP and the cerebellum. Specifically, using retrograde transneuronal transport of viruses cerebellum inputs to AIP have been revealed  \u2013 . Therefore the similarity of the pattern of cerebellar activity with the pattern of activity found in AIP (and their possible connections) expands the potential sphere of influence of the cerebellum. This adds an additional layer of complexity to this picture by possibly demonstrating that AIP receives input from the cerebellum which is necessary for the adaptive adjustment of motor output and sensorimotor mechanisms which could have great utility for adjusting hand shape during object manipulation. The result that it seems to be chiefly the right cerebellum to be involved confirms the specificity of the right hand for the performance of precise grasping actions. \n\n\n### Kinematic Observations \n  \nPrevious studies on grasping comparing the performance for the right and the left hand are largely confined to the right-handers population  ,  . In keeping with these previous findings the present results confirm that in right-handers both the right and the left hand largely share a common level of kinematic parameterization  ,  . Further, they indicate that in right-handers movements performed with the right hand were generally faster and the left hand grasped with a wider safety margin. In this respect, the time of maximum grip aperture was anticipated and closing time was increased for the left than for the right hand. This suggests that when the left hand was used more time and on-line control was needed as to possibly compensate for a higher end-point variability. This is in accordance with previously published data in right-handers suggesting that manipulations requiring dexterous finger movements, such as precision grip, are mastered more efficiently by the right hand  ,  ,  . \n\nAlthough the results for left-handers largely mirror those obtained for right-handers, an important observation is that in left-handers the use of the left hand dictated the put in place of compensatory strategies (e.g., anticipation of the time of maximum grip aperture) which were similar to those adopted by right-handers when using the same hand. We suspect that this occurs because grasping a small object with a precision grip with the left hand might be for the left-handers group a quite unnatural act. This idea is supported by behavioral observations on both human  ,   and non-human primates  . In first instance left-handers are much more likely than right-handers to use the \u201cnon-dominant\u201d hand to pick up objects  ,  . In second instance, a series of elegant studies on hand preferences in chimpanzees has reported that chimpanzees who used a precision grip to grasp small pieces of food were more likely to use their right hand  . Therefore the preferential use of the right hand by left-handers in a precision grip task may reflect a property of the brain that is ancient and hard-wired as the studies on hand preferences in chimpanzees, our closest phylogenetic relatives, may demonstrate. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nThe present results shed new light on the functional mechanisms presiding over the control of visually guided hand grasping actions in both right- and left-handers. Specifically, the strength and the novelty of our findings come chiefly from contrasting both hands in these populations. This enabled us to define the functional properties of key areas involved in the control of grasping depending on handedness. Crucially, they extend the current human neuroimaging literature in three important and interconnected ways. First, they highlight the role played by the right dPMC in monitoring the configuration of fingers when precise prehensile movements are performed by either the right and the left hand. This role becomes particularly evident when the hand less-skilled to perform such action is utilized. Second, they provide behavioural and neuroimaging evidence that both right- and left-handers prefer the right hand when precise grasp has to be performed. Finally they offer some indirect evidence in humans of the connections between the cerebellum and AIP, an area which is fundamental for the visuomotor transformations underlying grasping. \n\n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Functional MRI \n  \n#### Subjects \n  \nNineteen right-handed (12 women and 7 men; age range: 19\u201330 years; mean age: 24,7 years) and fifteen left-handed (10 women and 5 men; age range: 21\u201335 years; mean age: 26,1 years) participated in the experiment. They all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and they had no neurologic or psychiatric history, or any motor pathology. Handedness (right-handedness, left-handedness) was assessed by using a test of manual dominance  . On the basis of the scores obtained with this test all right handed participants were classified as strongly right handed (36/36) and all left handed participants were classified as strongly left handed (36/36). Before entering the scanner room all gave informed written consent according to the Tuebingen University Hospital Ethical guidelines and with the declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n#### Stimulus \n  \nThe stimulus consisted of a spherical plastic objects of 3 cm diameter presented at a constant distance of 30 cm. We used a regular geometric shape rather than functional objects (i) for comparability with macaque neurophysiology studies  ,   and (ii) to examine grasping in a general manner, rather than introducing further aspects like tool use involving a particular network in the left-hemisphere  . Stimulus dimension was chosen in order to elicit a PG type of prehension which considers the opposition of the pulpar surface of the index finger with the thumb. We decided to confine our analysis to PG movements because it is more demanding than other type of prehensile movements in terms of accuracy and neural processing, as demonstrated in previous kinematic and neuroimaging studies  ,  . \n\n\n#### Experimental setup \n  \nStimulus was presented by means of a metal free structure, allowing for presentation of 3D stimuli in the scanner bore  ,  . The device was attached to the sides of the sliding bed and was fitting the diameter of the bore. Two sliding bars allowed for the regulation of stimulus position, in order to present it at waist-deep, easily and comfortably reachable from participants' hand while lying down in the scanner bore, without the need for upper arm or shoulder movement. To further minimize the risk of head movement, potentially induced by arm movements, upper arms were fixed with an elastic band. In order to maintain constant the hand starting position across subjects and trials subjects wore a metal-free belt upon which a pad was attached. At the start of each trial the performing hand (right or left) was maintained in a relaxed position laying with the palm upon the pad whereas the other upper arm/hand ensemble was stripped to the scanner bore. The head was tilted at an angle (\u223c30 deg) and supported with a foam wedge, that permitted direct viewing of the stimuli below the coil without mirrors. Such direct viewing avoids introducing additional transformations required by mirror-viewing  ,  ,  . In addition, participants were allowed free viewing between trials, but they were explicitly instructed to look at the object during action execution. \n\n\n#### Task procedures \n  \nThe experiment was conducted within an illuminated room. Participants were requested to perform two types of action: grasping the object with a precision grip through the opposition of thumb and index finger (G), or to simply reach it (R), touching it with the back of the hand by using a closed fist posture. The reaching action served two purposes: First, it served as control condition at first level analysis (see \u2018First-level data analysis\u2019 section). Second, it prevented the possible occurrence of fMR adaptation concerning action execution. Participants were requested to perform the movements with either the right (RH) or the left (LH) hand. Participants were instructed to unfold the action at a natural speed and were informed about the action to perform through a sound delivered by pneumatic MR-compatible headphones: (i) G - low tone (duration: 200 ms; frequency: 1,7 kHz); (ii) R - high tone (duration: 200 ms; frequency: 210 Hz.). Although the object was always visible, participants were explicitly requested to start the movements at the time the sound was presented. Therefore, the sound served both as a \u2018go\u2019 signal and as to indicate the type of action (R or G) to be performed. From the control cabin beside the scanner room it was possible to monitor the person inside the scanner through a glass. Therefore the it was possible to control whether the subjects responded to the sounds and whether they were performing the action corresponding to the presented tone. \n\n\n#### Experimental design \n  \nThe experiment was conducted by using a mixed event-related design. Handedness (right-handers, left-handers) was the between-subjects factor. Type of action (G, R) and performing hand (RH, LH) were the within-subjects factors. The type of action was alternated within runs by following a pseudo-randomized sequence. Trials of the same type (R or G) were grouped in sequences varying from four to eight elements. This was done in order to minimize brain activity due to frequent task changes  . The performing hand (LH, RH) was maintained constant within runs, and alternated between runs. Further, Inter Stimulus Interval (ISI) varied from 3 to 8 seconds following a \u2018long exponential\u2019 probability distribution   and was randomized across trials. A total of 70 trials per each condition was administered. The whole experimental session consisted of 280 trials, divided into 4 runs of 70 trials each. Runs were kept very short in order to avoid participant's fatigue. \n\n\n#### Imaging parameters \n  \nImages were acquired with a whole-body 3 T scanner (Siemens Magnetom Trio, TIM system) equipped with a standard Siemens 12 channels coil. Functional images were acquired with a gradient-echo, echo-planar (EPI) T2*-weighted sequence in order to measure blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast throughout the whole brain (47 contiguous axial slices acquired with descending interleaved sequence, 64\u00d764 voxels, 3.3\u00d73.3\u00d73 mm resolution, FOV\u200a=\u200a210\u00d7210 mm , flip angle\u200a=\u200a90\u00b0, TE\u200a=\u200a30 ms, bandwidth:1954 Hz/Px). Volumes were acquired continuously with a repetition time (TR) of 3 s; 77 volumes were collected in each single scanning run (3:51 minutes). High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired for each subject (3D MP-RAGE, 176 axial slices, data matrix 256\u00d7256, 1 mm isotropic voxels, TR\u200a=\u200a1859 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a3.14 ms, flip angle\u200a=\u200a22\u00b0). \n\n\n#### First-level data analysis \n  \nData analysis was performed using the software package SPM5 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College of London, UK -  ). The first four scans for each session were excluded from data analysis because of the non-equilibrium state of magnetization. For each participant, images underwent motion correction, and each volume was realigned to the first volume in the series. The anatomical scan was then co-registered to the mean of all functional images, previously corrected for intensity inhomogeneities through the bias correction algorithm implemented in SPM5. EPI images were then normalized (resampling: native voxel size) adopting the MNI152 template, supplied by the Montreal Neurological Institute ( ) and distributed with the software SPM. Finally images were smoothed using a 6.6\u00d76.6\u00d76 mm FWHM 3D Gaussian kernel (twice the native voxel size). High-pass filtering (128 sec) was also applied to remove low-frequency drifts in signal. After motion correction four participants (three right-handers and one left-hander) had to excluded from further analysis because of large head motion (exceeding voxel size, 3.3 mm). At the first level, for each single subject, types of action (G, R) performed with either the right or the left hand (RH, LH) were modelled as separate events type. The duration was assumed of about 2 seconds on the basis of behavioural observations before the experimental session. This was done in order to get participants acquainted with the experimental setup. Regressors were defined on the timing of presentation of each experimental condition. These functions were convolved with a canonical, synthetic HRF (haemodynamic response function) and its first-order temporal derivative to produce individual models  . The temporal derivative was considered since it allows for a temporal shift of the peak of the BOLD response. Errors (incorrect actions) were modelled as a further condition of no interest (maximum error rate: R\u200a=\u200a0.6%; G\u200a=\u200a1,2%). For each subject, all regressors were incorporated into General Linear Models [GLM \u2013 64] and motion correction parameters, created during the realignment stage, were included in the analysis as a covariate of no interest. This was done in order to model residual effects due to head motion. Individual models were separately estimated and contrasts were defined in order to pick out the main effects of each experimental condition. Then, for each participant the reaching-related activation was subtracted from the correspondent grasping-related activation (G_RH>R_RH; G_LH>R_LH). This procedure has been adopted in several previous neuroimaging studies on visuomotor control of grasping in humans  ,  ,  ,   as to isolate brain activation solely related to the hand shaping process involving the palm and the fingers while approaching and grasping the object. The subtraction was applied for each participant. \n\n\n#### Second-level data analysis \n  \nHRF contrasts resulting from the subtraction (e.g., G_RH>R_RH) performed at the first level analysis were then entered into a second level random-effect analysis (2\u00d72 ANOVA) in which performing hand (LH or RH) was manipulated as within-subjects variable (corrected for sphericity and equal variance assumed), and handedness (Right-handers, Left-handers) served as a between-subjects variable. The resulting SPM  {t}   maps reflected areas in which variance related to the experimental manipulation was captured by the HRF adopted in the GLM. \n\nAs outlined at the start of the \u2018 \u2019section, we focussed our investigation on the specific contribution of areas involved in the execution of grasping movements. To date only a preliminary imaging study has compared reach-to-grasp movements performed with the right and the left hand in right-handers   showing bilateral AIP activity. Therefore we may expect a similar result in the present study for right-handers which may extend to left-handers. With respect to premotor cortices we cannot make any firm prediction. However, considering the evidence of a specific role for the dPMC in monitoring the configuration and orientation of the hand as it approached the to-be-grasped object  ,   it may be expected that this area may show a differential activation in both right- and left-handers for the control of the non-dominant hand (i.e., left and right hand, respectively). A caveat concerned with this prediction is that if, as previously demonstrated, left-handers prefer to use the non-dominant hand to perform precision grasp tasks, then this area should be more involved when the left hand is used. \n\nWe considered an anatomy-based mask, involving three-dimensional cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps of premotor and motor cortices  ,   together with the anterior bank of the intraparietal sulcus   for both the left and the right hemispheres. All these maps are implemented with the Anatomy Toolbox  ,  . Moreover, the three-dimensional anatomic map for both cerebellar hemispheres, obtained through the anatomical parcellation of the MNI spatially normalized single-subject high-resolution T1 template  , was included in the mask. A global mask involving all these areas was created with the \u201cimCalc\u201d function implemented in SPM5. Then the mask was adopted as a searching area [Small Volume Correction, SVC \u2013 72]; only activations surviving the threshold of FWE .05 within the mask and associated with a probability value equal or greater than 60% within the respective cytoarchitectonic map were considered  . Anatomical labeling of fMRI results will refer to cytoarchitectonic maps. \n\n\n\n### Behavioural Experiment \n  \n#### Subjects \n  \nTwenty participants (7 men, 13 women; mean age 25.5\u00b13 years) volunteered to participate. Ten participants showed right-handed dominance (4 men, 6 women; mean age 25.8\u00b12.86 years) whereas ten showed left-handed dominance (3 men, 7 women; mean age 25.2\u00b13.26 years). Handedness was determined using a test for manual dominance  . None reported visual or psychomotor dysfunction. All subjects were na\u00efve as to the experimental design or purpose and gave their informed consent to participate in the study. The experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Padua and were in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n#### Apparatus and procedures \n  \nThe stimulus, the apparatus and the procedures were similar in all respects to those described for the fMRI experiment except that here a purely reaching condition was not considered. Infrared reflective markers (0.25 cm diameter) were taped to the following points on the subjects' upper limbs: (1) wrist \u2013 dorsodistal aspect of the radial styloid process; (2) thumb \u2013 ulnar side of the nail; and (3) index finger \u2013 radial side of the nail. Markers were fastened using double-sided tape. Movements were recorded using an ELITE motion analysis system (Bioengineering Technology & Systems [B|T|S]). Four infrared cameras (sampling rate 100 Hz) placed 120 cm away from each of the four corners of the table captured the movement of markers in 3D space. Coordinates of the markers were reconstructed with an accuracy of 0.2 mm over the field of view. The standard deviation of the reconstruction error was 0.2 mm for the vertical (Y) axis and 0.3 mm for the two horizontal (X and Z) axes. The experimenter was given on-line computer screen feedback of the three-dimensional position of each marker \u2013 if one marker was missing during task performance the trial was manually discarded. Experimentation continued until the required number of successful trials was collected (N\u200a=\u200a10) for each experimental condition (right handers/right hand; right-handers/left hand; left handers/right hand; left-handers/left hand). \n\n\n#### Data processing \n  \nThe ELIGRASP software package (B|T|S|) was used to analyze the data and provide a 3-D reconstruction of the marker positions as a function of time. The data were then filtered using a finite impulse response linear filter (transition band\u200a=\u200a1 Hz, sharpening variable\u200a=\u200a2, cutoff frequency\u200a=\u200a10 Hz). Following this operation, the tangential speed data for the wrist marker were used to determine the onset of the movement using a standard algorithm (threshold for movement onset was \u223c5 cm/s). Movement onset was taken as the earliest time at which movement of the wrist exceeded the set threshold. Movement offset was taken at the latest time at which the movement of the thumb and index finger occurred. For each subject the average value for the considered dependent measure (please refer to the \u2018 \u2019 section for the behavioural experiment) across trials was entered into an ANOVA with handedness (right-handers, left-handers) as a between-subjects factor and performing hand (RH, LH) as a within-subjects factor. Bonferroni corrections were applied to the contrasts of interest (throughout the text significant values are indicated). Preliminary analyses were conducted to check for normality, univariate and multivariate outliers, with no serious violations noted. \n\n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0003388-t001\n### Label: Table

Despite considerable debate about how this illusion arises psychologically, the neural underpinnings have not been studied. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural bases of audiovisual temporal distortions and more generally, intersensory timing. Adults underwent fMRI while judging the relative duration of successively presented standard interval\u2013comparison interval (CI) pairs, which were unimodal (A\u2013A, V\u2013V) or crossmodal (V\u2013A, A\u2013V). Mechanisms of time dilation and compression were identified by comparing the two crossmodal pairs. Mechanisms of intersensory timing were identified by comparing the unimodal and crossmodal conditions. The behavioral results showed that auditory CIs were perceived as lasting longer than visual CIs. There were three novel fMRI results. First, time dilation and compression were distinguished by differential activation of higher-sensory areas (superior temporal, posterior insula, middle occipital), which typically showed stronger effective connectivity when time was dilated (V\u2013A). Second, when time was compressed (A\u2013V) activation was greater in frontal cognitive-control centers, which guide decision making. These areas did not exhibit effective connectivity. Third, intrasensory timing was distinguished from intersensory timing partly by decreased striatal and increased superior parietal activation. These regions showed stronger connectivity with visual, memory, and cognitive-control centers during intersensory timing. Altogether, the results indicate that time dilation and compression arise from the connectivity strength of higher-sensory systems with other areas. Conversely, more extensive network interactions are needed with core timing (striatum) and attention (superior parietal) centers to integrate time codes for intersensory signals. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nHumans possess a remarkable ability to estimate the passage of time, which is vital for behavior. Yet the experience of time is not isomorphic to physical time and depends on many factors including properties of stimuli, past experiences, and behavioral contexts. For example, emotionally charged, larger magnitude, and more intense stimuli are known to expand estimates of time whereas events that are repeated, higher probability, and non-salient tend to compress perceived duration (Tse et al.,  ; Droit-Volet and Meck,  ; van Wassenhove et al.,  ; Eagleman and Pariyadath,  ; Matthews et al.,  ). Decades of psychophysical studies have debated the mechanisms of temporal distortions. By pacemaker-counter models (Penney et al.,  ; Ulrich et al.,  ), attention is a central factor that causes time to speed up or slow down by closing or opening a switch, which allows pulses generated from a clock during event timing to be accumulated and counted. Arousal is another factor that ostensibly increases the speed of the pacemaker. Indeed, the level of attention devoted to timing influences perceived duration (Casini and Macar,  ; Coull et al.,  ) as does heightened physiological arousal induced by emotionally negative sounds (Mella et al.,  ). However, a more complete understanding of how temporal distortions arise has been hampered by scant investigations into the underlying neural mechanisms. \n\nThe present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural underpinnings of the illusion that auditory (A) signals are perceived as lasting longer than visual (V) signals of the same physical duration when they are compared together (Wearden et al.,  ; Gamache and Grondin,  ). This temporal distortion is of considerable interest because an understanding of its mechanisms may help elucidate how synchrony is maintained across senses to form coherent representations of multisensory events. The modality effect on perceived duration is often attributed to a pacemaker\u2013accumulator \u201cclock\u201d system that runs faster for auditory than visual stimuli, possibly due to an attentional switch that allows pulses to accumulate faster for auditory information (Penney et al.,  ; Wearden et al.,  ). Audiovisual distortions are classically studied using the temporal bisection procedure. However, the present study employed a comparison procedure wherein a standard interval (SI) and a comparison interval (CI) were successively presented, and participants judged whether the CI was longer or shorter in duration than the SI (Ulrich et al.,  ). SI\u2013CI pairs were either unimodal (A\u2013A, V\u2013V) or crossmodal (V\u2013A, A\u2013V). Using this method, V\u2013A pairs are perceived as lasting longer than A\u2013V pairs, which is due to the longer interpulse time for visual than auditory CIs (Ulrich et al.,  ). \n\nOur primary aim was to identify neural systems underlying time dilation and compression by comparing activation patterns in the crossmodal conditions (V\u2013A versus A\u2013V) where the amount of visual and auditory stimulation was the same. Our hypotheses were motivated by the striatal beat frequency (SBF) model (Matell and Meck,  ), which suggests that audiovisual differences in timing could arise from cortical oscillatory patterns in the cortex or from the striatum. Specifically, the time code for signal duration is thought to arise from the firing of cortical neurons that have different oscillation rates, which should produce distinct temporal and spatial signatures for auditory and visual signals. On the other hand, the striatum serves as a core timer by detecting and integrating cortical oscillatory states over time. Thus, activation in auditory and visual centers should differ between the crossmodal conditions if modality effects are related to different temporal signatures in sensory and association regions of the cortex. Alternatively, striatal activation should differ between the crossmodal conditions if modality effects are related to differences in the rate of detecting and integrating auditory and visual oscillatory states. We also were interested in whether interactions of the brain with key regions that modulated modality effects were stronger for the time dilation than the compression condition (i.e., effective connectivity). If time dilation is due to an attentional mechanism that favors auditory signals (Penney et al.,  ; Wearden et al.,  ), connectivity might be stronger for V\u2013A than A\u2013V comparisons. \n\nA secondary aim was to investigate neural mechanisms that distinguish intrasensory from intersensory timing by comparing the unimodal and crossmodal conditions in regions that did not exhibit time dilation or compression effects. Current knowledge of the neural underpinnings of temporal processing comes solely from studies of intrasensory timing. Intersensory timing presumably differs in that attention must be switched between senses and time codes must be integrated across senses. Although not explicitly addressed by the SBF model, the detection and integration of oscillatory states by the striatum might be enhanced when timing signals within the same modality because they share similar spatial signatures, which facilitates temporal integration, thereby producing a more robust neuronal response relative to crossmodal timing. If the striatum differentially modulates intra- and intersensory timing, we also speculated that the strength of striatal interactions with the cortex would differ for unimodal and crossmodal timing. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty healthy adults participated in the study (8 female and 12 male; mean age\u2009=\u200924.4\u2009years, range: 19\u201335\u2009years, SD\u2009=\u20094.5; mean education\u2009=\u200915.5\u2009years, range: 13\u201320\u2009years, SD\u2009=\u20091.6). Participants were excluded if they had a history of neurologic disturbance (e.g., seizures, head injury), learning disability, major psychiatric disturbance, or substance abuse. All participants gave their written informed consent according to guidelines of the Human Research Protections Program at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). \n\n\n### fMRI task \n  \nParticipants performed a time perception task while undergoing fMRI scanning. The task involved presentation of filled-auditory (1000\u2009Hz pure tones) and visual (blue ellipse) stimuli. Tone stimuli were delivered binaurally through a headphone that together with earplugs attenuated background scanner noise by about 40\u2009db. Visual stimuli were viewed through a NordicNeuroLab goggle system. Participants made a two-choice key-press response on a button box using the index or middle finger of their right hand. \n\nFigure  A shows the experimental design and trial events. Pairs of auditory (A) and/or visual (V) stimuli were successively presented. In two unimodal conditions, the SI and the CI were of the same modality (A\u2013A, V\u2013V) and in two crossmodal conditions they were different (A\u2013V, V\u2013A). Throughout the experiment, the subject maintained fixation on a white cross at the center of the display. Prior to trial onset, a warning signal (i.e., flashing yellow cross and mixed 700-Hz tone) appeared for 350\u2009ms followed by a 500-ms delay. A trial began with the presentation of the SI, followed by a 1.5-s delay, and then the CI. The participant indicated if the CI was shorter or longer than the SI by pressing a key with the right index or middle finger, respectively. Four SIs (1467, 1540, 1620, and 1710\u2009ms) were used to increase the demands of encoding an interval on each trial (Figure  B). For each SI, there were three shorter and three longer CIs that differed from the SI by successive increments of \u00b17%. Accuracy and reaction time (RT; measured from CI offset to the key press) were recorded. \n  \n Time perception task  .   (A)   Trial of events for each of the four conditions. Pairs of auditory (A) and/or visual (V) stimuli were successively presented. The standard (SI) and the comparison (CI) intervals were of the same modality in the unimodal conditions (A\u2013A, V\u2013V) and were different modalities in the crossmodal conditions (A\u2013V, V\u2013A). Prior to trial onset, a warning signal (flashing yellow cross and mixed 700-Hz tone) appeared for 350\u2009ms followed by a 500-ms delay. A trial began with the presentation of the SI, followed by a 1.5-s delay, and then the CI. The participant indicated if the CI was shorter or longer than the SI by pressing a key with the right index or middle finger, respectively.   (B)   SI and CI durations. There were four different SIs. Each SI was paired with three shorter and three longer CIs that differed from the SI by successive increments of \u00b17%. \n  \nThere were 24 trials per condition (i.e., A\u2013A, V\u2013V, A\u2013V, V\u2013A). Within each of the conditions there were four trials per CI (i.e., 7, 14, and 21% shorter or longer than the SI). These trials were equally divided among the four different SI\u2013CI combinations (Figure  B). The order of the conditions was randomized across four runs, each of which contained 24 trials. At the end of the CI, there was a 3-s \u201cfiller\u201d epoch (i.e., fixation) wherein subjects made their response. At the end of this response window, the inter-trial interval was jittered between 3 and 7\u2009s to allow for the best sampling of the hemodynamic response and establishment of a baseline resting state in the model (i.e., fixation plus ambient scanner noise). Six additional filler images were added to the beginning and the end of each run to respectively allow for T1 equilibration and the delayed hemodynamic response of the final trial. Each run consisted of 180 images acquired over 6\u2009min. \n\n\n### MRI methods \n  \n#### Image acquisition \n  \nEvent-related fMRI was conducted at the UCSD Center for FMRI using a GE 3-T Excite MRI system equipped with an 8-channel head coil. Foam padding was used to limit head motion within the coil. Prior to functional imaging, high-resolution T1-weighted anatomic images were collected for anatomic localization and co-registration (TE 3.0\u2009ms, TR 7.8\u2009ms, 12\u00b0 flip angle, NEX 1, 1-mm axial slice thickness, FOV 25\u2009cm, 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 matrix). Echo-planar images were acquired using a single-shot, blipped, gradient-echo, echo-planar pulse sequence (TE 30\u2009ms, TR 2.0\u2009s, 90\u00b0 flip angle, FOV 24\u2009cm, 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 matrix, NEX 1, interleaved slice acquisition). Each functional imaging volume included 37 contiguous, axial 4-mm slices (3.75-mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093.75-mm\u2009\u00d7\u20094-mm voxel size) to provide coverage of the entire brain. \n\n\n#### Image analysis \n  \nFunctional images were generated using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) software. Time series images were spatially registered in three-dimensional space and corrected for time-slice acquisition differences. The time series for each participant was deconvolved using trial onset (i.e., presentation of the SI) separately for each of the four conditions (A\u2013A, V\u2013V, A\u2013V, V\u2013A). This analysis produces hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) of the fMRI signal on a voxel-wise basis. The HRFs are estimates of the hemodynamic response for each condition relative to the baseline state (i.e., filler images), and are generated without making   a priori   assumptions about the shape, delay, or magnitude of the HRF. The deconvolution was modeled for 8 time points (i.e., 16\u2009s). Six head-motion parameters were included as covariates of no interest. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the volumes that captured peak activation during the SI (volumes 2 and 3 beginning at 4.0 and 6.0\u2009s post-trial onset) and the CI and response (volumes 4 and 5 beginning at 8.0 and 10.0\u2009s post-trial onset). AUC maps were then interpolated to volumes with 1-mm  voxels, co-registered, converted to Talairach coordinate-space, and blurred using a 6-mm Gaussian full-width half maximum filter. \n\nRepeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed on a voxel-wise basis to generate statistical parametric maps that identified voxels that showed main effects of timing condition (unimodal, crossmodal), CI modality (auditory, visual), and the interaction. Voxel-wise thresholds were derived from 3000 Monte Carlo simulations (AFNI AlphaSim), which computed the voxel-probability and minimum cluster-size threshold needed to obtain a 0.05 familywise alpha. Because spatial thresholds are biased against smaller activation clusters of   a priori   interest (i.e., basal ganglia), statistical thresholds were derived separately for basal ganglia and cortical volumes (Worsley et al.,  ). This was accomplished by creating a basal ganglia mask (i.e., putamen, globus pallidus, caudate) using the Talairach Daemon dataset; the mask was then expanded to include any voxels within a 2-mm radius. The cortical mask included all other regions of the brain. Each mask was used in the Monte Carlo simulations to determine the appropriate combination of individual voxel-probability and minimum cluster-size threshold. For the basal ganglia volume, we used a voxel-wise threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.006 and a minimum cluster size of 0.338\u2009ml. For the cortical volume, we used a voxel-wise threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.004 and a minimum cluster size of 0.675\u2009ml. \n\nThe objectives of our study were to investigate regional differences associated with (1) signal modality (A\u2013A versus V\u2013V), (2) timing condition (unimodal versus crossmodal), and (3) the interaction of modality\u2009\u00d7\u2009timing condition. Planned comparisons of significant interactions focused on the contrast between the two crossmodal pairs (A\u2013V versus V\u2013A) since this directly tests for regional activation associated with the time dilation effect while controlling for sensory processing demands. To accomplish these objectives, a functional region of interest (fROI) analysis was conducted to directly evaluate regional differences associated with each of these effects. The fROI map was generated by conjoining activated regions associated with the main effect and interaction tests that were identified in the above voxel-wise analyses. As some fROI were quite large, we separated them into smaller regions along minimum contour lines of the voxel-wise map using a watershed algorithm. This algorithm first uses AFNI 3dExtrema to find a set of local maxima separated by at least 20\u2009mm and then creates boundaries for clusters containing these maxima along the minimum value contour lines (Cox,  ). The watershed algorithm was applied to the conjoined fROI map using the normalized maximum intensity value from each voxel. The results from   F   tests conducted on the fROI were the focus of the study. \n\n\n#### Effective connectivity analyses \n  \nWe also asked if connectivity of key regions with the entire brain were modulated by the timing condition (unimodal versus crossmodal) or by dilation/compression effects on perceived duration (V\u2013A versus A\u2013V). This was achieved by conducting voxel-based tests of psychophysiological interactions (PPI; Friston et al.,  ) for key regions, which were identified by the above fROI analyses. For PPI analyses pertaining to timing condition, key regions were selected that (1) exhibited differences between the unimodal and crossmodal conditions, (2) did not show a timing condition\u2009\u00d7\u2009CI modality interaction, and (3) have been implicated in temporal processing. For PPI analyses pertaining to time dilation/compression, key regions were selected that exhibited a timing condition\u2009\u00d7\u2009CI modality interaction that was related to differences in activation between the two crossmodal pairs (V\u2013A versus A\u2013V). Voxels in these key regions were the seed ROI and were selected for each subject based on the conjunctive maps generated for the fROI analyses. Seeds were constructed by drawing a 5-mm radius sphere that was centered close to the peak activation within a fROI. In one PPI analysis, the experimental variable was the timing condition (unimodal versus crossmodal). In the other PPI analysis, the experimental variable was the time dilation/compression effect (V\u2013A versus A\u2013V). Multiplication of the deconvolved time series for the seed areas with each experimental variable formed the interaction term (i.e., PPI regressor), which tested whether connectivity of a key region with the whole brain was modulated by the experimental variable. A   p  \u2009<\u20090.006 voxel-wise threshold and a 0.338-ml minimum cluster size was the criterion for significance. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nThe analyses collapsed across SI duration. Hence, CIs that were \u00b17, 14, and 21% increments of the SI duration were also averaged. The main dependent measure was accuracy, which was converted to the percent longer responses for each CI. A repeated-measures ANOVA tested the main effect of CI modality (auditory, visual), timing condition (unimodal, crossmodal), CI duration (\u00b17, 14, 21%), and the interactions. The Huynh\u2013Feldt correction was applied to multiple DOF effects to adjust for violations of sphericity. The main results are graphed in Figure  . \n  \n Task performance during fMRI scanning  . Accuracy data were converted to the mean (standard error bars) percent longer and then averaged across the standard interval (SI) conditions and their respective comparison intervals (CIs). The left graph shows the mean percent longer responses for each unimodal (A\u2013A, V\u2013V) and crossmodal (V\u2013A, A\u2013V) condition. The right graph plots the mean percent longer responses for the unimodal and crossmodal conditions as a function of the CI duration. On the   x   axis, \u00b17, 14, and 21 designate CIs that were 7, 14, and 21% shorter (negative values) or longer (positive values) than the SI. \n  \nAll first-order interactions were significant [CI modality\u2009\u00d7\u2009timing condition:   F  (1,19)\u2009=\u200996.3,   p  \u2009<\u20090.0001, \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.84; timing condition\u2009\u00d7\u2009CI duration:   F  (4.4, 83)\u2009=\u20098.3,   p  \u2009<\u20090.0001, \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.30; CI modality\u2009\u00d7\u2009CI duration:   F  (5,95)\u2009=\u20092.8,   p  \u2009<\u20090.025, \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.13]. Planned comparisons of the CI modality\u2009\u00d7\u2009timing condition interaction (Figure  , left graph) showed that in the unimodal condition, visual CIs were perceived as lasting longer than auditory CIs [V\u2013V\u2009>\u2009A\u2013A;   F  (1,19)\u2009=\u200921.0,   p  \u2009<\u20090.0001, \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.53]. Though no differences were expected between A\u2013A and V\u2013V pairs, this was found previously (Ulrich et al.,  ) and relates to the greater variability in timing visual signals (Merchant et al.,  ; Grondin and McAuley,  ). In contrast, auditory CIs were perceived as lasting longer than visual CIs in the crossmodal conditions [V\u2013A\u2009>\u2009A\u2013V;   F  (1,19)\u2009=\u200970.6,   p  \u2009<\u20090.0001, \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.79]. Pairwise comparisons between the unimodal and crossmodal conditions indicated that perceived duration was dilated for intersensory timing of auditory CIs [A\u2013A\u2009<\u2009V\u2013A;   F  (1,19)\u2009=\u200947.8,   p  \u2009<\u20090.0001, \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.72; V\u2013V\u2009<\u2009V\u2013A;   F  (1,19)\u2009=\u20096.7,   p  \u2009<\u20090.02, \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.26] and was compressed for intersensory timing of visual CIs [A\u2013A\u2009>\u2009A\u2013V;   F  (1,19)\u2009=\u200922.9,   p  \u2009<\u20090.0001, \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.55; V\u2013V\u2009>\u2009A\u2013V;   F  (1,19)\u2009=\u200979.9,   p  \u2009<\u20090.0001, \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.81]. The timing condition\u2009\u00d7\u2009CI duration interaction showed that differences between the two timing conditions grew as CI duration increased (Figure  , right graph). The CI modality\u2009\u00d7\u2009CI duration interaction showed that CI modality differences also grew as CI duration increased. The second-order interaction was not significant [  F  (3.9,75)\u2009=\u20091.8,   p  \u2009=\u20090.14]. \n\nSecondary analyses of the RT data showed a trend for a CI modality\u2009\u00d7\u2009timing condition interaction [  F  (1,19)\u2009=\u20093.8,   p  \u2009=\u20090.067, \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.17]. Planned comparisons showed the interaction was due to faster RTs for V\u2013A (mean\u2009=\u2009776.3\u2009ms, SE\u2009=\u200950.5) than A\u2013V pairs (mean\u2009=\u2009899.9\u2009ms, SE\u2009=\u200951.0) [  t  (1,19)\u2009=\u20093.1,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01], but not for A\u2013A (mean\u2009=\u2009861.7\u2009ms, SE\u2009=\u200950.2) than V\u2013V pairs (mean\u2009=\u2009874.1\u2009ms; SE\u2009=\u200952.1). \n\n\n### MRI results \n  \n#### Functional ROI results \n  \nThe conjoined fMRI activation masks in Figures   and   display 25 regions that exhibited effects of CI modality, timing condition, and/or an interaction. Table   provides the details of these activation foci. For each fROI, the table also summarizes the results from statistical analyses that tested for the effects of signal modality (A\u2013A versus V\u2013V), timing condition (unimodal versus crossmodal), and the interaction of modality\u2009\u00d7\u2009timing condition. \n  \n Cortical functional ROI (fROI)  . Twenty-one cortical fROI were identified by conjoining activation maps from the voxel-wise analyses. Tests of modality, timing condition, and the interaction were conducted on these fROI. The fROI are color coded according to whether activation was affected by each of these factors. In all three columns, purple denotes no effect of a particular factor on activation. For the test of modality (left column), red designates a significant difference between the A\u2013A and V\u2013V conditions. For the test of timing condition (middle column), yellow signifies a significant difference between the unimodal and the crossmodal conditions. In the right column, green signifies a significant CI modality\u2009\u00d7\u2009timing condition interaction. \n    \n Subcortical functional ROI (fROI)  . Four subcortical fROI were identified by conjoining the activation maps from the voxel-wise analyses. In all of the fROI, activation was greater in the unimodal than the crossmodal timing condition. No other effects were significant.   z   coordinates are the superior (+)/inferior (\u2212) distance in millimeter from the anterior commissure. \n    \n Regions showing significant effects of modality, timing condition, and the interaction  . \n  \n Brodmann areas (BA) were defined by the Talairach and Tournoux atlas. Coordinates represent distance in millimeter from anterior commissure:   x  , right (+)/left (\u2212);   y  , anterior (+)/posterior (\u2212);   z  , superior (+)/inferior (\u2212). Regional volumes are expressed in milliliter. B, bilateral hemispheres; L, left hemisphere; R, right hemisphere; SMA, supplementary motor area; MFG, middle frontal gyrus; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; LBG, lateral geniculate body  . \n  \n##### Audition versus vision \n  \nTable   and Figure   (left column; red) show that the modality of unimodal pairs affected activation largely in posterior cortical areas including in the parietal (superior parietal cortex and precuneus), temporal (posterior portions of superior temporal cortex and insula, middle temporal cortex, parahippocampus, hippocampus), and occipital cortices (middle-occipital cortex and cuneus). An exception was the modality effect on activation of the medial frontal/anterior cingulate areas. In most regions activation was greater for visual than auditory unimodal pairs, except for the medial frontal/anterior cingulate and superior temporal/insular cortices wherein activation was greater for auditory than visual pairs. \n\n\n##### Intrasensory versus intersensory timing \n  \nTable  , Figure   (middle column; yellow), and Figure   show that the timing condition also affected activation of the frontal [SMA, precentral, paracentral, middle frontal gyrus (MFG)/ inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)], superior parietal, temporal [middle temporal gyrus (MTG), parahippocampus, hippocampus], and middle-occipital cortices, the thalamus (pulvinar nucleus, lateral geniculate body) and the basal ganglia (putamen, caudate body). Figure   displays graphs of signal change for the unimodal and crossmodal conditions in representative regions. For most regions, activation was greater for unimodal than crossmodal pairs. Exceptions included the MFG/IFG and superior parietal cortex, wherein activation was greater for crossmodal than unimodal pairs. Activation was also greater for the crossmodal than the unimodal condition, but negative, in the right SMA/paracentral lobule and the left parahippocampus/hippocampus (Table  , clusters 14 and 15). \n  \n Signal change in regions showing an effect of timing condition  . Graphs display representative regions showing differences in activation between the unimodal (A\u2013A, V\u2013V) and crossmodal (V\u2013A, A\u2013V) conditions. Mean (standard error bars) area under the curve (AUC) is plotted for each condition. Bracketed numbers reference regions detailed in Table  . L, left hemisphere; R, right hemisphere; B, bilateral hemispheres; SMA, supplementary motor area; MFG, middle frontal gyrus; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus. \n  \n\n##### Time dilation and compression \n  \nTable   and Figure   (right column; green) display regions wherein CI modality interacted with the timing condition. All posterior, but not anterior, regions that showed an interaction also showed modality effects (A\u2013A versus V\u2013V; Figure  , left column; red). However, we were principally interested in whether activation differed between the two crossmodal pairs (V\u2013A versus A\u2013V) since this contrast directly tests for regional activation associated with time dilation and compression, while controlling for the amount of auditory and visual stimulation. There were three patterns of interactions. First, for the left medial frontal/anterior cingulate, the interaction was due to greater activation in the auditory than the visual unimodal condition (Table  ), yet no difference between A\u2013V and V\u2013A pairs (  p  \u2009>\u20090.10). Second, Figure   shows that for the left preSMA and MFG/IFG, the interaction was due to greater activation for the A\u2013V than the V\u2013A pairs (  p  \u2009<\u20090.0001 and   p  \u2009<\u20090.02, respectively); auditory and visual unimodal conditions did not differ. For the third interaction pattern, Table   and Figure   show that large regional biases for timing unimodal auditory (right and left superior temporal/insula cortex) or visual pairs (right and left middle-occipital cortex) translated into smaller, but significant differences between the two crossmodal conditions. Specifically, activation was greater for V\u2013A pairs in the right and left superior temporal/insula cortex (  p  \u2009<\u20090.006 and   p  \u2009<\u20090.02, respectively) and greater for A\u2013V pairs in the right and left middle-occipital cortex (Table  , clusters 16, 17, 19;   p  \u2009<\u20090.002,   p  \u2009<\u20090.007, and   p  \u2009<\u20090.01, respectively). Finally, for all other regions listed in Table  ,   post hoc   comparisons between A\u2013V and V\u2013A pairs were non-significant. \n  \n Signal change in regions showing an interaction  . Graphs display regions showing a CI modality\u2009\u00d7\u2009timing condition interaction. Mean (standard error bars) area under the curve (AUC) is plotted for each condition. An asterisk designates the significance of key follow-up planned comparisons between the unimodal (A\u2013A versus V\u2013V) and crossmodal (V\u2013A versus A\u2013V) conditions. Bracketed numbers reference regions detailed in Table  . L, left hemisphere; R, right hemisphere; SMA, supplementary motor area; MFG, middle frontal gyrus; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; PH, parahippocampus. \n  \n\n\n#### Effective connectivity results \n  \n##### Intrasensory versus intersensory timing \n  \nFor the connectivity analyses that used timing condition as an experimental variable, six seed ROI were selected including the left and right putamen (\u221226, \u22128, 11; 23, 0, 8), right caudate body (10, 10, 8), left and right SMA (\u221211, \u221216, 66; 5, \u221226, 55), and left superior parietal cortex (\u221234, \u221255, 50). The left putamen failed to show significant connectivity with other regions. Figure   displays spatial maps of regions exhibiting significant effective connectivity with each seed that was modulated by the timing condition. Table   describes the details of these interacting regions. For all seeds, effective connectivity was stronger in the crossmodal than the unimodal condition. The striatum and most cortical ROI showed connectivity with encoding/retrieval hubs (posterior cingulate, precuneus). The right caudate also showed connectivity with cognitive control [rostral medial frontal (BA 10), higher association (inferior parietal), and visual centers (MTG, lingual gyrus, vermis; Figure  A)]. Connectivity of the left and/or right SMA was found with cognitive control [e.g., preSMA, precentral gyrus, MFG/superior frontal gyrus (SFG; BA 10, 47), IFG (BA 45, 47), memory (parahippocampus), and visual centers (fusiform and lingual gyrus), and with the ventral putamen and cerebellum (declive/culmen; Figure  B)]. Left superior parietal cortex showed connectivity with cognitive control [preSMA/SMA, MFG (6), IFG (BA 9)] and visual centers (MTG), and with the thalamus (Figure  C). \n  \n Regions showing connectivity with the striatum, SMA, and parietal cortex that was modulated by timing condition  .

Brodmann areas (BA) were defined by the Talairach and Tournoux atlas. Cerebellar lobules were defined by the Schmahmann atlas (Schmahmann et al.,  ). Coordinates represent distance in millimeter from anterior commissure:   x  , right (+)/left (\u2212);   y  , anterior (+)/posterior (\u2212);   z  , superior (+)/inferior (\u2212).

Of these seeds, effective connectivity was not found for the left preSMA, left MFG, and two occipital seeds (Table  , clusters 1, 6, 16, and 17). Figure   displays spatial maps of regions showing significant effective connectivity with each seed that was modulated by the time dilation and compression conditions. Table   describes the details of these interacting regions. Two patterns of effective connectivity were found. First, the predominant pattern was characterized by stronger connectivity in the V\u2013A \u201ctime dilation\u201d condition. For this pattern, the right and/or left superior temporal cortex showed connectivity with cognitive control [MFG (BA 6, 9, 10), IFG (6), SMA, preSMA], attention/association (superior/inferior parietal), sensory integration (anterior insula, claustrum), and visual centers, and with the caudate body and culmen (Figure  A). Similarly, the left and/or right insula showed connectivity with cognitive control (SMA, preSMA), higher association (inferior parietal), and sensory integration areas (anterior insula), and with the putamen (Figure  B). By comparison, the left middle-occipital seed showed more limited connectivity with sensory integration (anterior insula) and visual centers (cuneus; Figure  C). Second, a less common pattern was characterized by stronger connectivity of some seeds with medial cortical areas in the A\u2013V \u201ctime compression\u201d condition (Figures  A,B, sagittal views). Specifically, the left superior temporal cortex and the left and right insula showed stronger connectivity with rostral medial frontal cortex (9, 10) for A\u2013V pairs. The right superior temporal cortex also showed stronger connectivity with the cingulate (BA 30, 31). \n  \n Regions showing effective connectivity with cortical ROI that was modulated by the effects of time dilation and compression on perceived duration (V\u2013A versus A\u2013V)  . \n  \n Regions showing effective connectivity with each seed region (bold font) are displayed in Figure   . \n\n Brodmann areas (BA) were defined by the Talairach and Tournoux atlas.

See Table   for details about individual activation foci. \n  \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur behavioral findings confirmed that auditory CIs were perceived as lasting longer than visual CIs in the crossmodal condition (Ulrich et al.,  ). Moreover, pairwise comparisons of each crossmodal and unimodal condition demonstrated that perceived duration was dilated when the CI was auditory (V\u2013A) and compressed when it was visual (A\u2013V). Additionally, crossmodal RTs were faster when perceived duration was dilated, possibly because auditory signals are more salient in the context of temporal processing, wherein audition dominates vision (Repp and Penel,  ; Recanzone,  ; Mayer et al.,  ). We also found that differences between the unimodal and crossmodal conditions in judgments of time grew with CI duration, irrespective of CI modality. By pacemaker-accumulator models, this result suggests that intersensory timing affects the flow of pulses from the pacemaker rather than a delay in the start of the clock, which would have a constant effect across CI durations (Wearden et al.,  ,  ; Penney et al.,  ). \n\nThe neural underpinnings of these behavioral findings were elucidated for the first time by the present study, which uncovered four main findings. First, we showed that time dilation and compression were distinguished by differential activation of higher-sensory areas (superior temporal/insula, middle occipital) associated with the modality of the CI. Effective connectivity of these areas with middle frontal and parietal cortices, anterior insula, and the striatum was typically stronger when perceived duration was dilated (V\u2013A). We suspect that this result is due to the engagement of distributed neural networks when timing more salient auditory signals. Second, time compression (A\u2013V) was characterized by greater activation of cognitive-control centers (preSMA, MFG/IFG), although these centers did not exhibit effective connectivity with other regions. This finding suggests that A\u2013V comparisons required more cognitive effort, consistent with the longer RTs when perceived duration was compressed. Third, audiovisual distortions in subjective duration were not mediated by the striatum, suggesting that the rate of detection or integration of cortical oscillatory states is not faster for auditory than visual signals. Fourth, intersensory timing was distinguished from intrasensory timing by decreased activation of the striatum and SMA, but increased activation of an attention center (superior parietal cortex). These regions showed stronger connectivity with frontal, parietal, and visual areas during crossmodal than unimodal timing, which may signify the greater demands on core timing and attention systems in integrating audiovisual time codes. We now turn to a more complete discussion of these findings. \n\n### Time dilation and compression \n  \nAudiovisual distortions in perceived duration were largely distinguished by activity in higher-sensory areas, wherein the magnitude of activation and the strength of effective connectivity both depended on the time dilation/compression conditions. Despite equivalent stimulation of the two senses, activation was greater in bilateral superior temporal and posterior insular cortex when perceived duration was dilated (V\u2013A) and greater in bilateral middle-occipital cortex when it was compressed (A\u2013V). These results indicated that the modality of the CI drove differential activation in these areas, consistent with their respective bias for timing unimodal auditory or visual signals. At the same time, secondary auditory and visual centers are multisensory (Ghazanfar and Schroeder,  ) and are thought to support audiovisual integration (Calvert,  ; Klemen and Chambers,  ). This prospect was suggested by our effective connectivity results wherein higher-sensory areas typically showed stronger connectivity when time was dilated rather than compressed. \n\nCommon to all of these higher-sensory areas was stronger connectivity with the anterior insula. The insula integrates processing from disparate domains (e.g., interoception, working memory, emotion) including time (Nenadic et al.,  ; Harrington et al.,  ; Kosillo and Smith,  ; Wittmann et al.,  ). It has also been linked to the dilation of perceived duration by salient features of visual signals (Wittmann et al.,  ). Importantly, the insula mediates the perception of audiovisual asynchrony (Bushara et al.,  ; Calvert et al.,  ), implicating it in the synthesis of crossmodal signals based on their temporal correspondence. The anterior insula is also thought to be an attentional hub that assists central executive networks in generating accurate responses to salient or task-relevant events (Menon and Uddin,  ). Auditory signals are more salient than visual signals in the context of temporal processing (Repp and Penel,  ; Recanzone,  ; Mayer et al.,  ). This is likely due to past experiences in timing principally via audition (e.g., music, speech), which over time may build up the connectivity strength of networks that mediate temporal processing of auditory signals. Thus, enhanced sensitivity in the anterior insula to auditory oscillatory patterns may contribute to time dilation. Time dilation was also related to stronger connectivity of superior temporal and insular cortices with the striatum (caudate and putamen), an alleged core-timing system (Matell and Meck,  ), and with higher association areas (parietal cortex), sensorimotor areas (cerebellum), and cognitive-control centers (preSMA, MFG, IFG), which are also involved in audiovisual integration (Lewis et al.,  ; Bushara et al.,  ; Calvert et al.,  ). By comparison, only one of three middle-occipital fROI showed effective connectivity, which was inter-regionally restricted to the anterior insula. Taken together, these results indicate that a mechanism underlying audiovisual temporal distortions is the strength of superior temporal/posterior insular cortex connectivity with distributed networks that mediate multisensory integration, cognitive control, and timekeeping. \n\nA less common finding was stronger connectivity in the time compression condition of the left superior temporal and bilateral insular cortices with medial cortical regions involved in more abstract decision making (rostral medial frontal; BA 9, 10) and executive control (posterior cingulate). This circumscribed connectivity pattern may reflect the greater difficulty of A\u2013V than V\u2013A judgments, consistent with their longer RTs. This prospect was also supported by our fROI analyses, wherein activation was greater in classic working memory and attention regions (preSMA, MFG, IFG) when time was compressed than when it was dilated. These regions, however, did not exhibit significant effective connectivity. This leads us to conclude that the preSMA and MFG/IFG are supramodal centers that direct attention and working memory resources during intersensory timing, but do not give rise to audiovisual effects on perceived duration   per se  . \n\n\n### Intersensory and intrasensory timing \n  \nOur fROI results did not suggest that audiovisual distortions in subjective duration were mediated by the striatum. Rather, we found that putamen and caudate activation was greater when timing unimodal than crossmodal signals, irrespective of the CI modality. This result was not consistent with classic attentional switching accounts of striatal function (van Schouwenburg et al.,  ), wherein greater activation would be expected in the crossmodal than the unimodal condition. Attentional switching should also produce a constant effect on perceived duration across CI durations for the crossmodal condition, which was not found. \n\nThe mechanisms by which time is synthesized across the senses are not understood. Crossmodal stimulation often enhances neuronal responses in multisensory integration centers (e.g., superior colliculus, association areas; Calvert et al.,  ), including the striatum (Nagy et al.,  ), but depression of neuronal responses is also found, especially when intersensory signals are spatially incongruent or asynchronous as in our study (Calvert et al.,  ). Increased striatal activation during unimodal timing may relate to the role of the striatum in detecting and integrating cortical oscillatory states, which provide the temporal code for signal duration (Matell and Meck,  ). Stronger striatal responses might arise when timing unimodal signals because they share similar spatial signatures. Detection and temporal integration of oscillatory states might therefore speed up because evidence for the time code accumulates faster when the CI duration can be mapped onto the neural time-code of the SI modality, which is active in memory. Conversely, different spatial signatures for crossmodal signals may render temporal integration noisy, resulting in a diminished striatal response. Though speculative, this account may also relate to the increased activation and reduced suppression in the left and right SMA for unimodal than crossmodal timing. The SMA is sensitive to elapsed time (Pouthas et al.,  ; Mita et al.,  ; Wencil et al.,  ), but unlike the striatum, it mediates maintenance of temporal and non-temporal information (Harrington et al.,  ). The SMA may therefore maintain temporal representations online for other networks to make use of to affect behavior. Stronger SMA activation when timing unimodal than crossmodal signals may signify a stronger neural representation of the time code. \n\nDespite the increased activation of the striatum and SMA during intrasensory timing, connectivity of these areas with the brain was stronger during crossmodal timing. For example, these regions showed stronger connectivity with a core memory hub (precuneus, posterior cingulate, parahippocampus), possibly signifying the greater dependence of striatum and SMA on output from encoding and retrieval systems during intersensory timing. The caudate and SMA also showed stronger connectivity with visual (fusiform and lingual gyrus, MTG), but not auditory centers, and frontal cognitive-control centers (medial frontal, MFG, SFG, IFG). These findings may relate in part to the more deliberate timing of visual signals (Repp and Penel,  ; Mayer et al.,  ), which renders synthesis of audiovisual temporal codes more difficult. \n\nIntersensory timing was also associated with increased activation of a frontal\u2013parietal attention network. Though increased MFG/IFG activation was largely related to the more difficult A\u2013V judgments, our results suggest that the synthesis of audiovisual temporal codes increases attentional processing in the superior parietal cortex, irrespective of the CI modality. This was consistent with the stronger connectivity of the superior parietal cortex with frontal control-systems (MFG, IFG) during crossmodal timing, but also with higher visual areas (MTG) and a memory encoding hub (precuneus, posterior cingulate). Altogether, these effective connectivity patterns suggest that more extensive network interactions with the striatum, SMA, and superior parietal cortex are needed to time intersensory than intrasensory signals. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur results indicate that audiovisual effects on the experience of time emanate from higher-sensory areas, in which connectivity is stronger and far more inter-regionally distributed when timing auditory than visual signals. Though we found greater activation in cognitive-control centers for the more difficult (time compression) than easy (time dilation) crossmodal comparisons, effective connectivity of these regions was not modulated by the modality effect. This may suggest that cognitive-control centers play a supramodal role in directing attention or allocating working memory resources during decision making. We also found that audiovisual distortions in perceived duration were not driven by the striatum, suggesting that the presumed core-timing system (Matell and Meck,  ) operates at the same rate for visual and auditory signals. Rather, during crossmodal timing, striatal activation was decreased and connectivity was stronger with visual, memory encoding and cognitive-control centers. These findings were attributed to the greater demands on striatal integration of crossmodal time codes. The present findings have implications for understanding neural mechanisms of temporal processing distortions in maturation and disease. For example, enhanced modality effects in children (Droit-Volet et al.,  ) and in individuals at risk for schizophrenia (Penney et al.,  ) are due to impaired timing of visual signals. Our results suggest that this might arise from developmental differences and preclinical changes in frontal cognitive-control centers, but also the connectivity of higher-sensory association areas with executive control centers (medial cortex). Conversely, audiovisual distortions in perceived duration are diminished in diagnosed schizophrenics, largely due to inaccurate timing of auditory signals (Carroll et al.,  ). This is consistent with changes in temporal cortex in schizophrenia, which may well alter inter-regional connectivity. Altogether, the present study demonstrates that intersensory synthesis of temporal information and time dilation and compression effects are mediated by different patterns of regional activation and inter-regional connectivity. Future studies are needed that further elucidate interactions among multiple brain regions, which are fundamental to temporal processing and likely breakdown in certain neurological and psychiatric disorders. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nRegion\tBA\tx\ty\tz\tml\tModality???\tTiming condition???\tInteraction???\nFRONTAL\tFRONTAL\tFRONTAL\tFRONTAL\tFRONTAL\tFRONTAL\tFRONTAL\tFRONTAL\tFRONTAL\nL preSMA\t6\t\u22127\t6\t56\t1.2\t\u2013\t\u2013\t0.0001\nL SMA, precentral\t6\t\u221216\t\u221221\t56\t2.6\t\u2013\t0.0001\t\u2013\nR SMA, paracentral\t6\t14\t\u221231\t55\t1.5\t\u2013\t0.0001???\t\u2013\nL precentral\t4,6\t\u221257\t\u22126\t31\t1.0\t\u2013\t0.0001\t\u2013\nL medial frontal, anterior cingulate\t9,32\t\u221221\t34\t14\t1.1\t0.005a\t\u2013\t0.0001\nL MFG/IFG\t9\t\u221237\t16\t30\t1.2\t\u2013\t0.0001???\t0.017\nPARIETAL\tPARIETAL\tPARIETAL\tPARIETAL\tPARIETAL\tPARIETAL\tPARIETAL\tPARIETAL\tPARIETAL\nL superior parietal\t7\t\u221230\t\u221254\t47\t1.8\t0.0001\t0.03???\t\u2013\nL precuneus, cuneus\t7,19\t\u221225\t\u221271\t29\t4.4\t0.0001\t\u2013\t\u2013\nR precuneus, superior parietal\t7\t26\t\u221252\t46\t3.5\t0.0001\t\u2013\t\u2013\nTEMPORAL\u2013OCCIPITAL\tTEMPORAL\u2013OCCIPITAL\tTEMPORAL\u2013OCCIPITAL\tTEMPORAL\u2013OCCIPITAL\tTEMPORAL\u2013OCCIPITAL\tTEMPORAL\u2013OCCIPITAL\tTEMPORAL\u2013OCCIPITAL\tTEMPORAL\u2013OCCIPITAL\tTEMPORAL\u2013OCCIPITAL\nL superior temporal, posterior insula\t13,22\t\u221247\t\u221227\t11\t19.7\t0.0001a\t\u2013\t0.0001\nR superior temporal, posterior insula\t13,22\t48\t\u221220\t10\t19.5\t0.0001???\t\u2013\t0.0001\nL parahippocampal gyrus\t37\t\u221222\t\u221247\t13\t2.3\t\u2013\t0.0001???\t\u2013\nL parahippocampus, hippocampus\t37\t\u221231\t\u221238\t\u22122\t0.9\t\u2013\t0.0001???\t\u2013\nR parahippocampal gyrus\t35,36\t27\t\u221227\t\u221212\t1.1\t0.008\t\u2013\t\u2013\nR middle temporal\t22\t32\t\u221254\t16\t1.0\t\u2013\t0.0001\t\u2013\nL middle occipital, parahippocampus\t18,19,36,37\t\u221235\t\u221262\t\u22124\t18.7\t0.0001\t0.007\t0.015\nR middle occipital, cuneus, parahippocampus\t17,18,36,37\t28\t\u221263\t\u22124\t24.6\t0.0001\t0.01\t0.036\nL middle occipital, cuneus\t17,18\t\u221217\t\u221289\t10\t12.8\t0.0001\t\u2013\t0.013\nR middle occipital, cuneus\t18,19\t28\t\u221278\t19\t12.0\t0.0001\t\u2013\t\u2013\nB cuneus\t18\t\u22124\t\u221277\t13\t3.1\t0.0001\t\u2013\t\u2013\nSUBCORTICAL\tSUBCORTICAL\tSUBCORTICAL\tSUBCORTICAL\tSUBCORTICAL\tSUBCORTICAL\tSUBCORTICAL\tSUBCORTICAL\tSUBCORTICAL\nL thalamus (pulvinar, LGB)\t\t\u221221\t\u221225\t\u22121\t0.7\t\u2013\t0.034\t\u2013\nB thalamus (pulvinar, red nucleus)\t\t1.4\t\u221220\t2\t0.7\t\u2013\t0.0001\t\u2013\nL claustrum\t\t\u221225\t\u221215\t18\t0.9\t\u2013\t0.0001\t\u2013\nL putamen\t\t\u221226\t\u22128\t10\t1.7\t\u2013\t0.0001\t\u2013\nR putamen, caudate body\t\t25\t\u22123\t8\t4.4\t\u2013\t0.0001\t\u2013\n### Caption\nRegions showing significant effects of modality, timing condition, and the interaction.\n### Footer\nBrodmann areas (BA) were defined by the Talairach and Tournoux atlas.

This bias is often accompanied by heightened amygdala activity in patients with BPD as compared to healthy controls. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies exploring differences between patients and healthy controls in facial emotion processing have produced divergent results. The current study explored fMRI and heart rate variability (HRV) correlates of negative facial emotion processing in patients with BPD and healthy controls. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe study included 30 patients with BPD (29 females; age: M\u2009=\u200924.22, SD\u2009=\u20095.22) and 30 healthy controls (29 females; M\u2009=\u200924.66, SD\u2009=\u20095.28). All participants underwent the \u201cfaces\u201d task, an emotional face perception task, in an fMRI session simultaneously with ECG. In this task, participants are presented with emotional expressions of disgust, sadness, and fear (as a negative condition) and with the same pictures in a scrambled version (as a neutral condition). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe found no differences in brain activity between patients with BPD and healthy controls when processing negative facial expressions as compared to neutral condition. We observed activation in large-scale brain areas in both groups when presented with negative facial expressions as compared to neutral condition. Patients with BPD displayed lower HRV than healthy controls in both conditions. However, there were no significant associations between HRV and amygdala activity and BPD symptoms. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe results of this study indicate no abnormal brain activity during emotional facial processing in patients with BPD. This result contrasts with previous studies and more studies are needed to clarify the relationship between facial emotion processing and brain activity in patients with BPD. Possible reasons for the absence of brain activity differences are discussed in the study. Consistent with previous findings, patients showed lower HRV than healthy controls. However, HRV was not associated with amygdala activity and BPD symptoms. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nEmotional dysregulation, usually described as an inability to control and regulate one\u2019s affective state, is one of the core features in borderline personality disorder (BPD) [ ]. It is linked with difficulties in the personal experience of emotion and with the perception of emotion in others [ ,  ]. Given that facial expressions are fundamental emotional stimuli for everyday social functioning [ ], biased processing of emotional faces in patients with BPD may lead to frequently observed maladaptive behaviors and interpersonal problems, including loneliness, conflictual relationships, and fear of abandonment. \n\nMitchell et al. [ ] reviewed 25 studies (  N  \u2009=\u20091279) exploring differences in facial emotion processing between patients with BPD and healthy controls (HC). They found conclusive evidence of a tendency in patients to interpret ambiguous and neutral expressions as negative expressions. However, the findings for negative and positive expressions have been divergent. Whereas some studies found impaired accuracy in recognizing a wide range of negative expressions [ ], others found impairment only for specific expressions such as fear or disgust [ \u2013 ] or no impairment at all [ ,  ]. Furthermore, no recognition difficulties were found in full-intensity happy expressions [ ]. Patients were more accurate in recognizing happy faces than angry, sad, and neutral faces and displayed even greater accuracy than HC [ ,  ]. \n\nProcessing emotional expressions requires diverse psychological effort driven by multiple neural structures [ ]. Fusar-Poli et al. [ ] conducted a meta-analysis on 105 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies exploring the neural correlates of human facial expression processing in healthy respondents (  N  \u2009=\u20091600). They found increased activation of various visual areas (fusiform gyrus, inferior and middle occipital gyri), limbic areas (amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus), temporal areas (middle and superior temporal gyrus), temporoparietal areas (parietal lobule, middle temporal gyrus, insula), prefrontal areas (medial frontal gyrus), and in the putamen and cerebellum. Although the specific interactions between these areas have not been clarified, it is hypothesized that the initial perceptual processing of faces occurs in the occipital and temporal lobes, which construct detailed representations from facial features. Subsequently, a set of brain areas, including the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, links the perceptual representation of the face to the meaning of the signaled emotion [ ]. The amygdala is a crucial brain area associated with BPD symptoms, and studies often report its hyperactivity during emotional processing in patients [ ]. Its activity may also be altered during the processing of facial expressions. \n\nRecently, there has been an increase in fMRI studies exploring brain activity differences in patients with BPD. The review by Mitchell et al. [ ] also described the differences in neural activation during facial processing between HC and patients with BPD. Heightened activity of the left and right amygdala in patients during the presentation of facial stimuli was found across studies. Specifically, patients with BPD exhibited increased amygdala activity in response to neutral stimuli and heightened amygdala activity in response to fear. A later study by Wrege et al. [ ] presented images of faces with neutral and moderately fearful expressions (50%) or intensively (100%) fearful expressions to 39 patients with BPD and 25 HC. Besides higher amygdala activation, the results revealed higher activations when viewing neutral faces (neutral faces > fixation cross) in the right temporal pole, hippocampus, pallidum, and orbitofrontal cortex in the patients with BPD as compared with the HC. There were no group differences in whole-brain activation when viewing fearful facial expressions of both intensities (moderately fearful faces > fixation cross; intensively fearful faces > fixation cross). However, the region of interest (ROI) analysis (intensively fearful > neutral; moderately fearful > neutral faces) focused on the amygdala and hippocampus revealed higher bilateral amygdala and right hippocampus activity in response to moderately fearful expressions in patients with BPD as compared with HC. Lamers et al. [ ] showed patients with BPD (  N  \u2009=\u200920) and HC respondents only fearful faces stimuli. During this task, the patients with BPD showed hyperactivation of the frontostriatal, posterior cingulate cortex, and posterior parietal brain areas compared to HC (negative > neutral faces). ROI analysis also suggested higher activation in the emotion regulation network (amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex; ACC, insula, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) in the patients with BPD (negative > neutral faces) when compared to HC. \n\nAs for other negative emotions, Donegan et al. [ ] presented patients with BPD (  N  \u2009=\u200915) and HC with sad facial expressions. They found heightened left amygdala activity in response to sadness (sad faces > fixation point) in patients with BPD as compared with HC. Another study by Minzenberg et al. [ ] used angry expressions in a sample of patients with BPD (  N  \u2009=\u200912) and HC. In comparison to HC, the patients exhibited less activity in the bilateral amygdala, but more activity in the bilateral rostral ACC in response to angry expressions (anger > neutral faces). Baskin-Sommers et al. [ ] also presented respondents (N \u2009=\u200913) with angry expressions. In this study, patients with BPD demonstrated higher activity in response to anger in the left superior frontal gyrus (angry > neutral faces) relative to HC. \n\nNo unusual amygdala activity or typical patterns in brain activation were found regarding the processing of happy expressions in fMRI studies. Baskin-Sommers et al. [ ] (N \u2009=\u200913) found increased activity of the left inferior and decreased activity of the left superior frontal brain areas (happy > neutral faces); a more recent study by Lamers et al. [ ] (N \u2009=\u200922) did not replicate these findings. Besides the activity of temporal, limbic, and occipital areas in both groups, hyperactivation of the bilateral caudate was observed in the patients with BPD (happy > neutral faces). \n\nWith respect to the heterogeneous results of fMRI studies in this area, other methods might be useful to identify differences in facial processing between patients with BPD and healthy people. There has been increasing interest in heart rate variability (HRV) as a physiological marker of emotional stability and flexibility. HRV is the inconsistency of time intervals between individual heartbeats resulting from the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system [ ]. Alteration of HRV emerges from the loss of balance between these branches and the constant need of the heart to adapt to changing circumstances. High HRV is associated with better adaptation to environmental stressors and emotional stimuli, whereas low HRV is associated with emotional dysregulation and worse ability to control mental and behavioral impulses [ ,  ]. \n\nFluctuations of HRV (as an index of cerebral autonomic regulation) are associated with functional changes between and within brain regions included in the central autonomic network (CAN; prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, amygdala, periaqueductal gray, pons, and medulla) [ \u2013 ]. Although imaging studies have pointed out that changes in the neural activity of the amygdala, claustrum, thalamus, and hypothalamus contribute to HRV [ ,  ,  ], less is known about their relationship during emotion regulation and specifically facial emotion processing. Steinfurth et al. [ ] explored the relationship between habitual resting state vmHRV and neural activity during explicit emotion regulation in healthy controls (  N  \u2009=\u200924). The results showed an association between vmHRV and the activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala during emotion regulation of unpleasant emotions. The group with high vmHRV displayed modulated activation of the right amygdala during the reappraisal strategy, and the group with low vmHRV displayed modulated activation of the right amygdala only when using the response modulation strategy. Similarly, respondents with high vmHRV displayed increased activation of the right PFC when regulating unpleasant emotion with reappraisal, whereas low vmHRV respondents displayed the same activation of PFC when using response modulation. Based on these results, the author suggested that different levels of vmHRV are associated with different patterns of brain activity during emotion regulation. A later study by Miller et al. [ ] assessed neural activity and resting HRV while observing and imitating emotional faces in healthy respondents (  N  \u2009=\u200941). They found negative correlation between resting HRV and activation in the mirror neuron system, insula, and amygdala during observation, but not the imitation of emotional faces. Thus, the results supported the idea, that resting HRV is linked to neural sensitivity to other\u2019s emotional cues, such as facial expressions. \n\nOnly a few studies have explored the alteration of HRV in patients with BPD. Koenig et al. [ ] performed a meta-analysis on five studies (  N  \u2009=\u2009200) focused on vagally-mediated HRV (vmHRV) in patients with BPD and HC. Results revealed lower vmHRV in patients with BPD relative to HC in resting state. Later studies found a significant relation between reduced HRV and greater BPD symptom severity together with worsened psychosocial functioning and higher emotional dysregulation, negative affective state, and depressive symptomatology [ \u2013 ]. Therefore, differences associated with emotional dysregulation between patients with BPD and HC may be apparent in HRV. \n\nTo our knowledge, there has not yet been a study reporting HRV in patients with BPD during facial emotion processing. However, Mai\u00df et al. [ ] explored HRV during the approach-avoidance task (AAT) in 42 patients with BPD. In this task, respondents are presented with happy and angry expressions and must pull or push these pictures according to their reaction. The results indicated a relationship between low HRV and an attenuated approach to angry faces with an averted gaze, suggesting that patients have a tendency to avoid this facial expression. \n\nTo summarize, patients with BPD are consistently reported to show deficits in processing neutral or ambiguous facial expressions, which they tend to interpret as negative. This bias is usually accompanied by higher amygdala activity in fMRI studies. However, the findings of fMRI studies regarding facial processing of other emotional valence have been inconsistent. Some studies found heightened left amygdala activity in patients with BPD in response to sad expressions [ ]; others found lowered bilateral amygdala activity and heightened activity of the bilateral rostral ACC or left superior frontal gyrus in response to angry expressions [ ,  ]. In this study, we explored fMRI and HRV correlates of processing facial expressions with negative valence since patients often experience difficulties in negative social situations. For this purpose, we used the \u201cfaces\u201d task [ ]. All respondents were presented with negative facial expressions (disgust, sadness, and fear) and with scrambled pictures as a control condition during fMRI with simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) measurement. We did not use neutral expressions as a control condition because there is evidence of altered neural activation while viewing neutral faces in patients with BPD as compared to HC; this could diminish the activation differences associated with negative facial stimuli [ ]. We used self-report questionnaires to assess fundamental symptoms of BPD (emotional dysregulation, rejection sensitivity, dissociation, and childhood trauma) that might affect emotional experiences during face processing in patients with BPD. We hypothesized that there are differences in neural activity between patients with BPD and HC while processing negative faces as compared to during a control condition. Based on previous studies, we specifically expected higher amygdala activity in the patients with BPD. We presumed that patients with BPD exhibit lower HRV than HC while viewing negative faces based on the previously found relationship of low HRV with emotional dysregulation. Lastly, in accordance with our previous suggestions, we expected higher amygdala activity to be associated with lower HRV during the processing of facial expressions in BPD patients. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study was part of more extensive research exploring the neural mechanisms of dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) in patients with BPD. The research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Boards of the Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, and University Hospital Brno. \n\nThe current study was conducted before DBT treatment. We included 30 patients with BPD (29 females) and 30 matched HC (29 females). Patients with BPD were recruited from outpatient treatment at the Department of Psychiatry of the University Hospital Brno. Inclusion criteria were: 1) at least five out of the nine DSM-V criteria for BPD and 2) one or more suicide attempts and/or non-suicidal self-injury episodes in the past 6 months. Exclusion criteria were psychotic disorder, severe neurological disorder, or any contraindication to fMRI scanning. HC were recruited via social media advertisements. They were matched with patients in age (same age +/\u2212 2 years), gender, and education (same level +/\u2212 one level). Educational levels were primary school, lower secondary, higher secondary, and university. Healthy controls had no current or lifetime psychiatric diagnosis. \n\nMost patients (90%) also met the criteria for other psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) (50%), social anxiety disorder (33.3%), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (23.3%), substance use disorder (alcohol\u2009=\u200936.7%; drugs\u2009=\u200916.7%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (13.3%), and panic disorder (13.3%). We also included medicated patients (83.3%). All participants were instructed not to take any sedative medication 24\u2009hours before the fMRI session. They were allowed to take their other prescribed medication, consisting mainly of antidepressants and antipsychotics. \n\nSince medication may alter neural activity [ ,  ] we made a medication index to assess the possible effects of patient medication on neural activity. The medication index was made as an ordinary scale of medication according to Barte\u010dk\u016f et al. [ ]: 0\u2009=\u2009no medication, 1\u2009=\u2009one or more drugs at lower than the therapeutic dose, 2\u2009=\u2009one drug at the therapeutic dose, 3\u2009=\u2009more drugs with one at the therapeutic dose, 4\u2009=\u2009more drugs at the therapeutic dose. Since major depressive disorder is one of the most common conditions that occur alongside BPD [ ] and most prescribed medication in BPD patients includes antidepressants and antipsychotics [ ,  ], we chose therapeutic doses of these two types of medication recommended for major depressive disorder. Therapeutic doses of antidepressants were specified according to the Antidepressant Treatment History Questionnaire (ATRQ; [ ]). Therapeutic doses of antipsychotics were determined according to Wang et al. [ ]. The medication index was then used as a covariate in statistical analyses. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nAll of the participants were informed about the study before the assessments and gave their written informed consent. On the first day, participants attended a semi-structured interview with a trained psychiatrist and completed self-report questionnaires on BPD symptoms. The next day, they performed three tasks during fMRI, starting with the \u201cfaces\u201d task. Then participants underwent the Neurofeedback task (assessing the emotion regulation ability) and the Cyberball task (assessing rejection sensitivity). The whole assessment took about two and a half hours. This study presents the fMRI data from the \u201cfaces\u201d task and its relation to the self-report questionnaires. Results from the Cyberball task in the same sample were published in L\u00e1talov\u00e1 et al. [ ] study. \n\n\n### Measurements \n  \nThe BPD diagnosis was assessed by a trained clinician using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V Personality Disorders [ ]. \n\nSelf-report questionnaires were used to assess the severity of BPD symptoms (Borderline Symptom List; BSL-23 [ ]; Czech version: [ ], emotional dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form; DERS-SF [ ]; Czech version: [ ], rejection sensitivity (Rejection Sensitivity RS-Adult questionnaire; A-RSQ [ ], and dissociation (Multiscale Dissociation Inventory; MDI [ ]. We also assessed childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire CTQ [ ]; Czech version: [ ]). Since there is no validated Czech version of the A-RSQ and MDI questionnaires, we translated these questionnaires using the back-translation method. \n\n\n### Experimental task \n  \nWe used the exact version of the \u201cfaces\u201d task according to Paret et al. [ ]. Participants viewed pictures of faces (12 actors and 12 actresses) with emotional expressions of disgust, sadness, and fear (negative condition; NgC) from the Warsaw Set of Emotional Facial Expression Pictures ( ), and the same pictures in a scrambled version (neutral condition; NC). In all, 72 emotional faces and 72 scrambled faces were used. The pictures were presented in 24 blocks (12 NgC and 12 NC), with the order pseudorandomized with maximally two identical conditions following each other. Every block consisted of a sequence of six faces, each presented for 3 seconds. Within each block, faces with different emotional expressions of different people occurred randomly. The inter-block interval included a fixation cross on a black background, lasting randomly between nine and 11 seconds. To maintain attention, we instructed respondents to press the left or right button according to the gender of the presented face (NgC) or the color of the frame around the picture (NC). \n\n\n### Functional and structural MRI acquisition and ECG \n  \nThe acquisition was performed on the Siemens Prisma 3\u2009T MR whole-body scanner with 64-channel head-neck coil. A high-resolution structural T1 image was scanned for each participant. This makes it possible to localize the active brain areas more accurately than using functional images only. Parameters of the MPRAGE sequence were 240 sagittal slices, repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20092300\u2009ms, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20092.34\u2009ms, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009256\u2009mm, flip angle\u2009=\u20098\u00b0, slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm). Functional blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) MR data were acquired in a single scanning session with a T2*-weighted multiecho multiband echo-planar imaging (ME MB EPI) sequence of 1250 scans (60 slices, TR\u2009=\u20091000\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200914, 34.63 and 55.26\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009200\u2009mm, flip angle\u2009=\u200950\u00b0, slice thickness\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009mm, MB factor\u2009=\u20095). TE values were chosen according to recommendations for ME EPI [ ], where the second echo was very close to the typical value of single echo acquisition. Simultaneously with the fMRI data, ECG and respiration were measured by Brain Products BrainAmp ExG MR system with 5\u2009kHz sampling frequency. Both signals were corrected for MR gradient artifacts [ ] in Brain Vision Analyzer 2 and then used for RETROICOR correction of fMRI data. Processed ECG signal was also used for HRV calculation. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Self-reported data \n  \nSelf-reported data were analyzed in IBM SPSS Statistic (Version 27) [ ]. Independent t-tests were performed to explore group differences in age and in self-report questionnaires. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess differences in the level of education between patients and HC. \n\n\n#### fMRI data pre-processing \n  \nAll scans were realigned first. The process was applied to middle echo scans when each middle echo scan was aligned to the first middle echo scan. Estimated translations and rotations were used in the realignment procedure of other echoes. RETROICOR technique [ ] suppressed any physiological noise originated in ECG and respiration in all scans. Information from all three echoes was used to create a composite scan using the contrast-to-noise weighted average. In each voxel, temporal SNR (tSNR) values were computed for each echo. The resulting voxel value was given by the weighted average of the three original tSNR-weighted values and echoes [ ,  ]. Composite functional scans were then coregistered to high resolution structural T1-weighted images and all data were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template. As a last step, the spatial smoothing of functional data was calculated by Gaussian filter with full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 5\u2009mm. \n\nThe data quality was checked for the presence of spatial abnormalities in Mask Explorer [ ] and for the presence of excessive movement in the movement_info tool ( ). The movement in the data was controlled by a framewise displacement (FD) measure [ ]. Data from all participants were eligible using the thresholds of 20% of scans exceeding FD\u2009=\u20090.5\u2009mm and 1% of scans exceeding FD\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009mm [ ]. \n\n\n#### fMRI data analysis \n  \nThe data were processed with SPM12 toolbox ( ) running under MATLAB R2021a [ ]. General linear modelling (GLM) was used to analyze the pre-processed data. \n\nAt first, the difference between NgC and NC condition and the comparison between BPD and HC group were examined. GLM was performed on the subject level, where the design matrix contained three time courses of visual stimuli timings convolved with canonical hemodynamic function and six confound regressors for movement (translations and rotations from realignment pre-processing procedure). The task was modelled as a block design, where three time courses represent the NgC blocks, the NC blocks, and the inter-block interval. First-level contrasts correspond to NgC and NC and their difference. \n\nIn the next step, group level GLM analysis was performed. We used a two-sample t-test to find the differences between patients with BPD and HC. Group results were evaluated at the cluster level inference with an initial cut-off of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 and cluster size larger than 20 and   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 with FWE correction on the cluster level. For the evaluation of the NgC and NC difference across all measured subjects one-sample t-test was used. The Xjview 10.0 toolbox was used to display results [ ]. \n\nTo assess the effect in the region of interest (ROI) only, the pipeline was the same as for the whole brain analysis. The amygdala region was selected based on masks created from automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas. The ROI representative was extracted as a mean of voxels assigned to the ROI. The extraction was performed on contrast estimates (NgC \u2013 NC). The medication effect was first shown using the medication index as a covariate in the group level GLM analyses. Then, statistical comparison between contrast estimates with and without medication was computed by paired t-test. For the analysis of amygdala habituation, the task regressors in the subject level GLM model were modulated by linear function, which characterizes the linear change of the effect over time. In the SPM model, the specifications of the first order time modulation were selected for task regressors. Time modulation of regressors allows for the characterization of nonstationary responses, e.g., habituation. We modeled linear effect/linear change of heights in regressors over time. This approach was used, for example, in Peters et al. [ ]. The advantage lies in using all scans in one model, which provides a better signal-to-noise input into the model than comparing the average BOLD signal from 18\u2009seconds of first and last blocks. Random order of the blocks (with max 2 repetitions consequently) also didn\u2019t allow to split each subject data into two parts of the same length. \n\nCorrelation analyses were conducted to examine associations between amygdala activity, specifically, HRV, and BPD symptoms. \n\n\n#### Heart rate variability \n  \nECG data were preprocessed in the BrainVision Analyzer 2 [ ]. MR gradient artifacts were suppressed by a subtraction approach [ ]. The data were resampled to a 250\u2009Hz sampling rate and filtered with the Butterworth zero phase low pass filter with a cut-off at 40\u2009Hz. Then, R waves were detected by a template matching procedure and manually checked with a visual inspection. \n\nThe standard deviation of heart rate values was computed in the NgC blocks as the heart rate variability (HRV) parameter. The comparison between the patients with BPD and HC groups were calculated using a Wilcoxon rank sum test in MATLAB R2021a. Correlation analyses were conducted to examine associations between HRV and BPD symptoms. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe results of the independent t-test showed no significant differences between BPD and HC groups in age. Significant between-group differences were found in BSL-23, A-RSQ, DERS-SF, MDI, and CTQ scores. In all questionnaires, patients with BPD had significantly higher scores than HC. A Mann-Whitney U test suggested a significant difference in education. Details are presented in Table  . Since there was a significant difference in educational level between groups, the possible effect of education on self-report questionnaires was explored by ANCOVA (using education as a covariate). Results showed no effect of education on differences between the groups in any of the self-report questionnaires.\n   \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample \n  \n BPD   borderline personality disorder,   HC   healthy control,   M   mean,   SD   standard deviation,   BSL-23   Borderline Symptom List,   A-RSQ   Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire,   DERS-SF   Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form,   MDI   Multiscale Dissociation Inventory,   CTQ   Childhood Trauma Questionnaire \n  \n\n### fMRI results \n  \nThe between-group comparison did not show any significant whole-brain differences between patients with BPD and HC in the NgC contrasted to the NC. Further, we performed a region of interest (ROI) analysis focused on the differences between groups specifically in the amygdala. The ROI analysis revealed no significant differences between patients and controls in amygdala activation. \n\nAs we identified no differences in fMRI between the groups, we compared the task conditions on the whole sample. The cluster-level whole-brain analysis identified eight large clusters in the NgC contrasted to NC condition (contrast NgC minus NC). Clusters had activation peaks in the cerebellum posterior lobe, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, medial frontal gyrus, putamen, superior and frontal gyrus, precuneus, and cingulate gyrus (Fig.  ). A detailed description of clusters is provided in Table  .   \nActivation map showing areas with higher activation during negative facial processing in all subjects (patients with BPD and HC\u00a0together).

Results showed no significant differences. \n\n\n### Additional analyses \n  \n#### Medication effect \n  \nThe results showed no significant differences between contrast estimates (NgC minus NC) with and without medication (Fig.  ).   \nResults of the comparison of contrast estimates (NgC minus NC) with and without medication \n  \n\n\n#### Amygdala habituation \n  \nSome authors have suggested that it might not be that the average amygdala activity is impaired in patients with BPD during emotional stimuli, but rather that patients with BPD show lower habituation on emotional stimuli as compared with HC [ ,  ]. Since we did not find differences in amygdala activity between the groups, we also explored differences in amygdala habituation. The group comparison results did not show differences in amygdala habituation between the patients with BPD and HC (t\u2009=\u20094.55; p \u2009=\u2009.47). \n\n\n\n### Heart rate variability results \n  \nThe results showed significantly lower HRV in patients with BPD than in HC (  p  \u2009=\u2009.004;   r  \u2009=\u2009.35) in NgC condition, as illustrated in Fig.  . HRV was significantly lower in patients also in NC condition (  p  \u2009=\u2009.003,   r  \u2009=\u2009.35). No differences were found within-groups in NgC versus NC condition (BPD group:   p  \u2009=\u2009.70;   r  \u2009=\u2009.007; HC group:   p  \u2009=\u2009.52;   r  \u2009=\u2009.03). \n\n  \nDifferences between patients with BPD and HC during the NgC (  p  \u2009=\u2009.004;   r  \u2009=\u2009.35) and NC (  p  \u2009=\u2009.003;   r  \u2009=\u2009.35) condition \n  \n\n\n### Correlation analyses \n  \n#### Amygdala activity and HRV \n  \nNo significant correlations were found between the left amygdala and HRV (  r  \u2009=\u2009.12,   p  \u2009=\u2009.53) and the right amygdala and HRV (  r  \u2009=\u2009.11,   p  \u2009=\u2009.56) in BPD patients. No significant correlations were found between the left amygdala and HRV (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.01,   p  \u2009=\u2009.95) and the right amygdala and HRV (  r  \u2009=\u2009.09,   p  \u2009=\u2009.65) in healthy controls. \n\n\n#### Amygdala activity and self-report questionnaires \n  \nSince no differences were found in amygdala activity between groups, correlations were performed on the whole sample. No significant correlations were found between the left amygdala activity and BSL-23 (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.08;   p  \u2009=\u2009.54), A-RSQ (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.07;   p  \u2009=\u2009.58), MDI (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.07;   p  \u2009=\u2009.55), DERS-SF (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212 .03;   p  \u2009=\u2009.79), or CTQ (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212 .06;   p  \u2009=\u2009.61) scores. No significant correlations were found between the right amygdala activity and BSL-23 (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.20;   p  \u2009=\u2009.11), A-RSQ (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212 .02;   p  \u2009=\u2009.87), MDI (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.13;   p  \u2009=\u2009.31), or DERS-SF (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.13;   p  \u2009=\u2009.32) scores. \n\n\n#### Heart rate variability and self-report questionnaires \n  \nNo significant correlations were found between HRV and BSL-23 (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.15;   p  \u2009=\u2009.43), A-RSQ (  r  \u2009=\u2009.15;   p  \u2009=\u2009.43), MDI (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.19;   p  \u2009=\u2009.31), DERS-SF (  r  \u2009=\u2009.33;   p  \u2009=\u2009.09), and CTQ (  r  \u2009=\u2009.04;   p  \u2009=\u2009.81) scores in patients with BPD. As well in HC, no significant correlations were found between HRV and BSL-23 (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.00;   p  \u2009=\u2009.99), A-RSQ (  r  \u2009=\u2009.08;   p  \u2009=\u2009.67), MDI (  r  \u2009=\u2009.24;   p  \u2009=\u2009.22), DERS-SF (  r  \u2009=\u2009\u2212.04;   p  \u2009=\u2009.83), or CTQ (  r  \u2009=\u2009.17;   p  \u2009=\u2009.38). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current study explored fMRI and HRV correlates of negative emotional facial processing in patients with BPD and HC. We found large scale activation across the brain in the whole sample while processing negative facial expressions as compared to the control condition (scrambled pictures). Contrary to our hypotheses, we found no significant differences between patients with BPD and HC in neural activity nor higher amygdala activity specifically in patients with BPD as compared with HC when processing negative facial expressions as compared to the control condition. Moreover, amygdala activity was unrelated to BPD symptom severity. The results suggest no abnormal BOLD activity during negative emotional facial processing in patients with BPD. Further, patients with BPD displayed lower HRV as compared with HC, regardless of condition type. However, there was no significant association between HRV and BPD symptoms, rejection to sensitivity, dissociation, emotional dysregulation, and childhood trauma as measured by self-report questionnaires both in patients with BPD and HC. These findings indicate that low HRV may be associated with BPD, but it was unrelated to experimental condition and symptoms assessed in this study. \n\nIn the whole sample, we found heightened activity in the cerebellum posterior lobe, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, medial frontal gyrus, putamen, superior frontal gyrus, precuneus, and cingulate gyrus. Activity in the superior frontal gyrus, precuneus, hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, and medial frontal gyrus was also found in previous studies exploring brain activity during facial processing in HC and patients with BPD [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Thus, the \u201cfaces\u201d task seems a valid method for eliciting the activity of areas connected to facial emotion processing. However, differences between patients with BPD and HC were not detected by the \u201cfaces\u201d task in this study, although the differences in self-reported BPD symptoms between the groups were very high. \n\nSeveral factors may explain the discrepancy between our findings and previous findings regarding brain activity and mainly amygdala activity during facial processing in patients with BPD. Previous studies found amygdala hyperactivity in patients while viewing neutral and fearful expressions [ ,  ,  ]. In the current study, we presented respondents with mixed expressions of fear, disgust, and sadness. Wrege et al. [ ] pointed out that the neural substrates of emotion processing seem to be task-dependent and affected by the type of comparison. Thus, it is possible that combining negative expressions of different emotions might have diminished amygdala hyperactivity or brain differences between groups in general. Moreover, there seem to be fMRI correlates during facial expression experiencing other than the amygdala. For example, studies found heightened activity of the superior frontal gyrus [ ,  ,  ], medial frontal gyrus [ ,  ], hippocampus [ ,  ], and precuneus [ ,  ,  ]. Other studies did not find heightened amygdala activity [ ,  ]. It is possible that amygdala activity is heightened primarily in processing neutral or fearful expressions; therefore, various emotional valences should be explored separately. Moreover, altered brain activity to neutral faces in BPD is a stable finding [ ,  ]; using neutral faces as a control condition for comparing to negative faces might be therefore biased. It follows that the relationship between higher amygdala activity and processing negative facial expressions is not straightforward. \n\nAccording to some studies [ ,  ], differences between patients with BPD and HC in emotion processing are not connected to amygdala hyperactivity but rather to slower amygdala habituation in patients. Following this hypothesis, we also analyzed differences in amygdala habituation to investigate the possibility of this effect. However, we did not find significant differences in habituation, thus we can rule out this process in our study and support previous ideas. \n\nStudies by Frick et al. [ ] and Mier et al. [ ] that identified amygdala hyperactivity in patients with BPD during neutral and negative expressions used tasks in which the respondents were instructed to identify the presented facial emotion. Following the procedure from Paret et al. [ ], respondents in our task were instructed to identify gender on the facial pictures to maintain their attention while viewing the faces. It is possible that neural correlates identified in previous studies might have reflected the emotion recognition process, not only the emotional experience while viewing faces. However, further research is needed to explore how ways of maintaining attention may affect these tasks. We may speculate that passive viewing of emotional expression is insufficient to detect abnormalities in brain processing of emotional faces in patients with BPD, even though Donegan et al. [ ] found heightened amygdala activity even in this type of task. It is also possible that identifying gender on the face pictures might have diminished the power to detect differences between the groups. \n\nAnother possible influence in our study is patient medication. According to Schulze, Schmahl and Niedtfeld [ ], medication considerably influences neural activations of the left amygdala and hippocampus. In their study, medication-free patients displayed hyperresponsivity to negative stimuli compared to HC. However, no hyperresponsivity was found in patients with BPD currently taking various psychotropic medication. This suggestion was supported by a later study by Paret et al. [ ], in which a single dose of citalopram reduced bilateral amygdala activity while viewing negative affective expressions in the same task that was used in the current study. Since we included mostly medicated patients (83.3%) in our study, we analyzed the possible effect of medication. However, we did not find significant differences in neural activity with and without medication. Thus, we can rule out the effect of the medication on neural activity in this study. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the effect of the medication completely since we had one group with various kinds of medications and the second group without any medication. \n\nThis study\u2019s second focus was examining HRV differences during facial emotion processing. Compared to HC, patients exhibited lower HRV when viewing both negative expressions and scrambled pictures. This finding suggests that patients generally have a lower HRV compared to HC. However, we did not find a significant relationship between HRV and amygdala activity in the patient group. The absence of this relationship might be explained by no differences in amygdala activity between patients and healthy controls. Also, there was no relationship between HRV and BPD symptom severity, rejection sensitivity, dissociation, emotional dysregulation, or childhood trauma. This result contrasts with previous studies [ \u2013 ,  ,  ]. A possible explanation may lie in methodological differences. The studies that found a positive relationship between HRV and BPD measured HRV outside the fMRI, whereas we measured HRV in fMRI. Although we did not clarify the association between lower HRV and BPD symptoms, low HRV seems to be connected to a worsened ability to react to emotional stimuli [ \u2013 ] and it might underlie disturbed emotion processing in BPD. A possible explanation for why group differences were found in HRV and not in fMRI may lie in the RETROICOR preprocessing technique. This routinely used technique suppresses the variability associated with physiological noise in the context of fMRI data, including the heart pulsation. On the basis of the timing of R-waves in the ECG, basic functions are regressed from fMRI, which suppresses undesired physiological artifacts and enhances the signal-to-noise ratio [ ,  ]. In our case, a partial suppression of the desired effect might occur. In general, it seems appropriate to assess emotional dysregulation by various markers, including both fMRI and psychophysiological functions. According to our expectations, BPD patients have lower HRV in general. Although we still do not know what processes underlie lower HRV in patients, it was not task dependent in our study. \n\nSeveral limitations of this study should be discussed. As mentioned, we used the \u201cfaces\u201d task with a combination of negative expressions instead of focusing on one specific emotion. Presenting more than one emotion and quickly changing among several expressions may affect neural activity and diminish potential differences. Although this may be understood as a limitation, this \u201cfaces\u201d task design is diverse and complex, thus resembling social interactions in everyday life. \n\nBecause of our sample composition, we cannot generalize results to men. We also did not exclude patients with BPD with comorbid disorders. Therefore, we cannot reject the possibility that the absence of diversity in neural activity and lower HRV are associated with patient comorbidities. However, comorbid disorders are natural in patients with BPD. Moreover, most of our BPD patients were medicated, thus we cannot rule out the medication influence completely, and further studies could include a direct comparison of medicated and unmedicated patients. \n\nPrevious studies and reviews [ ,  ,  ] provided evidence about abnormal amygdala activity of patients with BPD during facial emotion processing. However, we did not find any differences in brain activity. The relationship between BPD symptoms and the amygdala seems more complex, and more research is needed. Future research should explore neural activity connected to specific emotional valence rather than multiple emotions. It is also necessary to clarify the role of medication in changing neural activity and comorbidity in HRV abnormality. Although low HRV seems connected to emotional instability and worsened ability to react to emotional stimuli [ \u2013 ], more studies are needed to better understand its relationship. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study exploring brain activity together with heart rate variability and their relationship during facial emotion processing in BPD patients. We did not find any differences between patients and healthy controls in brain activity, neither in amygdala, specifically. Further, there were no difference in amygdala habituation during the task between the groups. Although heightened amygdala activity is a frequently reported result, it seems that its connection to facial emotion processing is not straightforward, and future studies should explore its activity during specific emotional valence rather than multiple emotions. The results showed lower HRV in patients with BPD than in healthy controls, but HRV was not associated with BPD symptoms. Therefore, low HRV seems to be connected to the emotion dysregulation disorder, however its relationship to specific symptoms or functions needs to be clarified. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0_level_0\tBPD patients\tBPD patients\tHC\tHC\tBPD vs HC independent t-test\tBPD vs HC independent t-test\tBPD vs HC independent t-test\nUnnamed: 0_level_1\tN\u2009=\u200930\tN\u2009=\u200930\tN\u2009=\u200930\tN\u2009=\u200930\tBPD vs HC independent t-test\tBPD vs HC independent t-test\tBPD vs HC independent t-test\nUnnamed: 0_level_2\tM\tSD\tM\tSD\tT (df)\tp-value\tD\nAge\t24.2\t5.2\t24.7\t5.2\t- 0.3 (58)\t0.74\t5.2\nBSL-23\t51.7\t14.0\t5.7\t5.5\t16.7 (37.9)\t< .001\t10.6\nA-RSQ\t15.3\t4.8\t6.5\t2.8\t8.5 (58)\t<. 001\t4.0\nDERS-SF\t61.5\t7.3\t31.0\t6.6\t16.9 (58)\t<. 001\t6.9\nMDI\t72.2\t18.0\t38.4\t7.4\t9.5 (38.6)\t<. 001\t13.7\nCTQ\t58.1\t13.4\t32.3\t5.8\t9.5 (37.8)\t<. 001\t10.2\nEducation\tN\t\tN\t\tMann-Whitney U test\tMann-Whitney U test\tMann-Whitney U test\nEducation\tN\t\tN\t\tU\tp-value\tr\nPrimary\t6\t\t4\t\t310\t.025\t.031\nLower secondary\t4\t\t0\t\t\t\t\nHigher secondary\t16\t\t15\t\t\t\t\nUniversity\t4\t\t11\t\t\t\t\n### Caption\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample\n### Footer\nBPD borderline personality disorder, HC healthy control, M mean, SD standard deviation, BSL-23 Borderline Symptom List, A-RSQ Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire, DERS-SF Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form, MDI Multiscale Dissociation Inventory, CTQ Childhood Trauma Questionnaire\n\n\n## ID: Tab2\n### Label: Table 2\nAnatomic label\tSide L/R\tPeak MNI coordinate\tPeak MNI coordinate\tPeak MNI coordinate\tPeak intensity (t)\tCluster size\tPFWE-cor\nAnatomic label\tSide L/R\tX\tY\tZ\tPeak intensity (t)\tCluster size\tPFWE-cor\nCerebellum posterior lobe\tL\t\u22123\t\u221258\t\u221244\t8.92\t168\t<.001\nCerebellum posterior lobe\tL\t\u221215\t\u2212\u200982\t\u221241\t10.57\t158\t<.001\nHippocampus, thalamus, amygdala\tR\t27\t\u22121\t\u221220\t21.07\t6156\t<.001\nCerebellum posterior lobe\tR\t24\t\u221282\t\u221235\t8.3\t119\t<.001\nMedial frontal gyrus\tMedial\t0\t47\t\u221217\t12.39\t234\t<.001\nPutamen\tL\t\u221212\t11\t4\t7.44\t44\t<.001\nSuperior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus\tR\t9\t59\t28\t9.67\t552\t<.001\nPrecuneus, cingulate gyrus\tR\t3\t\u221258\t34\t10.71\t268\t<.001\n### Caption\nfMRI whole-brain results associated with negative facial expression processing as compared to scrambled pictures (contrast NgC minus NC) in all respondents.

The functional A/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs324981 in the neuropeptide S receptor gene (  NPSR1  ) has repeatedly been associated with panic disorder and might partly drive function respectively dysfunction of the neural \u201cfear network\u201d.

It consists of neutral and agoraphobia-specific pictures, half of the pictures were cued to induce anticipatory anxiety. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nRisk allele carriers showed significantly higher amygdala activation during the perception of agoraphobia-specific stimuli than A/A homozygotes. A linear group x genotype interaction during the perception of agoraphobia-specific stimuli showed a strong trend towards significance. Patients with the one or two T alleles displayed the highest and HC with the A/A genotype the lowest activation in the inferior orbitofrontal cortex (iOFC). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe study demonstrates an association of the   NPSR1  rs324981 genotype and the perception of agoraphobia-specific stimuli. These results support the assumption of a fronto-limbic dysfunction as an intermediate phenotype of PD/AG. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPanic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG) is one of the most common anxiety disorders with a 12-month prevalence of 2% ( ). This disorder is characterized by panic attacks, avoidance behavior or anticipatory anxiety in or before situations in which an escape would be impossible or embarrassing. These situations include, among others, public transportation, crowds or using an elevator ( ). Some brain areas which are involved in the processing of anxiety in PD and PD/AG have been identified. The amygdala plays a pivotal role in the so-called \u201cfear network\u201d and fMRI studies prove increased amygdala activation during the perception of anxiety related stimuli ( ;  ). Furthermore, the amygdala is engaged in adaptive and detrimental threat responding and the encoding of affective value of stimuli ( ;  ). Patients with PD/AG exhibited not only altered subcortical, but also altered cortical activation patterns. Aside from the amygdala, there are the brainstem, the hippocampus, the insula, the anterior cingulum and different temporal and prefrontal structures which make up the fear network ( ;  ). Although there is no agreement on the exact prefrontal structures involved, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), the inferior frontal gyrus and the orbito frontal cortex (OFC) are discussed as central structures ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). It is not certain to what extent these alterations in brain responses are valid for PD/AG, because many studies did not report the possible comorbidity of agoraphobia ( ). \n\nBased on the fact of a moderate to high heritability of PD/AG ( ), genetic risk factors are assumed to modulate the activation of the neural fear circuit. The neuropeptide S receptor gene (  NPSR1)   is an often discussed gene in matters of PD/AG. Neuropeptide S is a neurotransmitter, expressed in the brainstem and its m-RNA occurs in some regions of the fear circuit, like the amygdala, hypothalamus and cortex. It operates as a neuromodulator, especially in the onset of anxiety and arousal ( ). The   NPSR1   gene is localized on chromosome 7p14.3 and exhibits an A/T SNP (rs324981) leading to an amino acid exchange on position 107 (Asn Ile) ( ;  ). The more active T allele increases the NPS binding affinity to the receptor about tenfold ( ). The T allele is associated with panic disorder and elevated heart rate, increased response inhibition and error monitoring ( ;  ;  ;  ). Additionally, this allele is associated with a higher level of anxiety sensitivity in women with panic disorder and healthy T/T homozygotes showed an interaction with childhood maltreatment, leading to a higher anxiety sensitivity score ( ;  ).   reported a modulation of the amygdala reaction to fear-relevant faces by the   NPSR1   SNP. PD patients carrying the T allele showed a disrupted cortico-limbic connectivity with an increased activation of the amygdala, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) ( ). Healthy A/A homozygotes exhibited a stronger prefrontal activity in an emotional Stroop task and likewise T allele carriers had a higher responsiveness of the dlPFC and medial prefrontal cortex in a working memory task ( ;  ). In an executive control task, participants with the T/T genotype showed increased activation in the inferior and middle frontal gyrus ( ) and different developmental trajectories of fronto-limbic connectivity, dependent on   NPSR1   genotype, have been suggested during adolescence ( ). \n\nTaken together, there is converging evidence for the   NPSR1   T allele being a risk factor for anxiety related behavior, traits or neural activation patterns. To specifically and for the first time study the assumed relationship between genetic variation and a dysfunctional cortico-limbic network in PD with AG, a disorder-specific fMRI task was selected ( ). Healthy volunteers and patients with PD/AG, (grouped by the   NPSR1   risk allele), had to differentiate during the anticipation and perception between agoraphobia-specific and neutral pictures. Neuroimaging studies in other anxiety disorders ( ;  ) reported an increased prefrontal activation during the anticipation of fearful stimuli, whereas in PD/AG higher activation in the ventral striatum and insula were observed, so far ( ,  ). During the perception of fearful stimuli, changes in the amygdala activation were detected most frequently in different anxiety disorders ( ;  ;  ;  ). Based on previous evidence, the amygdala and the iOFC were chosen as volumes of interest of the neural fear circuit as an a priori hypothesis ( ;  ;  ). We expected that a successful fear regulation, in terms of a functional fronto-limbic network, is characterized by a higher frontal activation during the anticipation of agoraphobic pictures and a lower activation of the amygdala during the perception of those pictures. \n\nFor the   anticipation phase  : a) Healthy controls were hypothesized to show greater activity of the iOFC than patients with PD/AG (main effect diagnosis). b) As a main   NPSR1   genotype effect, participants with the A/A genotype were assumed to show higher responsiveness than participants with one or two T alleles (A/A\u00a0>\u00a0T), due to a supposedly better top-down control. c) An exploratory linear interaction group x   NPSR1   genotype (HC A/A\u00a0>\u00a0HC T\u00a0>\u00a0PD/AG A/A\u00a0>\u00a0PD/AG T) was assumed. \n\nIn the   perception phase  , d) Patients were expected to show higher activity in the amygdala than HC as a main effect diagnosis. e) As a main NPSR1 genotype effect, participants with the T risk allele were hypothesized to exhibit a stronger amygdala activity than participants with the A/A genotype (T\u00a0>\u00a0A/A). f) An exploratory linear interaction of group x   NPSR1   genotype (PD/AG T\u00a0>\u00a0PD/AG A\u00a0>\u00a0HC T\u00a0>\u00a0HC A/A) in the amygdala was assumed. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study was part of the multicenter trial \u201cMechanisms of action in CBT (MAC)\u201d and experimental add-on studies. The participating fMRI-Centers Aachen, Berlin, Dresden and M\u00fcnster recruited 89 patients in the first funding period, who met the criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia (DSM-IV-TR) and matched healthy controls (without any mental disorder). Due to quality controls and missing data, 62 patients and 39 healthy controls (HC) were included in the present study. In the second funding period: \u201cNeural correlates of panic disorder\u201d the participating fMRI-Centers Berlin and Dresden recruited 113 patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia and 99 HC. Data from 60 patients and 38 HC met above defined quality criteria and were included. A flowchart (Figs. S1 and S2) with patient and HC numbers and an explanation of the in- and exclusion criteria can be found in the supplemental information. All 121 patients and 77 HC were of Caucasian decent and underwent an extensive psychological and clinical diagnostic process, consisting of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview ( ), neuropsychological tests and a short medical examination. More than a third of the patients (45) suffered from one or more comorbid diagnoses, like nicotine dependence, depressive disorders or another anxiety disorder. In addition, clinical tests were completed by patients and the control group. Anxiety sensitivity was measured with the German version of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI, ( )). A detailed description of the diagnostic procedure is added in the supplementary material. All participants were right-handed and comparable in gender, age, smoking status and education ( ). Patients and controls enrolled in this study gave their written informed consent, which conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. The funding periods were approved by the Ethics Committees of the Medical Faculty of the Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden (EK 164082006), the Medical Faculty of the Philipps-University Marburg, Germany (Project no. 171/09) and by the ethics committees of all participating sites.   \nSociodemographic and clinical data. \n  Table 1       \n\n\n### Genotyping \n  \nDNA isolations and genotyping for the functional neuropeptide S receptor (  NPSR1  ) A/T variant (rs324981) were conducted at the Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, at the University Hospital of W\u00fcrzburg, according to published protocols ( ,  ). Genotypes were determined by investigators blinded for phenotypes and independently by two investigators. In both groups,   NPSR1   genotype distribution (PD/AG: AA\u00a0=\u00a0=31, 15.7%; AT\u202f=\u202f63, 31.8%: TT\u00a0=\u00a0=27, 13.6%,   p   (Exact)\u202f=\u202f0.72; HC: AA\u202f=\u202f19, 9.6%; AT\u202f=\u202f39, 19.7%: TT\u202f=\u202f19, 9.6%,   p   (Exact)\u202f=\u202f1.0) did not significantly differ from the expected numbers calculated according to the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium, using the program DeFinetti provided as an online source ( ; Wienker TF and Strom TM). \n\n\n### Self-report data and statistical analyses \n  \nTo assess group differences between patients with PD/AG and healthy controls, as well as differences between the genotype variations, self-report data and clinical data were analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics 19. To compare patients and HC by demographical data including sex, handedness, smoking status and years of education, \u00a0  \u03c7\u00b2-  tests were used. Variances in clinical questionnaires and tests between the PD/AG group and HC and between the different genotype groups were examined with a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni-corrected t-tests. The picture ratings were analyzed in an analogous manner. \n\nWe carried out a post hoc statistical power analysis to calculate the achieved power to detect main or interaction effects using G* Power 3.1.9.4 (Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany;  ). Power analysis indicated an 88% chance of detecting a small effect size (  f  \u202f=\u202f0.25) between the four groups as significant at the 5% level (two tailed) and   n  \u202f=\u202f198. \n\n\n### fMRI: experimental design, data acquisition and analyses \n  \nBoth groups performed the Westphal-Paradigm ( ,  ), which is composed of 48 agoraphobia-related (e.g., scenes of subways, crowds) and 48 neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System ( ). The pictures were presented randomly to produce reciprocal emotions and anxiety specific brain activation (supplemental material Fig. S3). Half of the pictures were cued by the words \u201cpanic\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d and the other half with a non-specific letter combination \u201cDGHNTFJ\u201d. Each picture was presented 2000\u00a0ms and each cue 250\u00a0ms. The stimuli were separated by the presentation of a fixation cross (variable period of 2\u20134\u00a0s) with the objective of minimizing eye movements. The duration of the inter-trial intervals varied between 2 and 6\u00a0s. The participants were instructed to pay attention to the picture content, to imagine being in the shown situation and to confirm each presentation of a picture with a button press. All pictures were rated related to agoraphobic anxiety after the fMRI scan. \n\nThe functional imaging of the MAC study was performed at four sites: Berlin (3-T General Electric Healthcare), Dresden (3-T Siemens Trio), M\u00fcnster (3-T Philips Achieva) and Aachen (3-T Philips Achieva). In the second trial phase, the participating fMRI sites Berlin and Dresden measured with a 3-T Siemens Trio. A table with the sample sizes per scanner can be found in the supplement (Table S1). The variety of scanners was controlled by using corresponding dummy variables as covariates in the statistical analyses. Functional images were collected using an echoplanar imaging (EPI) pulse (repetition time (TR)\u00a0=\u00a0=2\u00a0s, echotime (TE)\u202f=\u202f30\u00a0ms, matrix size\u00a0=\u00a0=64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064, voxel size\u00a0=\u00a0=3.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.8, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a0=90\u00b0) to reduce data loss and artifacts at all sites. 446 volumes were acquired with thirty slices positioned parallel to the anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure (AC\u2013PC). \n\nStatistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 8,  ) was used for the data analysis. All functional images were slice-time corrected, realigned to the individual mean EPI, spatially normalized to the standard EPI template and spatially smoothed with 8\u00a0mm full width at half-maximum during the preprocessing. On the first level, a single-subject statistic was conducted and two contrast images were computed and taken to the second level. For the anticipation phase the contrast: \u201cpanic cue minus neutral cue\u201d and for the picture perception phase the contrast: \u201call panic pictures minus all neutral pictures\u201c were created. On the group level, for each of the two contrasts (anticipation and perception) separate full factorial design ANOVAs with the factors group (PD/AG vs. HC) and grouped   NPSR1   genotype (AT/TT vs. A/A) and the covariate site were used. We tested   NPSR1   genotype effects using an F-contrast comparing the risk allele carriers and non-risk allele carriers in PD/AG and HC. Furthermore, the diagnosis by genotype interaction was tested in order to assess differences in genotype effects between both groups. Significant results were followed up with appropriate Bonferroni-corrected   t  -tests. In an explorative analysis, a linear effect over both groups was tested and corrected for multiple comparisons using small volume correction. Specifically, we assumed that existence of the T risk allele would lead to higher activation in both groups and that this effect would be higher in patients than in controls using the contrast [2 1 -1 -2]. \n\nWith regard to the a priori hypotheses, the amygdala and the inferior orbitofrontal cortex were defined as volumes of interest (VOI) in the anticipation and the perception phase. A small volume correction (SVC) was applied to the amygdala and iOFC VOIs, which was generated using the AAL- Atlas ( ) within the WFU Pick Atlas software toolbox ( ) voxel-level threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05. Outside these VOIs we applied a whole brain threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001. Associations between the neural activation (using mean parameter estimates extracted from the VOIs) and ASI respectively NEO-FFI scores were computed for each of the four groups using Bonferroni-corrected Pearson's correlations within SPSS. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Self-report data \n  \nThe patient group differed significantly from healthy controls in all disorder-specific questionnaires and tests (see  ). There was a significant main effect of   NPSR1   genotype regarding in the ASI scores, with T allele carriers displaying higher scores than A/A homozygotes (  F  \u00a0=\u00a04.17,   p  \u202f=\u202f.043). The genotype x group interaction showed a tendency towards significance (  F  \u00a0=\u00a03.50,   p  \u202f=\u202f.063). The PD/AG group showed significantly higher scores than the HC group in the neuroticism subscale of the NEO-FFI (  F  =\u202f=\u202f19.005,   p  \u202f=\u202f<.001). There was a main effect of   NPSR1   regarding the conscientiousness subscale (  F  =\u202f=\u202f6.058,   p  \u202f=\u202f.015), with T allele carriers displaying higher means than A/A homozygotes. A significant genotype x group interaction was found regarding the neuroticism scale of the NEO-FFI (  F  \u202f=\u202f5.111,   p  \u202f=\u202f.026). This interaction showed that PD/AG patients with one or two T alleles had higher neuroticism scores than PD/AG patients homozygous for the A allele. In contrast, HC with the A/A genotype had higher scores on that scale than healthy risk allele carriers. The anxiety rating of the agoraphobic-specific and neutral pictures revealed a significant group and picture difference. Over all groups, the panic pictures were rated as more anxiety-inducing than the neutral pictures. However, the patients evaluated the agoraphobic-specific and the neutral pictures as more alarming than the HC (panic pictures:   F  \u202f=\u202f86.306,   p  \u00a0< .001, neutral pictures:   F  \u202f=\u202f8.457,   p  \u202f=\u202f.004). No influence of   NPSR1   genotype on these ratings was detected. \n\n\n### fMRI \n  \n#### Anticipation phase \n  \nIn the anticipation phase neither significant main effects nor a diagnosis by genotype interaction were observed in the a priori defined ROIs. In the exploratory whole brain analysis, we detected a main effect genotype in the medial superior frontal gyrus (  F  \u202f=\u202f18.29). This area is part of the anterior or medial PFC (BA10). The whole brain results are reported in the supplement (Table S2). \n\n\n#### Perception phase \n  \nDuring the perception of agoraphobic pictures, we observed a significant main effect of   NPSR1   genotype on the bilateral amygdala (  F  \u202f=\u202f15.65,   x  \u202f=\u202f27,   y  \u202f=\u202f2,   z  \u202f=\u202f-29,   p  =\u202f=\u202f.006; ). Across groups, participants with two A alleles displayed a significantly reduced activation in the bilateral amygdala compared to T carriers (  T  \u202f=\u202f3.95,   x  \u202f=\u202f27,   y  \u202f=\u202f2,   z  \u202f=\u202f\u221229,   p  \u202f=\u202f.006, see  ). Areas in the left lingual gyrus and in the right amygdala survived the exploratory whole-brain correction (Table S1). The NEO-FFI trait neuroticism was trendwise negatively correlated with the amygdala activity (  r  \u202f=\u202f\u22120.488,   p  \u202f=\u202f.068) in healthy controls carrying A/A genotype. In an exploratory approach, we tested the assumed linear interaction in the ROIs with the highest activation in the PD/AG group with one or two risk alleles and the lowest activation in HC homozygous for the A allele. This effect showed a strong trend towards significance in the bilateral iOFC (  T  \u202f=\u202f3.54,   x  \u202f=\u202f\u221251,   y  \u202f=\u202f23,   z  \u202f=\u202f\u221214,   p  \u202f=\u202f.054).   \nBrain activation in fMRI 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 Design Westphal-Paradigm.

Abbreviations: PT: patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia; HC: healthy controls T: T/T and A/T carriers; A/A: A/A homozygotes; iOFC: inferior orbitofrontal cortex \n  Fig 1   \n\nContrary to our expectations, no significant differences between patients and HC were found in the perception phase. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study aimed to explore the interaction between risk allele status of the   NPSR1  rs324981 variant and a disrupted cortico-limbic dysfunction in PD/AG. Using a disorder-specific task, the neural activation patterns of anticipation and perception of agoraphobia-specific stimuli were examined in patients with PD/AG and HC, as a function of   NPSR1   genotype. The main findings are a higher amygdala activation in risk allele carriers and a trendwise diagnosis x genotype interaction in the iOFC during the perception of agoraphobia-specific stimuli. Unlike initial expectations, no effects of genotype or diagnosis were obtained in the a priori defined ROIs of the fear network during the anticipation phase. Though, we detected a   NPSR1   genotype effect on the activation on a part of the medial PFC in the exploratory whole brain analyses. \n\nAs a first main result, during the perception of agoraphobia-specific pictures, participants with one or two risk alleles were observed to show increased bilateral amygdala activation, while A/A homozygotes displayed a reduced activation. The amygdala is an important interface in the neural fear circuit and is associated with the processing and transition of emotional information regarding its valence and affects related behavior ( ;  ;  ). In line with the present results, the amygdala has been proposed to be significantly more involved in the perception than in the anticipation of fear related objects ( ;  ). Also, the   NPSR1   T allele has previously been linked to a stronger amygdala activity, partly to a stronger amygdala activity in a gene x environment interaction ( ;  ). The reported results are thus in accordance with the current state of research and imply an association of the   NPSR1   risk allele on amygdala activation during the perception of agoraphobia-specific pictures. Furthermore, in HC homozygous for the A allele amygdala activation correlated trendwise negatively with the trait \u2018neuroticism\u2019. This result points to a possibly protective, i.e. resilience-increasing function of the A/A genotype, as described by  . \n\nAs a second main result, we detected a borderline significant diagnosis x   NPSR1   risk allele interaction during the perception phase in the iOFC. Patients with PD/AG showed a significantly higher activation than HC and within these groups, the activation decreased dependent on the genotype (T\u00a0>\u00a0A/A). We assumed, that the frontal activation would primarily be higher during the anticipation phase, not during the perception of agoraphobia-specific stimuli. It appears that the interaction of prefrontal and limbic areas could not be strictly be separated into anticipation and perception.   reported similar findings with activation alterations in the amygdala, insula, ACC and iOFC in a subgroup of patients with PD/AG before and after SS(N)RI treatment during the perception phase of the Westphal Paradigm. Furthermore, the trend in the group x   NPSR1   genotype interaction is in line with the findings by  , who showed a higher activation of the dlPFC and OFC during the processing of fearful faces in patients with at least one T allele. Such activations in prefrontal regions as the OFC have been linked to emotion regulation processes ( ;  ) and aforesaid activation patterns in the neural fear circuit could therefore be interpreted as attempts of a compensatory top-down control. However, in participants carrying the T risk allele, in particular patients with PD/AG, the down-regulation of the amygdala possibly might be insufficient or fail because of a disrupted connectivity between cortical and limbic areas. This latter hypothesis is supported by findings of a reduced effective fronto-limbic connectivity in healthy children and adolescents, with a higher risk of adolescent subjects with T/T genotype ( ). Furthermore, there is evidence for impaired emotion regulation in patients with PD or PD/AG associated with prefrontal activity ( ;  ), also specifically in a panic disorder-specific paradigm, similar to the Westphal-Paradigm ( ). Altogether, the scope of this finding is limited due to its exploratory nature and the less conservative correction for multiple comparisons. \n\nThe third main result is that, against our hypotheses, no main or interaction effects were observed in the anticipation phase in the a priori defined ROIs. However, as an exploratory result, we detected a main effect of genotype in the whole brain analysis in the medial superior frontal gyrus, which is part of the anterior or medial PFC (BA10). This region is associated with emotion regulation and emotion action control and down-regulation of the amygdala ( ;  ;  ). More precisely, the medial PFC is associated with different neural activation patterns in patients with PD/AG respectively PD ( ;  ) and is linked to the   NPSR1   polymorphism ( ;  ). \n\nDespite the accordance of the present findings with the hypotheses deduced from the available literature, several limitations have to be considered. Sample size, especially the subgroup of A/A homozygous HC (  n  \u202f=\u202f19), were small to medium sized, therefore the degree to which these results can be generalized is limited. Also, the fact that the presently applied \u201cWestphal-Paradigm\u201d has to date uniquely been used in a patient sample recruited within two funding periods of a large German multi-site consortium does not allow for replication at this point, which limits the current candidate gene approach. Future studies could develop designs. Neither main results nor interaction effects were found during the anticipation phase. Expanded examination of the prefrontal areas might be helpful in further elucidating underlying mechanisms of this phase. More research is needed to examine the influence of the   NPSR1   polymorphism on prefrontal areas and top-down regulation. Opposite to the hypotheses, no group differences between patients with PD/AG and HC were detected in the examined ROIs. However, there was a group difference on the behavioral level in the rating of the agoraphobia-specific pictures. This inconsistency between neural and behavioral data could be due to the presentation duration of the stimuli. 2000\u00a0ms is, compared to other studies, a longer presentation duration, in which up- or down regulation processes could take place, which were not detected. Recent studies presented disorder-specific stimuli for a duration of 800\u00a0ms and showed stronger group main effects ( ;  ). For future research, a reduction of the demonstration time could be useful. Also a connectivity analysis to examine the supposed top-down regulation process while considering the   NPSR1   risk allele status would be helpful to understand the interaction of the different parts of the neural fear circuit. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn sum, the present results for the first time indicate a link between   NPSR1  rs324981 genotype and neural processing of agoraphobia-related stimuli underlying PD/AG psychopathology. The reported results and previous research suggest that a fronto-limbic dysfunction might constitute an intermediate phenotype of PD/AG and thus a valid marker for disease risk. The understanding of the influence of genetic risk alleles on fear processing in patients with PD/AG and HC can be enhanced by our findings. It may help to form the basis of a more personalized treatment of PD/AG, in terms of personalized medicine. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis study was supported by the   (BMBF grant to AS 01GV0612; BMBF grant to KD and JD, project P5, 01EE1402A, PROTECT-AD) as part of the BMBF Psychotherapy Research Funding Initiative and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) \u2013 project number 44541416 \u2013 TRR 58 \u201cFear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders\u201d, within projects C02 (to KD and JD), Z02 (to KD, JD, UL and AR), C07 (to MJH) and project number DFG CRC 1193 within project Z03 to AR.

The aim of this explorative study was to investigate sex\u2010dependent differences in prefrontal cortex (PFC) functioning during a working memory (WM) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task in regular cocaine users (CUs), as PFC deficits are implicated in the shift from recreational cocaine use to CUD. Neural activation was measured using fMRI during a standard WM task (n\u2010back task) in 27 male and 28 female CUs and in 26 male and 28 female non\u2010cocaine users (non\u2010CUs). Although there were no main or interaction effects of sex and group on n\u2010back task performance, WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back) PFC functioning was significantly moderated by sex and group: female compared with male CUs displayed higher WM\u2010related activation of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), whereas female compared with male non\u2010CUs displayed lower WM\u2010related MFG activation. Additionally, WM\u2010related activation of the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, and putamen was negatively associated with cocaine use severity in female but not male CUs. These data support the hypothesis of sex\u2010dependent PFC differences in CUs and speculatively suggest that PFC deficits may be more strongly implicated in the development, continuation, and possibly treatment of CUD in females. Most importantly, the current data stress the importance of studying both males and females in psychiatry research as not doing so could greatly bias our knowledge of CUD and other psychiatric disorders. \n  \nRegular cocaine users display sex\u2010dependent differences in working memory\u2010related prefrontal recruitment, compared with nondrug using controls. These findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex is involved in the etiology of substance use disorders in a sex\u2010dependent matter.\n   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nCocaine is one of the most commonly used illicit drugs in Europe, and the prevalence of use has increased in the past decade.  Although the prevalence of cocaine use is 2\u20133 times higher in men than in women, this gap is slowly closing.  Although women start using cocaine at a later age, they are suggested to progress more rapidly to compulsive use and have higher relapse rates compared with men.  A better understanding of the role of sex in the (neuro)pathology of cocaine use disorder (CUD) could pave the way for the development of sex\u2010tailored treatment strategies. \n\nThe prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in cognitive control and emotion regulation, and compromised PFC functioning is thought to promote the shift from recreational to compulsive drug use.  The few studies that investigated the role of sex in CUDs showed lower dorsomedial and ventromedial PFC activity in female compared with male cocaine users (CUs) during cocaine cue imagery  and in response to negative emotional  and drug\u2010salient stimuli.  In contrast, female CUs also showed higher dorsomedial PFC activity in response to negative emotional stimuli.  Moreover, pharmacological enhancement of PFC functioning (using the noradrenergic \u03b12\u2010receptors agonist guanfacine) mitigated stress\u2010induced arousal and craving ,   and improved cognitive control  in CUD females, but not males. These studies suggest that PFC functioning is specifically impaired in females with a CUD in the context of emotionally salient stimuli, but it remains to be tested if these results generalize to cognitive control\u2010related processes. \n\nWorking memory (WM) refers to the ability to temporarily maintain, update, or manipulate information in an active state and is crucially involved in cognitive control. ,   WM performance is generally associated with activation of a network of various PFC and parietal brain areas, with increased WM load being associated with increased activation.  In various psychiatric disorders, stronger WM\u2010related (high WM load\u00a0>\u00a0low WM load) PFC activation (compared with a control population) is suggested to reflect compensatory but inefficient neural information processing, leading to deficits in WM performance. \n\nWM tasks generally require sustained attention, information storage, memory for temporal order as well as the updating and manipulation of information. ,   As such, WM\u2010related differences in neural activation in CUD populations may reflect differences in any of these functions. Neuroimaging research demonstrated WM\u2010related PFC deficits in CUD, although both higher WM\u2010related PFC activation (middle frontal gyrus [MFG])  and lower PFC activation (cingulate gyrus, middle, superior, and inferior frontal gyrus)  have been reported. Research in other substance use disorders (SUDs) reported similar mixed findings, including WM\u2010related (dorsomedial) PFC overrecruitment in alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients  and cannabis users.  Moreover, higher WM\u2010related (dorsolateral) PFC activity has been reported to predict cannabis use. ,  ,   In contrast, lower WM\u2010related PFC activation (middle and superior frontal gyrus, precentral and postcentral gyrus) has also been demonstrated in AUD patients, ,   with lower WM\u2010related activation of the rostral PFC and ventrolateral PFC predicting relapse to alcohol use. \n\nA possible explanation of previous conflicting findings could be that the majority of these studies did not account for sex differences. Although most neuroimaging WM meta\u2010analyses in nonsubstance using populations did not include sex in their analyses, a 2014 meta\u2010analysis demonstrated higher WM\u2010related limbic and (middle and medial) PFC activity in females but higher WM\u2010related parietal activity in males.  As such, omitting sex from the analyses could greatly obscure the interpretation of WM\u2010related neural deficits in psychiatric disorders, including CUD. \n\nTo date, only one study reported on sex differences in WM\u2010related PFC activation in CUD.  Although this study did not demonstrate any significant group (CUD vs. controls) by sex interaction effects on WM\u2010related PFC activation, this was likely due to insufficient statistical power (i.e., inclusion of three female vs. 16 male CUD patients). Based on the earlier described findings of lower dmPFC activation during the processing of emotionally salient stimuli in female compared with male CUD patients, ,  ,   and the finding that pharmacological enhancement of PFC functioning improved cognitive control while reducing arousal and craving in female CUD patients only, ,  ,  ,   sex\u2010dependent differences in WM\u2010related PFC activation can be expected as well. \n\nThe main aim of this study was to explore sex\u2010dependent differences in WM\u2010related PFC activation in a relatively large sample of regular CUs (27 males and 28 females) and non\u2010cocaine users (non\u2010CU: 26 males and 28 females) using a standardized WM paradigm (the n\u2010back task ). It was hypothesized that (i) CUs would show higher WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back; 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) PFC activation compared with non\u2010CUs, (ii) females would show higher WM\u2010related PFC activation compared with males, and (iii) WM\u2010related PFC activation would be highest in female CUs, reflecting inefficient WM\u2010related processes. Of note, because of the mixed and limited previous findings, the direction of these hypothesized effects is highly speculative. \n\n\n## METHODS AND MATERIALS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study is part of a large project designed to investigate the role of sex in the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying CUD. Fifty\u2010four regular CUs and 54 matched non\u2010CUs who conducted the n\u2010back functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task were included in this study. All participants were between 18 and 45\u00a0years of age and free from any MRI contraindications. CUs used cocaine (intranasally) at least four times a month in the past 6\u00a0months (CUs). Non\u2010CUs were excluded if they smoked regularly (at least once per week), had an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)  score\u00a0>\u00a012, used cocaine more than five times in their life, or used illicit substances more than five times in the past 6\u00a0months. All participants provided informed consent and received a monetary compensation. This study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences, University of Amsterdam (ERB number: 2019\u2010DP\u20109964). \n\n\n### Assessment of substance use and psychological functioning \n  \nSeverity of depressive symptoms was assed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI\u2010II ), state and trait anxiety was assessed using the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI ), attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) symptom severity was measured using the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD\u2010RS ), and impulsivity was assessed with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS\u201011 ) in all participants. The following characteristics of substance use were assessed in CUs only: severity of cocaine use and related problems in the past 12\u00a0months was assessed using the Drug Use Disorder Identification Test for cocaine (DUDIT ), cocaine use (grams and days per month) in the 28\u00a0days prior to study participation was assessed using the Time Line Follow\u2010Back procedure,  and onset age of regular use was assessed using an in\u2010house questionnaire. Moreover, motivation to change cocaine use was assessed using the Readiness to Change Questionnaire (RCQ ), smoking behavior (number of smoking days per week and cigarettes per day) was assessed using an in\u2010house questionnaire, severity of cannabis use was assessed using the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test\u2010Revised.  Current DSM\u20105 symptoms for CUD, and cannabis use disorder and AUD were assessed using a self\u2010reported questionnaire based on the SCID. \n\n\n### Procedures \n  \nParticipants were recruited through social media and local advertisements in the Amsterdam area, the Netherlands. After signing informed consent, participants were screened on inclusion and exclusion criteria. On the day of testing, participants first completed the questionnaires, after which the MRI scan was made. Participants were instructed to abstain from any drug use in the 24\u2010h preceding the MRI scan. \n\n\n### The   n  \u2010back task \n  \nThe n\u2010back task  consisted of alternating blocks with three load levels: 0\u2010back, 1\u2010back, and 2\u2010back. During each block, participants viewed a series of 15 letters in sequence, including five targets. Blocks lasted 30\u00a0s (each stimulus lasted 2\u00a0s), and the interblock interval was 5\u00a0s, during which the block instructions were repeated. In 0\u2010back blocks, participants were instructed to indicate when the target letter \u201cX\u201d appeared on the screen. In 1\u2010back blocks, participants had to decide if the letter on the screen was identical to the previous one. In 2\u2010back blocks, targets were those letters identical to the letter presented two trials back. Participants were instructed to press a right response box button for targets (right index finger) and a left button for nontargets (left index finger). No additional speed or accuracy instructions were given. Each load level was repeated four times resulting in a 7\u2010min task of 12 blocks. Prior to scanning, all participants first completed a practice block of the n\u2010back task outside of the scanner. \n\n\n### fMRI acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nA 3.0\u2010Tesla Philips Achieva scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) with a 32\u2010channel head coil was used for data acquisition. A T1\u20103D anatomical scan was acquired (TR/TE 8.2/3.8; matrix 240\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240; 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 mm  voxel; transversal slices, 8\u00b0 flip angle) for anatomical reference. Echo planar images (EPIs) were recorded during the n\u2010back task, with 36 ascending axial slices (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 mm  voxel size; slice gap 3\u00a0mm; TR/TE 1.999/28\u00a0ms; matrix 80\u00a0\u00d7\u00a080, 80\u00b0 flip angle). \n\nData were preprocessed using fMRIPrep 1.3.2 : the anatomical scans were corrected for intensity nonuniformity, skull\u2010stripped, spatially normalized, and segmented into cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and gray matter. The functional data were corrected for susceptibility distortions using a deformation field and subsequently coregistered, motion corrected, and smoothed. ICA\u2010AROMA  was used to automatically remove motion artifacts, and data were resampled to standard space. Further details on the pre\u2010processing pipeline can be found in the  . \n\nfMRI data were further analyzed using SPM12 ( ). First level models included separate regressors for the 0\u2010back, 1\u2010back, and 2\u2010back blocks. These regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. A high pass filter (1/128\u00a0Hz) was included in the first\u2010level model to correct for low\u2010frequency signal drift. The contrasts for the 0\u2010back, 1\u2010back, and 2\u2010back blocks were subsequently entered in a second level model to test for the main and interaction effects of sex, group, and n\u2010back load. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nDemographics, scores on (clinical) questionnaires, and n\u2010back behavioral performance were compared between groups with standard univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS for Windows (v.26.0). Differences between groups and sexes in age, alcohol use severity (AUDIT), depressive symptoms (BDI), state and trait anxiety (STAI), impulsivity (BIS\u201011), and ADHD symptom severity (ADHD\u2010RS) were assessed using 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 ANOVAs, testing both main and interaction effects. One\u2010way ANOVAs were subsequently used to test sex differences within the CU group in cocaine use (grams per month and days per month), cocaine use severity (DUDIT), onset age of regular cocaine use, and cannabis use severity (CUDIT). Chi\u2010square tests were additionally used to test for sex differences in the severity of cocaine, alcohol, and cannabis use disorder (mild, moderate, or severe according to the DSM\u20105 criteria), the prevalence of smoking (percent weekly smokers and percent daily smokers), and motivation to change cocaine use. Sex and group differences in n\u2010back performance were assessed in terms of mean reaction time of correct responses and accuracy (proportion correct), using repeated measures ANOVAs. \n\nTo test for main and interaction effects of group, sex, and n\u2010back load (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back and 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back), a whole\u2010brain analysis was performed, with mean framewise displacement (FD) values for each subject as covariate of noninterest to account for potential motion effect. Whole brain analyses were family\u2010wise error (FWE) rate corrected on cluster level (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05), with an initial height threshold on the voxel level of   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001. This analysis was repeated to test whether significant effects were still present after correcting for potential confounding variables. Variables were treated as confounders when there was a significant interaction effect between group and sex on these variables. This was tested for age, education, AUDIT, BDI, ADHD\u2010RS, STAI, and BIS. When a significant whole brain interaction effect was found, the nature of this interaction was explored by performing pairwise comparisons (between sexes within groups and between groups within sexes) using a small volume correction where the mask of the significant cluster served as a the small volume. Additionally, the Marsbar toolbox ( ) was used to extract the mean activity of the significant cluster(s) visualization purposes. \n\nA second whole brain analysis was performed within the CU group only, with cocaine use (grams per month), cocaine use severity (DUDIT\u2010scores), as well as its interaction with sex as regressors of interest, correcting for variations in FD, to test whether cocaine use and cocaine use severity were associated with WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back; 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) brain activity in a sex\u2010dependent matter. This analysis was repeated to test whether significant effects were still present after correcting for potential confounding variables. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Demographic and clinical characteristics \n  \nOn average, male and female CUs started using cocaine regularly at the age of 23.5 and 21.4 and used 5.5 and 3.8\u00a0g of cocaine per month, on 7.4 and 4.9\u00a0days, respectively. Most CUs met the DSM\u20105 criteria for CUD (males: 85%, females: 89%). Based on the RCQ, the majority of CUs was actively trying to change cocaine intake (males: 59%, females: 63%), although only 3% of the participants reported to have (had) professional help for reducing their cocaine use. Two thirds of all CUs met the DSM\u20105 criteria for AUD (males: 85%, females: 59%), whereas less than one third of the CUs met the DSM\u20105 criteria for cannabis use disorder (males: 30%, females: 15%). There were no sex differences in the amount of cocaine used per month, readiness to change cocaine use, tobacco use, the prevalence of a DSM\u20105 diagnosis for CUD, cannabis use disorder or AUD, cocaine use severity (DUDIT), alcohol use severity (AUDIT), or cannabis use severity (CUDIT\u2010R). The only significant sex difference was that CU females reported to use cocaine on fewer days per month compared with CU males. Therefore, days of cocaine use per month was treated as a confounder in an exploratory within\u2010group fMRI analysis. See Table\u00a0  for detailed substance use characteristics and statistics. \n  \nSubstance use characteristics in male and female cocaine users \n    \nCUs and non\u2010CUs had similar age, educational level, and trait anxiety scores, but CUs had significantly higher AUDIT, state anxiety, impulsivity (BIS attention and BIS planning), and ADHD\u2010RS (childhood and past 6\u00a0month) scores. Additionally, females had significant higher state anxiety scores compared with males, whereas males reported higher childhood ADHD\u2010RS than females. There was a significant group by sex interaction effect on depressive symptoms (BDI scores), impulsivity (BIS total and motor subscale), and ADHD\u2010RS scores in the past 6\u00a0months. Follow\u2010up tests revealed that although both male CUs and female CUs scored higher on these variables compared with non\u2010CU male and non\u2010CU females, female CUs had significant higher BDI, BIS total and BIS motor scores compared with male CUs, while no such sex differences were present within non\u2010CUs. Because of these differences, BDI, BIS motor, BIS total, and adult ADHD\u2010RS scores were treated as confounders in the fMRI analyses. See Table\u00a0  for all values and statistics. \n  \nDemographic and clinical variables: Main and interaction effects of group and sex \n    \n\n### Behavioral results n\u2010back task \n  \nThere were no significant differences between groups or sexes in n\u2010back performance. There was a significant main effect of n\u2010back load (  F  \u00a0=\u00a0182.11,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001) on reaction times, with reaction times increasing with increasing n\u2010back load. The other main or interaction effects were not significant. There was a significant main effect of n\u2010back load (  F  \u00a0=\u00a0103.47,   p  \u00a0<\u00a00.001) on accuracy, with accuracy decreasing with increasing n\u2010back load. The other main and interaction effects were nonsignificant. See Figure\u00a0 . See the   for a sensitivity analysis on how large the effect size needs to be to demonstrate significant main and interaction effects of group and sex. \n  \nMain and interaction effects of working memory (WM) load, group, and sex on reaction time and percentage correct during the n\u2010back task. Although there was a main effect of WM\u2010load on reaction time (increase) and percentage correct (decrease), these effects were not moderated by sex, group, or both. CU, cocaine user; WM, working memory \n  \n\n### fMRI results n\u2010back task \n  \n#### Main task effect \n  \nThe main task effects were as expected, with strong WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back and 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) activation of fronto\u2010parietal areas and deactivation of the default mode network (Figure\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ). \n  \nMain and interaction effects of WM load, group and sex. In red, brain regions activated with increasing WM load. In blue, brain regions deactivated with increasing WM\u2010load. In green, group differences in WM\u2010related brain activation that are significantly moderated by sex. Mean activity of the whole cluster is extracted and plotted for visualization purposes. The error bars represent the 90% confidence interval. CU, cocaine user; WM, working memory \n  \n\n#### WM\u2010load, group and sex interaction effects \n  \nWM\u2010related brain activation (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back or 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) did not differ between groups or sexes. For the 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back contrast, there was a significant group by sex interaction in the left dorsal MFG (dMFG). See Table\u00a0  and Figure\u00a0 . Pairwise comparisons on this specific cluster demonstrated that the non\u2010CU males had higher WM\u2010related activation in this region than non\u2010CU females (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.002), although no such difference was between CU males and females. In addition, within non\u2010CU males displayed higher WM\u2010related activation in this region compared to CU males (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.006), whereas CU females displayed higher activation in this region compared to non\u2010CU females (  p  \u00a0=\u00a00.002). Adding BDI, BIS\u2010total, BIS\u2010motor, and ADHD symptom severity scores as regressors of noninterest in the whole brain analysis did not alter the outcomes of these analyses (results not reported). There was no significant group by sex interaction effect for the 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back contrast. \n  \nMain and interaction effects of group and sex on working memory\u2010related whole brain activation \n    \nAn exploratory regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back) dMFG activation and cocaine use severity, grams of cocaine use per month, and days of cocaine use per month in the CU group only. This analysis (with FD and sex included as covariates) demonstrated that none of these variables were significantly associated with WM\u2010related dMFG activation (DUDIT:   B  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.15,   t  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.97,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.34; days/month:   B  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.46,   t  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.99,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.051; grams/month:   B  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.04,   t  \u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.26,   p  \u00a0=\u00a00.80). \n\n\n#### Within CU group whole brain regression analyses \n  \nWhole brain regression analyses with cocaine use (grams of cocaine per month) and cocaine use severity (DUDIT scores) in the CU group demonstrated that cocaine use was negatively associated with WM\u2010related activation of the vermis (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back) and right calcarine sulcus/bilateral cuneus (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back and 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back). Cocaine use was positively associated with WM\u2010related activation of the left cerebellum (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back and 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) and lingual gyrus and vermis (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back). The association between cocaine use and WM\u2010related activation of the cerebellum, vermis, and occipital cortex was significantly moderated by sex: the association was positive in males but negative in females. In addition, although cocaine use was not associated with any WM\u2010related brain activation, the association between cocaine use severity and WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) activation in the left insula, inferior frontal gyrus, the cerebellum, and vermis was also moderated by sex, with a negative association in females, but not in males. Adding days of cocaine use per month as confounder to the model did not change the outcome of these results. See Table 4 and Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nWorking memory load\u2010related activation (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) of the insula, putamen, and inferior frontal gyrus (in red) is negatively associated with drug use severity in cocaine using women but not in in cocaine using men. Nonetheless, the brain activation patterns are in the similar range as non\u2010cocaine using controls. Mean activity of the whole cluster is extracted and plotted for visualization purposes. The error bars represent the 90% confidence interval. CU, cocaine user \n  \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nWomen have been structurally ignored in addiction\u2010related (neuroimaging) research, and therefore, little is known about sex differences in the neuropathology of addiction. The aim of this explorative study was to investigated sex differences in WM\u2010related PFC functioning in regular CUs, as deficits in PFC\u2010mediated cognitive control are crucially involved in the transition from recreational to compulsive cocaine use.  WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back; 2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a01\u2010back) PFC activity was hypothesized to be higher in CUs compared with non\u2010CUs, with larger differences in female compare with male CUs. There was no main effect of group or sex on brain activity or behavior; however, we did observe a significant group by sex interaction effect in WM\u2010related (2\u2010back\u00a0>\u00a00\u2010back) left dMFG activation: CU females displayed higher dMFG activity compared with non\u2010CU females, whereas CU males displayed lower dMFG activity compared with non\u2010CU males. Furthermore, WM\u2010related activation of the vlPFC (including the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, and putamen) was negatively associated with cocaine use severity in female CUs, but not in males. Heightened WM\u2010related PFC activation is suggested to reflect compensatory but inefficient information processing, leading to WM deficits.  As such, the current data support our hypothesis that PFC deficits are more strongly implicated in the neuropathology of CUD in females compared with males. Importantly, these findings highlight an urgent need to further unravel the role of sex in the mechanisms underlying CUD. \n\nAlthough heightened WM\u2010related PFC activation in CUD (compared with a control group) may reflect compensatory (but inefficient) mechanisms, ,   heightened PFC activation in recreative CUs (in the absence of behavioral deficits) has also been suggested to reflect resilience to stimulant dependence. In line with this, heightened WM\u2010related activation of the ventrolateral and ventromedial PFC has been shown to protect against relapse in alcohol dependent patients.  In the current study, inferior frontal gyrus activity was negatively associated with cocaine use severity in female CUs only, perhaps reflecting sex\u2010dependent resilience against the development of compulsive cocaine use. It should be noted, though, that the majority of CUs included in our study already transitioned from recreational to compulsive cocaine use. Alternatively, although WM\u2010related dMFG activation was unrelated to cocaine use (severity), the negative association between cocaine use severity and WM\u2010related ventrolateral PFC recruitment may reflect a sex\u2010specific (neurotoxic) effect of cocaine use on the brain, supporting the hypothesis that females are more vulnerable to the (neurotoxic) effects of substances, including cocaine and alcohol. \n\nUnexpectedly, dMFG activation was higher in non\u2010CU males compared with non\u2010CU females. This is remarkable, as females generally display higher WM\u2010related middle and medial PFC activity compared with males.  Interestingly, although various PFC regions are shown to be more active in females compared with males during WM\u2010related tasks,  there seems to be a sex\u2010dependent effect on the lateralization of WM\u2010related dMFG activity as well: higher WM\u2010related activation of the   right   MFG was found in females compared with males, whereas higher WM\u2010related activation of the   left   MFG was found in males,  which is in line with our finding in non\u2010CUs. Sex differences in WM\u2010related brain functioning and lateralization are suggested to result from a combination of prenatal hormonal (testosterone) exposure  and gender\u2010related factors later in life.  Consequently, the current findings may be the result of neurodevelopmental differences, reflecting a sex\u2010dependent predisposition to CUD rather than a consequence of cocaine use. \n\nIt is important to note that no significant group or sex differences were found in behavioral n\u2010back performance. However, the n\u2010back task is generally considered to be less reliable to assess behavioral WM\u2010related deficits.  As such, the behavioral implications of the current findings remain speculative and future research may benefit from including a more reliable WM task outside the MRI scanner to assess behavioral WM performance. \n\nAlthough the causal interplay between PFC functioning, CUD and sex can only be established with future longitudinal research, the current findings suggest that PFC deficits are more strongly implicated in the development, continuation, and perhaps also treatment of CUD in women. Because pharmacological enhancement of PFC control (using the noradrenergic \u03b12\u2010receptors agonist guanfacine)  reduced arousal and craving and improved cognitive control in women with a CUD specifically, ,  ,   women with a CUD may benefit more from interventions targeted at improving PFC\u2010related cognitive and emotional control processes. \n\nInconsistent results from previous SUD studies ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   may be explained by highly variable but mainly low numbers of female participants. An important strength of the current study is that it was specifically set\u2010up to elucidate sex differences in PFC functioning in regular CUs and non\u2010CUs. As such, CU males and females were matched on most cocaine\u2010use\u2010related variables. Although we focused on including nontreatment seeking CUs, the majority of all included CUs met the DSM\u20105 criteria of CUD and were actively trying to change their cocaine use based on the readiness to change questionnaire. Therefore, the current findings likely generalize to treatment seeking CUs as well. \n\nA limitation of the current study is that we only tested for sex differences without taking gender taking into account. According to the Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines, gender is an equally important determinant of health and well\u2010being as sex.  Although the terms sex and gender are often confused in scientific literature, gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviors, and identities of female, male, and gender\u2010diverse people, whereas sex refers to a set of biological attributes in humans and animals that are associated with physiological features. Future research should take gender as a potential moderating factor in the (neuro)pathology of addiction into account, for example, by calculating a gender index based on a variety of psychosocial gender\u2010related variables.  Moreover, CUD is generally associated with polysubstance use. Indeed, approximately two thirds of CUs met the DSM\u20105 criteria of an AUD and almost one third met the DMS\u20105 criteria of a cannabis use disorder. Although there were no sex differences in the prevalence of comorbid SUDs, we have previously demonstrated that deficits in PFC structure are strongly associated with the amount of polysubstance use across regular CUs.  Hence, we cannot fully exclude potential confounding effects of other substances on PFC functioning in the current study. In this study, we instructed CUs to remain abstinent for 24\u00a0h prior to study participation. We decided to not perform a urine screening to check this as cocaine metabolites can be detected in urine up to 6\u00a0days after the last use in regular CUs,  which is much longer than its psychopharmacological effects. A urine test would, therefore, not have been a very accurate measure of intoxication in this specific population. Instead, we used the time\u2010line follow\u2010back procedure to assess cocaine (and other substance) use prior to the experiment, which is generally considered to be a highly reliable method to asses information about substance use, including cocaine use, in both treatment and nontreatment seeking populations.  Nonetheless, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that some CUs were (still) under the influence of some substances. \n\nIn conclusion, the current study provides important first evidence for sex\u2010dependent differences in WM\u2010related PFC recruitment among regular CUs. Although speculative, these data suggest that PFC deficits are more strongly implicated in the development, continuation, and possibly treatment of CUD in females compared with males. Most importantly, the current findings highlight the crucial need for (i) including both males and females in (pre)clinical addiction research and (ii) disaggregating (neuroimaging) findings for males and females separately.  Doing so will not only lead to a better understanding of (sex differences in) the (neuro)pathology of addiction but could also pave the way for the development of sex\u2010tailored treatment of SUDs. \n\n\n## FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE \n  \nThe project was funded by an Amsterdam Brain and Cognition Talent Grant.

Many of the acupoint laser stimulation conditions resulted in different patterns of neural activity. Regions with significantly increased activation included the limbic cortex (cingulate) and the frontal lobe (middle and superior frontal gyrus). Laser acupuncture tended to be associated with ipsilateral brain activation and contralateral deactivation that therefore cannot be simply attributed to somatosensory stimulation. \n\n\n## Conclusions/Significance \n  \nWe found that laser stimulation of acupoints lead to activation of frontal-limbic-striatal brain regions, with the pattern of neural activity somewhat different for each acupuncture point. This is the first study to investigate laser acupuncture on a group of acupoints useful in the management of depression. Differing activity patterns depending on the acupoint site were demonstrated, suggesting that neurological effects vary with the site of stimulation. The mechanisms of activation and deactivation and their effects on depression warrant further investigation. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDespite the remarkable developments in Western Medicine in modern times, public interest in Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (TCAM), such as acupuncture, remains high  ,  . This may be because TCAM is perceived as holistic and relatively free of adverse effects. However, these treatments sit uncomfortably alongside scientific medicine because of strikingly different explanatory systems and the empirical tests applied by each discipline. In order to bridge the gulf between high public acceptability and the lack of empirical evidence for many of these treatments, it is important to reconcile them with modern scientific concepts. Our focus here is on laser acupuncture, and we address the question whether laser acupuncture produces brain effects that are biologically plausible. \n\nThere have been many studies  \u2013  some of which have involved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) of the brain effects of needle acupuncture. Some neuroimaging and neuroendocrine studies have suggested that needle acupuncture affects hypothalamic as well as extrahypothalamic functions and modulates mood  ,  \u2013 . Needling of the leg acupoint ST36 and the hand acupoint LI4 was shown to activate the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens and deactivate the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC)  . Superficial needling (i.e. needling that did not produce the classical   de qi   sensation - tingling, numbness or other sensations that occur after an acupuncture needle has been properly placed in the body) and non-acupoints (i.e. points on the skin that do not lie on recognized meridians in Traditional Chinese Medicine [TCM]) did not activate the hypothalamus  . Stimulation of the acupoint PC6, located above the wrist, recommended for a wide range of conditions from nausea to stress management, resulted in activation of the cerebellum, dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus  . All of these studies have used needle acupuncture which, although more traditional, is invasive. \n\nWhile laser acupuncture has become an increasingly common clinical method, particularly in primary care, its empirical basis has been less well studied to date. Whereas needle acupuncture studies have shown activation and deactivation of the somatosensory cortex  ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 , superficial needling and laser intervention appear to stimulate cortical and subcortical structures other than the somatosensory cortex  ,  ,  . This is consistent with the observation that low intensity laser stimulation does not produce a skin sensation. For example, laser acupuncture of a foot acupoint, classically used for treating visual problems, was demonstrated to cause activation of the occipital cortex  . \n\nThis study has used laser delivered at low intensity as used in primary care. Other studies have reported high intensity lasers can produce de qi sensation  . High intensity laser is not commonly used in primary care situations and therefore was not used in the current study. Further, as low intensity laser does not result in sensory sensation it is ideal for double blind randomized controlled studies where the subjects could not differentiate between placebo (laser off) and verum laser (laser on). \n\nThe evidence suggests that cortical activation does occur with acupuncture and this activation may be specific to certain brain regions in relation to the site and type of stimulation  \u2013 . In practice, acupoint efficacy is not specific, and one acupoint can be used for several different conditions, just as one medical condition can be managed with several acupoint locations. For instance, the antidepressant effect of laser acupuncture   has been attributed to a group of acupoints - CV14, LR14, LR8 and HT7 (see   for anatomical location), however there are other acupoint combinations that are also applicable for the management of depression. The neurological effects of stimulation of these acupoints CV14, LR14, HT7 and LR8 in combination have yet to be investigated. \n\nIn this study, we examined the blood oxygen level dependant (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response to laser simulation on the above mentioned acupoints CV14, LR14, LR8 and HT7. We chose laser acupuncture as it permits blinding of application because of the lack of a local sensation at low intensity, together with the previously mentioned increases in practical usage and limited understanding of its mechanisms. We reasoned that if laser acupuncture is altering a person's mental state a neurological effect should be observable. Further, if the effect differs dependent on the site of stimulation, then the neural locus of the activity should also differ. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Ethics Statement \n  \nThe study was approved by the human research ethics committee of the South Eastern Sydney & Illawarra Area Health Service and participants provided written informed consent before participation. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nThe participants (n\u200a=\u200a10) (7 women, 3 men) were healthy volunteers aged 18\u201350 years (mean age \u200a=\u200a39.8 years) who were recruited by advertisement from the staff and students of the University of New South Wales and Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia. All participants were right-handed and had no past history of depression or other psychiatric disorder, a Beck Depression Inventory   score <10, no history of drug or alcohol abuse, no medication intake within 3 months of the study, and no neurological or systemic disorders. Eight were acupuncture na\u00efve and two had had needle acupuncture more than 3 months previously and did not know what to expect from laser intervention. Any contra-indications to MRI (pacemaker, ferromagnetic implants or foreign body, claustrophobia) were exclusionary. \n\n\n### Choice of acupoints and control point \n  \nThe acupoints were selected based on results from our previous study   and the TCM for mood disorders  ,  . These acupoints lay on the classically named liver (LR), heart (HT) and conception vessel (CV) meridians. The selected points, labelled LR8, LR14, HT7 and CV14 in TCM, are shown in  . LR8 is in the medial knee region, between the insertions of the sartorius and semitendinosus muscles. LR14 is in the vicinity of the 6th intercostal space on the mid clavicular line. HT7 is at the wrist crease, in the vicinity of the radial side of the flexor carpi ulnaris. CV14 is in the anterior midline, approximately 5 cm below the xiphisternum. A control non-acupoint was selected on the abdominal surface, midway between SP15 (four cun from the umbilicus) and ST25 (two cun from the umbilicus) away from the abdominal meridians. \n   Selected acupoints relevant to mood and depression.  \nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Liver (LR) meridian is used to treat depression. Two LR points were used: LR14 and LR 8. Two other acupoints considered important in depression were also used (CV 14 and HT 7). The control point (sham point or non acupoint) was located midway between SP15 and ST 25 acupoints. \n  \n\n### fMRI design \n  \nA block design was used, with each block of 20 seconds duration during which the subject received either laser stimulation (switched \u2018on\u2019) or placebo stimulation (switched \u2018off\u2019) at one acupoint. The infra red laser was held with light touch on the skin surface by the acupuncturist. Since the laser produces no sensation, the subject was able to be kept blind to the phase of stimulation. The on-off cycle was repeated 4 times for each acupoint (LR14, LR8, CV14, HT7), with the 4 acupoints being stimulated twice in random order. The control point near ST25 was stimulated once per subject. The block design accomodated for the placebo (laser off) condition during its rest phases. In total there were nine runs per subject. The subject was told to relax and keep his/her eyes closed during the entire time in the scanner. \n\n\n### Laser stimulation \n  \nA Moxla  prototype fiberoptic infra-red light laser (808 nm) with 25 mW capacity and a fiber optic arm was developed for usage in the scanning room. The laser parameters are similar to the one used in the clinical study we have based our investigation upon  . The acupoints were marked with a skin marking pencil prior to entry into the scanning room. A stably held laser was applied to the skin by the acupuncturist (IQ-S) who moved it from point to point according to the time signal. The switching on and off was achieved with a computer signal time-locked to the MRI acquisition. \n\n\n### fMRI \n  \nImaging was performed on a 3T Philips Intera MRI scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands) for both T1-weighted 3D structural and BOLD contrast functional MRI. The 3D structural MRI was acquired in sagittal orientation using a T1-weighted TFE sequence (TR/TE \u200a=\u200a6.39/2.9 ms; flip angle \u200a=\u200a8; matrix size \u200a=\u200a256\u00d7256; FOV \u200a=\u200a256\u00d7256 mm; slice thickness 1.0 mm), yielding sagittal slices of 1.0 mm thick and an in-plane spatial resolution of 1.0\u00d71.0 mm, producing an isotropic voxel of 1.0\u00d71.0\u00d71.0 mm. A gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) technique (TR/TE\u200a=\u200a2000/40 ms; matrix size \u200a=\u200a128\u00d7128; FOV\u200a=\u200a250\u00d7250 mm; in plane pixel size 1.953\u00d71.953 mm) was used to acquire T2-weighted BOLD contrast fMRI in axial orientation. The whole brain was covered using 21 slices at 5.0 mm slice thickness and 0.5 mm gap for each volume. Each session of 96 volumes were collected with the rate of 2s/volume. \n\n\n### Image preprocessing and statistical analysis \n  \nImaging data were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM2, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) implemented in Matlab version 6 (The Mathworks Inc., USA). All volumes were realigned spatially to the first volume and the time-series for voxels within each slice realigned temporally to acquisition of the middle slice. Resulting volumes were normalized to a standard EPI template based on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). The normalized images were smoothed with an isotropic 8 mm full-width half-maximal Gaussian kernel. The time-series in each voxel were highpass-filtered to 1/120 Hz to remove low-frequency noise. \n\nStatistical analysis was performed in two stages, assuming a random effects design. Each stimulation site was compared to the placebo (laser off) condition for first level analysis. The BOLD response to the laser acupuncture stimulation was modeled by a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). The second level analysis (ANOVA) used each individual subject's contrast images, which were effectively the statistical parametric maps of the t-statistics for each voxel. The data had a threshold of p <0.001 with a spatial extent of 15 contiguous voxels. \n\n\n### Post-imaging Assessment \n  \nAfter the scanning session, subjects rated selected items on the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory   to describe their mental state during the period of the scanning. The ratings were: 1 (not at all), 2 (somewhat), 3 (moderately so) and 4 (very much so). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Group analysis \n  \nAt the group level, there were significant increases (activation) in BOLD levels in some brain regions for acupoints LR14, CV14, LR8 and the control point compared to all the other points (verum laser per point > all others, p<0.001; see  ). Further, there were significant decreases (deactivation) in BOLD levels for acupoints LR14, LR8 and the control point compared to all the other points (all others > verum laser per point, p<0.001; see  ) in other brain regions. \n   Significant brain activation patterns from laser acupuncture to LR14, CV14, LR8 and control point.      \nWith LR8, activation of ipsilateral limbic cortex (cingulate gyrus) and deactivation of bilateral frontal cortices (middle frontal gyrus), (contralateral superior frontal gyrus), contralateral temporal cortex (middle temporal gyrus) and contralateral caudate occurred. Stimulation at the LR14 acupoint resulted in activation of contralateral frontal cortex (superior and middle frontal gyrii), contralateral parietal cortex (postcentral gyrus) and deactivation of contralateral cerebellum (cerebellar tonsil) and contralateral occipital cortex (precuneus). Acupoint CV14 produced activation of the left limbic cortex in the posterior cingulate and there was no significant deactivation in the grey matter. HT7 had no significant activation or deactivation. The control point (non acupoint or sham point), activated the contralateral parietal cortex (postcentral gyrus). It also deactivated the contralateral limbic cortex (parahippocampal gyrus). \n\n\n### Somatosensory cortex and laterality of cerebral activation and deactivation \n  \nOur study involved randomized stimulation of the 4 acupoints and a control point. Although there was activation of contralateral postcentral gyrus (primary somatosensory cortex or SSI) with LR14 and control point, none of the other acupoints showed any activation of the somatosensory cortex. The cortical and subcortical structures activated with stimulation of the limb acupoints tended to be largely ipsilateral to the side of stimulation. \n\nAll the acupoints and control point did not have deactivation at the somatosensory cortex. However they all had contralateral deactivations with the exception of LR8 that had bilateral middle frontal gyrus deactivation. \n\n\n### Behavioral observations \n  \nParticipants did not describe anxiety or discomfort during scanning, except for one who found the headphones uncomfortable. The mean Spielberger scale ratings were on select items were: feeling calm (3.3), secure (3.3), relaxed (3.3), nervous (1.4), jittery (1.1), worried (1.1) or overexcited and rattled (1.1). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis is the first fMRI study to examine the effects of laser stimulation of a suite of acupoints found to be efficacious in a clinical condition (depression). A salient feature of this study was that four acupoints and a control non-acupoint (sham point) were stimulated in a random design. The subjects were unaware of the relative significance of different acupoints. The use of low level laser acupuncture, which does not produce a skin sensation, permitted the blinding of subjects to verum or placebo stimulation, something difficult to achieve with needle acupuncture. \n\nThe main finding of our study was that each acupoint or control point resulted in a different pattern of brain activity when contrasted against all the other acupoints or control point. The acupoints we investigated in this study were those that have been used in our previous treatment study for depression  . This finding suggests that although these acupoints are all used in the treatment of depression, the neural locus of this effect differs depending upon the site stimulated. The efficacy of these acupoints in the treatment of depression may vary greatly between patients and site stimulated, and our findings may shed some light on these effects  . \n\nThe neuroanatomical basis of depression is not completely understood, however a number of studies have implicated abnormalities in certain brain regions, in particular the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the cingulate gyrus and the so-called limbic brain regions (hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, septal nuclei, insula, thalamus) and paralimbic regions (orbitofrontal cortex, anterior temporal lobe)  \u2013 . There is converging evidence from drug treatment, cognitive-behavior therapy and brain stimulation techniques that antidepressant treatments work by modulating frontal-subcortical neuronal circuits. The most consistently reported finding is that antidepressant treatments lead to a normalization of activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with additional changes in the subgenual cingulate region, the posterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus and insula  . Whether the change in prefrontal cortex is a primary event or secondary to changes in subcortical nuclei is unclear, but the relationship of treatment response to this suggests that it is biologically plausible that laser acupuncture could be an effective antidepressant treatment through its effects on the above brain regions. \n\nThe results show this combination of acupoints activating frontal cortex, limbic cortex and subcortical caudate. The trend is for ipsilateral activation suggestive of neurological circuitry outside the dorsal spinal columns and more likely to be autonomically driven  \u2013 . Most of the deactivations were contralateral. Also LR14 and control point activations included primary somatosensory cortical activations (SSI). None of the deactivations involved SSI, however they did include the regions as described earlier that could collectively be called the affective cortex (the frontal, limbic and temporal cortices as well as the subcortical caudate). This combination of ipsilateral and contralateral activations and deactivations may perhaps be representative of the combined actions of both the spinal and autonomic nervous systems during laser acupuncture. \n\nIn classical acupuncture, there are primary and secondary acupoints for the treatment of any disorder. The approach to acupoint selection can be variable, with primary acupoints being considered essential and secondary acupoints additive for some patients. In our study, we cannot predict from these results whether any acupoint should be preferred over others for clinical use, even though LR8 deactivated more brain regions (middle and superior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and the subcortical caudate) than all the other points. These are results from a sample of healthy subjects. The question of whether the results would be different in a sample of clinically depressed subjects, needs to still be answered. Further studies are required to explore the relative value of different acupoints, the final test for which naturally lies in a clinical trial. It also cannot be stated from our study whether the treatment response can be achieved with stimulation at one point alone, or if multiple points are necessary. \n\nThere is conflicting evidence regarding acupoint specificity and whether that specificity is relative rather than absolute for any particular disorder  \u2013 . Furthermore, it is debatable whether the clinical effects of acupuncture are restricted to stimulation on points that lie on the classical meridians in TCM. Our finding that laser stimulation of a non-acupoint produced some brain activation suggest that there is unlikely to be a completely neutral control non-acupoint, and this should prompt a re-examination of the use of sham points (in needle acupuncture studies) as control hence minimizing the true statistical effects of any acupoint  \u2013 . It is also interesting that laser acupuncture in this study appeared to preferentially activate the limbic cortex ipsilaterally and deactivate the limbic cortex contralaterally. It has been suggested that laser stimulation preferentially activates unmyelinated afferent fibers that project ipsilaterally to the insula  \u2013 , which might also explain the differences from needle acupuncture. \n\nThis laser acupuncture fMRI study demonstrated the central effects of stimulation of a suite of acupoints found to be efficacious in treating depression in a primary care setting. The multiple acupoints each activated different groupings of frontal-limbic-striatal brain regions, suggesting some acupoint specificity but also a commonality in the regions affected. There was a trend for the limb acupoints to cause ipsilateral activation and contralateral de-activation. The results of the study suggest that laser acupuncture is a biologically plausible anti-depressant treatment. Its efficacy and the relative merits of the different proposed acupoints must be empirically examined. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0012619-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nACUPOINT\tx\ty\tz\tpvox\tNo of Voxels\tBrain Region\nActivation\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLR14\t\u221228\t\u221242\t68\t0.0\t169.0\tLeft Postcentral Gyrus\n\t\u221226\t\u22126\t62\t0.0\t85.0\tLeft Superior Frontal Gyrus\n\t\u221244\t34\t26\t0.0\t20.0\tLeft Middle Frontal Gyrus\nCV14\t\u221210\t\u221250\t6\t0.0\t84.0\tLeft Posterior Cingulate\nLR8\t\u22126\t0\t42\t0.0\t48.0\tLeft Cingulate Gyrus\nControl Point\t50\t\u221226\t48\t0.0\t40.0\tRight Postcentral Gyrus\nDeactivation\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLR14\t\u221226\t\u221242\t\u221232\t0.0\t54.0\tLeft Cerebellar Tonsil\n\t\u22128\t\u221266\t18\t0.0\t69.0\tLeft Occipital Lobe, Precuneus\nLR8\t36\t6\t52\t0.0\t96.0\tRight Middle Frontal Gyrus\n\t\u221226\t12\t62\t0.0\t83.0\tLeft Middle Frontal Gyrus\n\t20\t14\t54\t0.0\t151.0\tRight Superior Frontal Gyrus\n\t42\t\u221260\t22\t0.0\t131.0\tRight Middle Temporal Gyrus\n\t10\t8\t8\t0.0\t35.0\tRight Caudate\nControl Point\t\u221226\t\u221256\t\u22124\t0.0\t182.0\tLeft Parahippocampal Gyrus\n### Caption\nSignificant brain activation patterns from laser acupuncture to LR14, CV14, LR8 and control point.\n### Footer\nNone\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 2935390, "text_md5": "e76de9fb6a52cb49d291eea4a81777ab", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 93], "journal": [94, 102], "publication_year": [104, 108], "title": [119, 203], "keywords": [217, 217], "abstract": [230, 2054], "body": [2063, 21892], "tables": [21905, 22833]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 20838644, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0012619", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2935390", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=2935390"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2935390\">2935390</a>", "list_title": "PMC2935390  The Brain Effects of Laser Acupuncture in Healthy Individuals: An fMRI Investigation"}

It has been hypothesized that the cerebellum regulates the acquisition of sensory data across all modalities, and thus, that VWM load activations may reflect high- vs low-load differences in sensory acquisition demands. Therefore, increased difficulty in sensory data acquisition should elicit greater activation in the cerebellum. The present fMRI study manipulated sensory acquisition in VWM by presenting visually degraded and non-degraded stimuli with high and low memory loads, thereby identifying load-dependent regions of interest in the cerebellum, and then testing if these regions showed greater activation for degraded stimuli.\u00a0Results yielded partial support for the sensory acquisition hypothesis in a load-dependent region of the vermis, which showed significantly greater activation for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli. Because eye movements did not differ for these stimulus types, and degradation-related activations were present after co-varying eye movements, this activation appears to be related to perceptual rather than oculomotor demands. In contrast to the vermis, load-sensitive regions of the cerebellar hemispheres did not show increased activation for degraded stimuli. These findings point to an overall function of association-based\u00a0prediction that may underlie general cerebellar function, with perceptual prediction of stimuli from partial representations occurring in the vermis, and articulatory prediction occurring in the hemispheres. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nA growing body of evidence is demonstrating that the cerebellum is not only involved in motor coordination and motor learning, but also in non-motor functions, such as linguistic processes (for a review see Mari\u00ebn and Borgatti  ), affective processing and emotional regulation (e.g., Lupo et al.  ; Jeremy Schmahmann  ; Schmahmann and Sherman  ), executive functions (Bellebaum and Daum  ; B\u00fcrk et al.  ), working memory (e.g., Desmond et al.  ; Hayter et al.  ; Peterburs et al.  ; Ravizza et al.  ), and timing (Breska and Ivry  ; Coull et al.  ; Ivry  ). It has been suggested that the cerebellum may sub-serve overarching functions irrespective of the domain, by involvement in more general processes of performance monitoring (Peterburs and Desmond  ), prediction and the generation of internal models (Ito  ; Wolpert et al.  ), sequence detection in the context of both cognitive and motor behavior (e.g., Leggio et al.  ; Molinari et al.  ), and automatization (Balsters and Ramnani  ; Ramnani  ). Indeed, given that the cerebellum is characterized by a rather uniform neuroarchitecture, and given the existence of closed cerebro-cerebellar input\u2013output loops (Middleton and Strick  ; Strick et al.  ), the idea of uniform cerebellar computations and overarching functions is very enticing. However, this idea has recently been challenged by the proposal of multiple functionality, i.e., the idea that the same underlying circuits may implement functionally distinct computations that may also differ across domains (Diedrichsen et al.  ). Of course, this idea is not necessarily incompatible with the notion of overarching cerebellar functions, because the specific role of the cerebellar circuits could potentially change during brain development, and it is also possible that a universal cerebellar transform cannot be adequately captured in the proposed functional terms (Diedrichsen et al.  ). In any case, the debate about universal and multiple functionality illustrates that the question of how the cerebellum contributes particularly to non-motor functions warrants further investigation. \n\nOne of the most extensively studied non-motor functions of the cerebellum is verbal working memory, i.e., the ability to temporary store and manipulate verbal information. According to Baddeley\u2019s multi-component model (Baddeley  ), working memory comprises a \u201ccentral executive\u201d that serves as a supervisory module controlling the flow of information to the subordinate phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad which serve to temporarily rehearse and manipulate verbal and visual information, respectively. The model was later amended with an episodic buffer that links information across domains and with long-term and semantic memory (Baddeley  ). Previous neuroimaging studies on the role of the cerebellum for verbal working memory have revealed that specific cerebellar subregions are differentially involved in encoding and maintenance/rehearsal. Activation in a superior region localized in lobule VI and Crus I during stimulus encoding that occurs in concert with activation in posterior frontal cortex has been linked to articulatory control (Chein and Fiez  ; Chen and Desmond  ,  ), while activation in an inferior region in lobules VIII and VIIB has been associated with phonological storage (Chen and Desmond  ; Desmond et al.  ). \n\nImportantly, neuroimaging investigations of cerebellar engagement in verbal working memory have allowed scientists to empirically test different hypotheses about the precise role of the cerebellum. For instance, a study that combined eye tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Peterburs et al.  ) clarified that cerebellar activations during encoding in a verbal working memory task cannot be attributed to oculomotor behavior, as had been proposed based on fronto-cerebellar connectivity patterns (Doron et al.  ). Moreover, recent findings suggest that the cerebellum may contribute to phonological storage by predictive processes: maintenance-related inferior cerebellar activations were shown to be sensitive to repeating stimulus sequences (Peterburs et al.  ). Another theory of overarching cerebellar function states that the cerebellum is involved in perceptual processes (a comprehensive overview of converging evidence for this notion is provided in a consensus paper, Baumann et al.  ) and particularly in sensory acquisition, i.e., the extraction and primary processing of sensory information from the environment. Specifically, it has been proposed that the cerebellum ameliorates the efficiency with which other brain regions perform their respective functions by monitoring and adjusting sensory data acquisition (Bower  ). This notion is supported by cerebellar activation in response to cutaneous stimulation in the absence of motor output, increased cerebellar activation when there is tactile discrimination demand, and by even more pronounced cerebellar activation when tactile discrimination is combined with motor activity (Parsons et al.  ). \n\nThe question arises if the cerebellum is also involved in sensory acquisition outside of the tactile domain. A previous meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies on auditory processing revealed that specific cerebellar regions, here most notably left lateral Crus I, were activated consistently in a range of auditory tasks (Petacchi et al.  ), which supports a general auditory function of the cerebellum that likely relates to sensory acquisition. Findings of impaired pitch discrimination in patients with cerebellar degeneration and a strong relationship between clinical ataxia scores (reflecting the extent of the cerebellar damage) and pitch discrimination deficits also corroborate this notion (Parsons et al.  ). Moreover, activation in left Crus I was shown to scale with perceptual demands in a task that required discrimination of both visual and auditory motion signals from noise, indicating that this region may be a supramodal sensory processing region (Baumann and Mattingley  ). \n\nIf the cerebellum is indeed involved in sensory acquisition, taxing (visual) sensory acquisition demand in a verbal working memory task should modulate the associated cerebellar activations. More specifically, load-dependent cerebellar activations during stimulus encoding in a verbal working memory task should be sensitive to a manipulation of stimulus quality. The present study tested this hypothesis using degraded and non-degraded letter stimuli in a variant of the Sternberg task (Sternberg  ). Cognitive load-dependent regions of interest (ROIs) in the cerebellum were identified and tested for greater activation for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli.\u00a0In keeping with the notion that load-dependent cerebellar activations may reflect high- vs low-load differences in sensory acquisition demand, we hypothesized that increased difficulty in sensory data acquisition should elicit greater activations. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nThe present study was part of a larger investigation of cerebellar contributions to verbal working memory and presents follow-up analyses of data reported in a previous study (Peterburs et al.  ). Importantly, this earlier study investigated whether cerebellar activation during encoding could be related to eye movements and oculomotor processing, while the present work was specifically focused on elucidating sensory acquisition functions of the cerebellum. To this end, the present study presents novel analyses of the previously unanalyzed factor stimulus quality (see task description below for details). \n\n### Subjects \n  \nFifteen healthy adult volunteers (10 women, 5 men) were recruited from the Baltimore community by public advertisement and on social media. Mean age was 31.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.4\u00a0years, ages ranged 22\u201354\u00a0years. All subjects were native English speakers, right-handed according to self-report, and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Exclusion criteria included a history of neurological or psychiatric illness or head trauma, current medication affecting the central nervous system, and the following criteria pertaining to MRI scanning: claustrophobia, implanted electric or ferromagnetic devices, and pregnancy. Mean educational attainment was 18.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0years (range: 15\u201321). All subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation and received monetary compensation for participation and travel expenses. The study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. \n\n\n### Sternberg verbal working memory task \n  \nThe experimental task was a variant of the Sternberg task (Sternberg  ). In each trial, subjects had to keep a briefly presented set of consonants in memory by rehearsal until a probe letter was presented, and to then indicate by button press whether this probe matched one of letters in the initially presented set. The Sternberg task can be divided into discrete phases of stimulus encoding, maintenance, and retrieval which differ in terms of sensory and motor demands. The present variant of the task used normal and degraded stimulus quality (see Fig.\u00a0 ) to tax sensory acquisition demand (please see below for behavioral findings from a supplementary study that confirmed increased sensory acquisition demand for the present degraded compared to the non-degraded stimuli). To tax oculomotor demand, stimulus spacing was varied in two levels (close or wide). Luminance was equated for all stimuli. To manipulate cognitive and articulatory load, two and four letter consonant sets were used. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 , percent sign (%) placeholders were displayed in unused positions in the consonant sets with only two letters. As mentioned in the previous study (Peterburs et al.  ), the task also included overt and covert rehearsal instructions at the beginning of each trial. However, since sensory acquisition was expected to only affect the encoding phase, trials were pooled across rehearsal conditions for the present analyses. In addition, trials were also pooled across stimulus spacing conditions.   \nSchematic illustration of the sequence and time course of stimulus presentation in a trial of the Sternberg verbal working memory task \n  \n\nFigure\u00a0  illustrates the sequence and time course of stimulus presentation in one trial of the Sternberg task. Each trial started with a fixation cross that was presented for 3\u20135\u00a0s (which implemented jitter in trial onsets for fMRI analysis), followed by a set of two or four consonants that was presented for 2\u00a0s (encoding phase). A blank screen was presented in the maintenance phase for 4 or 6\u00a0s, while subjects were rehearsing the consonants. Last, the probe was presented for 3\u00a0s, and subjects decided whether it was a \u201cmatch\u201d or \u201cno match\u201d by pressing one of two response buttons with their right index or middle finger. Task instructions emphasized both speed and accuracy, and accordingly, response time (RT) and accuracy were recorded for each trial. Subjects completed 10 practice trials outside the scanner prior to starting the experiment. The task consisted of three runs with 64 trials each, amounting to 192 trials in total. Stimulus quality (degraded or normal), spacing (wide or close), and cognitive load (high or low) were balanced in each run. Trial order within each run was pseudorandomized so that presentation of identical parameters was limited to three consecutive trials. Each run contained 24 unique match and 24 unique no-match trials as well as 16 trials without a probe. The latter were included to allow the hemodynamic response to fully return to baseline following the maintenance phase. In these trials, a blank screen was presented in the retrieval phase, and no response was expected. For trials with probe, positions of the target letter in the initial sequences were counterbalanced. Task completion took approximately 55\u00a0min and included short breaks between runs. \n\nStimulus presentation was controlled with E-Prime 2 software (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Sharpsburg, PA, USA) running on a Hewlett Packard xw4300 workstation. The visual display was rear-projected onto a screen in the MRI scanner located behind the participant and then reflected onto a mirror fixed to the head coil within the participant\u2019s immediate line of view. Responses were recorded using two Velcro-connected fiber optic button boxes (MRA, Inc., Washington, PA). \n\n\n### Behavioral test of increased sensory acquisition demand by degraded stimuli \n  \nTo directly test whether degraded stimuli were producing increases in sensory processing, a behavioral pilot experiment was conducted with a sample of 16 healthy adult volunteers. Subjects completed a target detection task in each trial of which they received a lowercase target letter, followed immediately by one of the four types of visual stimuli that had been presented during the fMRI verbal working memory task described above. The subject's task was to simply indicate as rapidly as possible whether or not the uppercase version of the target letter appeared among the four items of the consonant set. The increase in reaction time (RT) needed to make this decision for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli was used to assess the increase in sensory acquisition demand. Two stimulus lists were created such that the letters that were degraded in list 1 were non-degraded in list 2 and vice versa. Half of the subjects (  n  \u2009=\u20098) received list 1 and the other half received list 2. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the within-subject factors load (2 letters or 4 letters) and stimulus quality (degraded or non-degraded) revealed only a significant main effect of stimulus quality [F[1, 15] \u2009=\u200960.269,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001], with mean RT values of 799\u2009\u00b1\u200939\u00a0ms for degraded stimuli and 716\u2009\u00b1\u200933\u00a0ms for non-degraded stimuli. These results support the notion that visual degradation significantly increased sensory processing. \n\n\n### Recording of eye movements during the task \n  \nEye movements were recorded during scanning with an Arrington Research (Scottsdale, AZ, USA) MR-compatible infrared eye tracker and the ViewPoint  user interface at a sampling rate of 60\u00a0Hz. The camera was fixed to the scanner cot just outside the head coil with a flexible mount and pointed towards the left eye. Gaze point coordinates were recorded as relative position on the screen, [0, 0] reflecting the upper left and the lower right corner. Prior to the first task run, a nine-point auto-calibration procedure as implemented in ViewPoint  software was applied. Here, calibration points were presented at nine equidistant locations in the stimulus display in randomized order, and subjects were instructed to foveate on each point. After all points had been presented, the recorded locations were superimposed on a 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093 grid and visually checked for calibration quality. Calibration accuracy was determined based on the grid\u2019s geometry: a rectilinear configuration indicated successful calibration. If the grid was distorted, single calibration points were re-presented to improve calibration. \n\nEye movement data were analyzed off-line using MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA). First, data were segmented according to the onset of encoding phase of each trial. Next, these segments were scanned for blink-related and other artifacts by calculating the mean and standard deviation (SD) for pupil width and by then removing data points for which pupil width fell 2 SDs above or below the mean. This procedure was applied because we assumed that pronounced pupil dilatation changes were unlikely given that lighting was consistent during MR scanning and throughout the entire duration of the experimental task. Consequently, rapid large changes in pupil width should reflect blinks (which cause the pupil to be temporarily covered by the eye lid) or scanner-related distortions which could temporarily disrupt the eye tracker\u2019s pupil detection algorithm, resulting in incorrect gaze coordinates. Next, point-to-point absolute distances between data points were calculated and summed separately for x and y gaze point coordinates, yielding quantitative horizontal (x) and vertical (y) eye movement parameters for each trial. These parameters thus reflected the average cumulative distance the eyes \u201ctravelled\u201d per trial/volume. Larger values reflected more eye movement, irrespective of direction or type of movement. For example, scores close to one for horizontal eye movement indicated that the eyes traveled a distance equivalent to the length of the stimulus display. Quantitative eye movement parameters were also determined for each volume acquired during scanning to generate an eye movement regressor to be included in the functional MRI analysis (see below for details). \n\n\n### Analysis of working memory behavioral data \n  \nAccuracy, RT, and quantitative eye movement parameters obtained during fMRI scanning were analyzed with separate 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with   load   (high or low) and   stimulus quality   (non-degraded or degraded) as within-subject factors. Post hoc   t   tests were performed to resolve interactions. The significance level was set to   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition and analysis \n  \nMRI data were acquired using a 3.0\u00a0T Philips Intera scanner (Philips, Eindhoven, NL). The structural MRI protocol consisted of a T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (TR\u2009=\u20096.97\u00a0ms; TE\u2009=\u20093.3\u00a0ms; TI\u2009=\u2009982\u00a0ms; flip angle\u2009=\u20098\u00b0, in-plane resolution\u2009=\u20090.75\u00a0mm; slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u00a0mm; 170 sagittal slices; FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u00a0mm; 1 NEX). Functional MRI data were collected using three T2*-weighted gradient echo EPI pulse sequences (TR\u2009=\u20091000\u00a0ms; TE\u2009=\u200930\u00a0ms; flip angle\u2009=\u200961\u00b0; in-plane resolution\u2009=\u20092.75\u00a0mm; slice thickness\u2009=\u20096\u00a0mm, gap\u2009=\u20091\u00a0mm; 20 oblique-axial slices; FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u00a0mm; 1 NEX). Images were acquired in the oblique-axial plane rotated 25\u00b0 clockwise with respect to the AC-PC line to optimize imaging of the cerebellum and neocortex. Application of a 1000\u00a0ms TR, jittered trial onsets, variable duration in the maintenance phase, and no-probe trials has been used previously to analyze the separate encoding, maintenance and retrieval phases of the task, and simulations confirmed that voxels responding to any combination of the three task phases could be identified (Chen and Desmond  ). The number of acquired volumes within each of the three runs ranged from 944\u2013953. The start of the fMRI scan was synchronized with the start of each experimental run using E-prime software (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Sharpsburg, PA, USA). \n\nSPM8 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) was used for preprocessing and statistical computations. Standard image preprocessing steps were performed: slice timing correction (reference\u2009=\u2009middle slice), motion correction, anatomical co-registration, normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotaxic space, spatial smoothing (FWHM\u2009=\u20095\u00a0mm). Normalization was performed based on gray and white matter segmentation as implemented in SPM. This procedure involves combining registration to standardized space and tissue classification (as gray matter, white matter, or cerebrospinal fluid) in a single generative model that includes parameters for volume intensity non-uniformity (Ashburner and Friston  ). This procedure has been shown to yield cerebellar output that closely corresponds to that of SUIT (as opposed to the SPM default non-linear normalization method, see Diedrichsen et al.  ). \n\n\n### First-level fMRI analysis \n  \nIndividual statistical maps were computed for each subject using the general linear model approach as implemented in SPM8, with high-pass filtering of 128\u00a0s. Since the present investigation focused on whether sensory acquisition processes could be responsible for working memory load-dependent activations, fMRI analysis was focused on the encoding phase of the task, but the other task phases (maintenance and retrieval) were nevertheless also modelled in the GLM, as were the high vs low load and degraded vs non-degraded trial types. Thus, because there were two load conditions, two stimulus quality conditions, and trials were divided into three phases, each scan had a total of 12 task-related regressors for first-level analysis. The duration of these regressors was 2\u00a0s for the encoding phase, 4 or 6\u00a0s for the maintenance phase, and 3\u00a0s for the retrieval phase. For no-probe trials, the retrieval phase was omitted. For fMRI analyses, these regressors were convolved with the SPM canonical hemodynamic response function. Only correct trials were modelled, given that overall performance accuracy was very high (94.5%). Additional regressors of no interest for each scan included motion parameters computed from motion correction and artifacts identified with Artifact Detection Tools (ART;  ), a toolbox for fMRI post-processing optimized for artifact removal. Because each subject completed three scans total for the fMRI session, the GLM for first-stage analysis included all three scans, and contrasts were pooled across these scans. Contrasts of interest that were included in the second-stage (random effects) analysis were specific to the encoding phase and included working memory load (high\u2013low), stimulus quality (degraded\u2013non-degraded), and the load x stimulus quality interaction. These were each implemented as   t   test contrasts. \n\n\n### Second-level fMRI analysis \n  \nSecond-level (random effects) analyses were performed by computing (from the first level analysis) one contrast volume per subject for the working memory load, stimulus quality, and load \u00d7 quality interaction contrasts, and then using these volumes to calculate one-sample   t   test values at every voxel (testing the null hypothesis that the contrast value was 0). Because behavioral analyses indicated that eye movements\u2019 differences during the encoding phases of degraded vs non-degraded stimulus trials approached significance, in the fMRI second-level analysis of the degraded\u2013non-degraded contrast, trial-wise eye movement parameters were included as a co-variate. The analysis strategy at group level was to first identify cerebellar activations in left and right hemispheral lobule VI/Crus I and vermis, which have been shown to exhibit a significant working memory load effect (high\u2009>\u2009low) in previous studies (Chen and Desmond  ,  ; Desmond et al.  ). We identified these clusters in the designated regions using a voxel-wise significance level of   p  \u2009<\u20090.005. These clusters were used to create activation-defined regions of interest (ROIs), consisting of all contiguous voxels that reached the   p   value threshold. Further analyses of stimulus quality were conducted on these ROIs using a small volume correction (voxel-wise   p  \u2009<\u20090.005 threshold, peak FWE-corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, we performed FWE-corrected (voxel-wise   p  \u2009<\u20090.005 threshold, peak FWE-corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05) whole brain analysis of the stimulus quality effect (degraded\u2009>\u2009non-degraded), and subsequently analyzed the load effect (high\u2009>\u2009low) in brain regions that showed greater activation for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli. To further examine if additional regions of the brain were responsive to both sensory acquisition demand and working memory load, we performed an additional conjunction analysis in which voxels that were significant for both load and stimulus quality contrasts (at a voxel-wise   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 to maximize potential regions of overlap) were identified. We then examined peak activation within these clusters to identify all conjunction regions in which peak activation within the cluster exceeded   p  \u2009<\u20090.005 for both the load contrast and for the stimulus quality contrast. \n\nMNI coordinates of activation peaks were transformed into the coordinate system of the Talairach and Tourneaux stereotaxic atlas (Talairach et al.  ) using the MNI to Talairach transformation described by Lancaster et al. ( ) to make anatomical determinations of the neocortical activations (which were verified by manual inspection). However, MNI coordinates are reported in tables and figures. For the cerebellum, MNI coordinates were referenced with the SUIT atlas (Diedrichsen et al.  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral data \n  \nMean percentages of correct responses according to load and stimulus quality are provided in Fig.\u00a0 a. For accuracy, the ANOVA yielded a significant main effect of load (F[1, 14] =\u20097.492,   p  \u2009=\u20090.016), indicating that response accuracy was higher for trials with low (mean\u2009=\u200995.74%, SE\u2009=\u20090.57) relative to high cognitive load (mean\u2009=\u200993.33%, SE\u2009=\u20090.69). Moreover, there was a trend for a main effect of stimulus quality F[1, 14]\u2009=\u20093.276,   p  \u2009=\u20090.092), reflecting slightly better performance for non-degraded (mean\u2009=\u200995.27%, SE\u2009=\u20090.62) compared to degraded stimuli (mean\u2009=\u200993.80%, SE\u2009=\u20090.60). The load x stimulus quality interaction failed to reach significance (  p  \u2009=\u20090.395).   \nWorking memory behavioral results.

The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of load (F[1, 14] =\u200960.188,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), with longer RTs when cognitive load was high (mean\u2009=\u2009836\u00a0ms, SE\u2009=\u200934) compared to low (mean\u2009=\u2009720\u00a0ms, SE\u2009=\u200930). No other effects reached statistical significance (all   p  \u2019s\u2009>\u20090.461). \n\nEye movement means according to load and stimulus quality are provided in Fig.\u00a0 c. Note that scores close to one for horizontal eye movement (as observed in the present task) suggest that the eyes traveled a distance equivalent to the length of the whole stimulus display which ranged from positional coordinate [0] for the left side to [1] for the right side. Eye movement analysis did not reveal any significant main effects or interactions (all   p  \u2019s\u2009>\u20090.274), although there was a trend for a significant main effect of stimulus quality (F[1, 14]\u2009=\u20092.974,   p  \u2009=\u20090.107), pointing towards more movement for degraded (mean\u2009=\u20090.89, SE\u2009=\u20090.12) relative to non-degraded stimuli (mean\u2009=\u20090.86, SE\u2009=\u20090.11). \n\n\n### Imaging data \n  \nBOLD signal changes for the load effect were observed in mainly three cerebellar regions. Left hemispheral lobule VI, right hemispheral lobule VI, and vermis Crus II (see Fig.\u00a0  and Table  ) all showed greater activation for high compared to low load. Subsequent analysis of stimulus quality effects in these load-dependent activation-defined cerebellar ROIs yielded significantly increased activation for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli only in vermis Crus II (see Fig.\u00a0 ), but no interaction of load and stimulus quality was observed.   \nPositive cerebellar activations for high vs low cognitive load (high\u2009>\u2009low).   p  \u2009<\u20090.005 uncorrected.

Consistent with the behavioral results found from our initial test of increased sensory acquisition demand by degraded stimuli (i.e., increased RT for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli), greater activation for degraded vs non-degraded stimuli was found in a cluster in the left fusiform gyrus and a cluster in right inferior occipital gyrus, further indicating that the degradation manipulation had indeed increased sensory acquisition demand (see Fig.\u00a0  and Table  ). Using the respective activation-defined ROIs in left fusiform gyrus and right inferior occipital gyrus as ROIs, subsequent analyses of load identified only a small cluster in left fusiform gyrus that showed greater activation for high relative to low load; there were no suprathreshold clusters in the right inferior occipital region. However, fusiform activations were much more extensive for the stimulus quality effect than for the load effect.   \nStimulus quality effect (degraded\u2009>\u2009non-degraded; whole brain, FWE-corrected,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05) in left fusiform gyrus and right inferior occipital gyrus (upper panel), and load effect (high\u2009>\u2009low) in a small cluster in left fusiform gyrus (lower panel).   Inf Occip Gyr   inferior occipital gyrus,   Fusiform gyr   fusiform gyrus \n  \n\nThe conjunction analysis of working memory load and stimulus quality revealed only three regions in which peak activity in the conjunction region reached   p  \u2009<\u20090.005 for both contrasts, the left fusiform gyrus region shown in Fig.\u00a0 , the Vermis Crus II region shown in Figs.\u00a0 ,  , and a 900\u00a0mm  region in the left middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann Area 6) located at MNI coordinates -34, 0, 46 using the load contrast peak, and at coordinates -36, 2, 46 using the stimulus quality contrast peak. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study investigated whether cerebellar activations in a verbal working memory task were modulated by perceptual demands. In line with the a priori hypothesis, and in support of sensory acquisition as a general function of the cerebellum, load-dependent activations in vermis Crus II scaled with sensory acquisition demand and were increased for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli. In contrast, activations in bilateral hemispheral lobule VI, which were also increased for high compared to low cognitive load, were unaffected by stimulus quality. In general, this result pattern suggests that the cerebellar hemispheres are involved in articulatory processing and representation, while perceptual processes related to the prediction of visual stimuli from partial representations occur in the vermis. Of note, cerebellar activations in the present study cannot be attributed to motor effects since eye movements were used as covariates in the analysis. \n\nThe remarkably uniform neuroarchitecture of the cerebellum and the identification of distinct reciprocal loops that connect different cerebellar regions to distinct motor and cognitive regions in the neocortex (Middleton and Strick  ; Strick et al.  ) have inspired a search for overarching, domain-independent functions of the cerebellum. To date, a range of such functions have been proposed, e.g., prediction and internal models (Ito  ; Wolpert et al.  ), general functions of performance monitoring (Peterburs and Desmond  ), automatization (Balsters and Ramnani  ), timing (Ivry  ), and sensory acquisition (Bower  ). The present study was aimed to further investigate the notion that the cerebellum is involved in perceptual processes (Baumann et al.  ), and here specifically sensory acquisition. A Sternberg verbal working memory task was used because this type of task has been shown to reliably produce robust cerebellar activation patterns that inform about distinct functional roles of specific cerebellar subregions (e.g., Chen and Desmond  ,  ; Desmond et al.  ). Since sensory acquisition processes are most critical during initial stimulus encoding, data analysis in the present study focused on the encoding phase of the Sternberg task. In accordance with previous findings (Chein and Fiez  ; Chen and Desmond  ,  ; Kirschen et al.  ), cognitive load, i.e., the number of letters to be encoded into an articulatory code, modulated activations bilaterally in the cerebellar hemispheres in lobule VI. In previous studies, activations in right lobule VI occurred concordant with activations in left inferior frontal cortex, linking them to articulatory representations (Chein and Fiez  ; Chen and Desmond  ). \n\nInterestingly, in the present study, a smaller region in vermis Crus II was also sensitive to the load effect, with increased activation for high relative to low load. Importantly, activations in this region were also modulated by stimulus quality: in line with our a priori hypothesis, degraded stimuli that required more sensory processing than non-degraded stimuli, as confirmed by increased RTs in a separate behavioral test of the stimuli, were associated with increased activation. These effects of load and stimulus quality on activity in vermis Crus II are particularly interesting, because this area was shown to both receive projections from area 46 (middle frontal gyrus/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and project back to this area (rather than to M1 or oculomotor regions) in a primate neurophysiology study using neurotropic virus tracing in macaques (Kelly and Strick  ). Human area 46 and macaque area 46 were also shown to closely match in terms of cortical functional connectivity in a later study (Neubert et al.  ), corroborating the notion of functional correspondence. Importantly, area 46 has been implicated in working memory for different types of stimuli in a large number of studies (for a meta-analysis of fMRI studies, see Owen et al.  ), and the present findings of memory load and stimulus quality effects in a cerebellar region densely connected to area 46 are well in line with this. \n\nApart from vermis Crus II, increased activation for degraded relative to non-degraded stimuli was also found in the visual cortex in right inferior occipital gyrus and left fusiform gyrus. The left fusiform gyrus also showed load-dependent activation differences, albeit to a much lesser degree than the modulation by stimulus quality. Overall, this result pattern is consistent with increased sensory and attentional demand for degraded compared to non-degraded stimuli. Of note, adjacent vermal regions of lobule VI have been linked to processing of visual motion cues (Baumann and Mattingley  ) as well as biological motion based on point-light animations (e.g., Ferrari et al.  ), while vermis lobule VII/Crus II has been associated with processing of emotionally salient stimuli (for a review, see Stoodley and Schmahmann  ). \n\nInterestingly, conjunction analysis identified (in addition to vermis Crus II and left fusiform gyrus) a small region in left middle frontal gyrus (BA 6) that was also responsive to manipulations of both load and stimulus quality. Prior work has linked BA 6 to executive processes during maintenance and thus monitoring and manipulation demands (e.g., Wager and Smith  ; Nee et al.  ). Previous studies from our lab (Desmond et al.  ; Chen and Desmond  ,  ) have linked superior cerebellar activation to posterior frontal activations associated with the articulatory control system of the Baddeley model of verbal working memory (Baddeley  ,  ). The present results extend these findings and suggest that a BA6-vermis crus II circuit could sub-serve both working memory load and sensory acquisition demands. \n\nIn general, increased activations for decreased signal strength (and hence increased sensory demand) have previously been reported in a task in which visual and auditory motion had to be distinguished from noise (Baumann and Mattingley  ). It has been proposed that cerebellar input is used to ameliorate processing/signal acquisition in sensory regions, e.g., by facilitating computational efficiency and providing sensory data control (Bower  ). This notion was based on early fMRI investigations in the tactile domain that disentangled mere finger movement control from the use of the fingers as sensory devices (Gao et al.  ). Specifically, it was shown that activation in the dentate nucleus, the sole output node for the cerebellar hemispheres, was greater for sensory discrimination tasks with and without movement than for a task involving finger movement not associated with tactile sensory discrimination. In the auditory domain, a meta-analysis of 15 studies showed consistent cerebellar activations across a range of different simple auditory tasks that could not be attributed to attentional demand (Petacchi et al.  ), thus supporting a role for the cerebellum in auditory sensory processing that is consistent with the sensory acquisition hypothesis. In line with this, patients with cerebellar degenerative disease relative to healthy control subjects show impaired pitch discrimination despite normal hearing thresholds and similar performance in control tasks involving sustained attention and verbal auditory working memory (Parsons et al.  ). Aside from these empirical findings, a role for the cerebellum in sensory acquisition is also supported by evolutionary considerations. Paulin ( ) provided several examples of species in which lobular expansion in the cerebellum seems to track sensory demands better than motor demands. For example, echolocating microbats and whales (which have different motor requirements, i.e., bats use distal muscles for movement whereas whales use axial muscles) show similar expansion in vermal lobule VIII that is not seen in non-echolocating bats and whales. Paulin therefore proposed that the cerebellum may serve as a tracking system that is important for the control and coordination of movements which requires that moving objects as well as own movements are tracked and that sensory consequences of movements are analyzed appropriately. Importantly, the cerebellar association with passive echolocation and passive electrolocation is analogous to that found for active sensory systems, indicating that cerebellar sensory acquisition functions are not dependent on movement (Paulin  ). Along these lines, in the present working memory task with visual stimuli, it is conceivable that cerebellar input may be used to improve the prediction of stimulus identity when stimuli are degraded. This would be consistent with the notion of cerebellar internal models and predictive functions (Ito  ; Wolpert et al.  ). \n\nThe cerebellar role in sensory acquisition yields interesting implications for processes of learning and expertise-building. A very recent study revealed a pattern of reduced cerebellar activation that accompanied higher sensory cortical activity in experienced archery athletes. In contrast, in non-athletic control participants, visual activations were found to co-occur with extensive cerebellar activation (Lo et al.  ). This result pattern appears to suggest that cerebellar sensory data control may be needed less when expertise is high, i.e., when sensory processing is already optimized. Future studies should investigate if this also applies to other non-motor functions. \n\nTo conclude, the present findings provide partial support for the sensory acquisition hypothesis and point to an overall function of association-based prediction that may underlie general cerebellar function, with perceptual prediction of stimuli from partial representations occurring in vermal and articulatory prediction occurring in hemispheral regions. Such a function is well in line with performance monitoring accounts of cerebellar function and with the generation of internal models for both motor and non-motor functions. On the other hand, the idea of an overarching cerebellar function has been challenged by the proposal of cerebellar multiple functionality (Diedrichsen et al.  ). Along these lines, the regional non-uniformity of function observed in the present study (i.e., load but not sensory acquisition sensitivity of the cerebellar hemispheres) could also be viewed as evidence supporting cerebellar multiple functionality. More research is therefore needed to unravel the specific nature of the cerebellar involvement in well-defined task domains. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nBrain region\tX\tY\tZ\tSPM (Z)\tSize (mm3)\nSignificant cerebellar activations for high\u2009>\u2009low load during encoding\tSignificant cerebellar activations for high\u2009>\u2009low load during encoding\tSignificant cerebellar activations for high\u2009>\u2009low load during encoding\tSignificant cerebellar activations for high\u2009>\u2009low load during encoding\tSignificant cerebellar activations for high\u2009>\u2009low load during encoding\tSignificant cerebellar activations for high\u2009>\u2009low load during encoding\nLeft hemispheral lobule VI\t\u2212 12\t\u2212 62\t\u2212 26\t3.30\t1006\nRight hemispheral lobule VI\t16\t\u2212 64\t\u2212 28\t2.95\t2330\nVermis crus II\t0\t\u2212 74\t\u2212 28\t2.73\t371\nRight hemispheral lobule VIIb\t32\t\u2212 70\t\u2212 52\t2.90\t53\nSignificant activation for degraded\u2009>\u2009non-degraded in load-defined cerebellar ROIs\tSignificant activation for degraded\u2009>\u2009non-degraded in load-defined cerebellar ROIs\tSignificant activation for degraded\u2009>\u2009non-degraded in load-defined cerebellar ROIs\tSignificant activation for degraded\u2009>\u2009non-degraded in load-defined cerebellar ROIs\tSignificant activation for degraded\u2009>\u2009non-degraded in load-defined cerebellar ROIs\tSignificant activation for degraded\u2009>\u2009non-degraded in load-defined cerebellar ROIs\nVermis crus II\t\u2212 2\t\u2212 74\t\u2212 28\t2.60\t53\nSignificant extra-cerebellar activations for degraded\u2009>\u2009non-degraded during encoding\tSignificant extra-cerebellar activations for degraded\u2009>\u2009non-degraded during encoding\tSignificant extra-cerebellar activations for degraded\u2009>\u2009non-degraded during encoding\tSignificant extra-cerebellar activations for degraded\u2009>\u2009non-degraded during encoding\tSignificant extra-cerebellar activations for degraded\u2009>\u2009non-degraded during encoding\tSignificant extra-cerebellar activations for degraded\u2009>\u2009non-degraded during encoding\nLeft fusiform gyrus\t\u2212 36\t\u2212 72\t\u2212 12\t5.82\t69,295\nRight inferior occipital gyrus\t40\t\u2212 74\t\u2212 4\t4.94\t80,148\nSignificant activation for high\u2009>\u2009low load in stimulus quality- defined extra-cerebellar ROIs\tSignificant activation for high\u2009>\u2009low load in stimulus quality- defined extra-cerebellar ROIs\tSignificant activation for high\u2009>\u2009low load in stimulus quality- defined extra-cerebellar ROIs\tSignificant activation for high\u2009>\u2009low load in stimulus quality- defined extra-cerebellar ROIs\tSignificant activation for high\u2009>\u2009low load in stimulus quality- defined extra-cerebellar ROIs\tSignificant activation for high\u2009>\u2009low load in stimulus quality- defined extra-cerebellar ROIs\nLeft fusiform gyrus\t\u2212 36\t\u2212 74\t\u2212 4\t3.62\t4129\n### Caption\nMNI coordinates of activation maxima for the cerebellar load effect (voxel-wise p\u2009<\u20090.005 threshold uncorr), the stimulus quality effect in load-dependent cerebellar ROIs (small volume corrected, voxel-wise p\u2009<\u20090.005 threshold, peak FWE-corrected p\u2009<\u20090.05), the extra-cerebellar stimulus quality effect (whole brain, voxel-wise p\u2009<\u20090.005 threshold, peak FWE-corrected, p\u2009<\u20090.05), and for the load-effect in stimulus-quality dependent extra-cerebellar ROIs (small volume corrected, voxel-wise p\u2009<\u20090.005 threshold, peak FWE-corrected p\u2009<\u20090.05)\n### Footer\nNone\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7981326, "text_md5": "43e5b98b4e34740021acd57734504290", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 73], "journal": [74, 92], "publication_year": [94, 98], "title": [109, 181], "keywords": [195, 264], "abstract": [277, 1936], "body": [1945, 42149], "tables": [42162, 45171]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 33481104, "doi": "10.1007/s00429-020-02212-5", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981326", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7981326"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981326\">7981326</a>", "list_title": "PMC7981326  Sensory acquisition functions of the cerebellum in verbal working memory"}

The fact that the FG and pSTS are frequently co-activated suggests that they may interact synergistically in a distributed face processing network. Alternatively, the functions implemented by these regions may be encapsulated from each other. It has proven difficult to evaluate these two accounts during visual processing of face stimuli. However, if the FG and pSTS interact during face processing, the substrate for such interactions may be apparent in a correlation of the BOLD timeseries from these two regions during periods of rest when no faces are present. To examine face-specific resting correlations, we developed a new partial functional connectivity approach in which we removed variance from the FG that was shared with other category-selective and control regions. The remaining   face-specific   FG resting variance was then used to predict resting signals throughout the brain. In two experiments, we observed face-specific resting functional connectivity between FG and pSTS, and importantly, these correlations overlapped precisely with the face-specific pSTS region obtained from independent localizer runs. Additional region-of-interest and pattern analyses confirmed that the FG\u2013pSTS resting correlations were face-specific. These findings support a model in which face processing is distributed among a finite number of connected, but nevertheless face-specialized regions. The discovery of category-specific interactions in the absence of visual input suggests that resting networks may provide a latent foundation for task processing. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFaces are one of the most important sources of information in the visual environment. They allow us to identify friend from foe, and to interpret the mental states of others. Given this importance, it is no surprise that the brain has evolved specialized mechanisms for processing faces. In fMRI, for example, faces selectively activate several ventral and lateral occipitotemporal cortical regions, most prominently the fusiform gyrus (FG), and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). \n\nFocal regions within the FG respond more strongly to faces than to other stimulus categories, such as words, buildings, and objects (Puce et al.,  ; Kanwisher et al.,  ; McCarthy et al.,  ; also known by the functional label: fusiform face area, or FFA). More specifically, the FG may be involved in the processing of facial identity (Winston et al.,  ; Rotshtein et al.,  ). For example, adaptation in the FG to a morphed face is released only to a new morph that crosses an identity boundary (Rotshtein et al.,  ). Neuropsychological studies of prosopagnosia further implicate the FG in identity recognition (Barton et al.,  ), and subdural stimulation of FG sites results in transient prosopagnosia and visual face hallucinations (Allison et al.,  ; Puce et al.,  ). \n\nThe pSTS is also routinely observed in fMRI studies of face processing (Puce et al.,  ,  ; Kanwisher et al.,  ). Compared to the FG, the functional role(s) of the pSTS and surrounding cortex have been more controversial (Hein and Knight,  ; Mitchell,  ). The pSTS has been variably associated with many functions, including the perception of biological motion (Allison et al.,  ), social perception (Saxe,  ), multisensory integration (Ghazanfar and Schroeder,  ), and spatial attention (Corbetta et al.,  ). However, here we focus on the role of the pSTS in processing socially relevant facial information, such as emotional expressions and eye gaze (Puce et al.,  ; Narumoto et al.,  ; Pelphrey et al.,  ; Engell and Haxby,  ). In addition to being activated by such stimuli, adaptation and pattern classification studies have revealed coding of specific gaze directions and expressions in the pSTS (Winston et al.,  ; Calder et al.,  ; Furl et al.,  ; Said et al.,  ). \n\nThe fact that faces activate many brain regions has led researchers to suggest that faces are processed in a distributed network (Haxby et al.,  ; Ishai,  ). In such models, the FG and pSTS are core nodes that, respectively, process invariant (identity) and changeable (expression, gaze) facial features. Going back to the cognitive roots of these theories (Bruce and Young,  ), the processing of different facial features is described as occurring independently in parallel pathways. This view is supported by dissociations between identity and expression processing (Duchaine et al.,  ; Andrews and Ewbank,  ; Fox et al.,  ). Moreover, evoked responses from subdural electrodes in both regions occur simultaneously, without a temporal offset that would provide evidence of feedback/feedforward interactions (Allison et al.,  ). Finally, face processing models in which the FG and pSTS interact provide a somewhat worse fit than purely feedforward models (Fairhall and Ishai,  ). \n\nAt the same time, the independence of the FG and pSTS has been questioned (Calder and Young,  ; Vuilleumier and Pourtois,  ). For example, the pSTS can be sensitive to both identity and expression information (Perrett et al.,  ; Hasselmo et al.,  ; Winston et al.,  ), and attention to expression information enhances the response of the FG (Vuilleumier et al.,  ; Ganel et al.,  ). Moreover, even if the computations underlying identity and expression processing (implemented by the FG and pSTS, respectively) were dissociable, interactions between the FG and pSTS may nevertheless prove essential for binding expressions and identities. Indeed, given the multidimensional role of the pSTS in processing facial expressions, eye gaze, and biological motion, it may serve a broader role in deciphering the intentions of social agents (Saxe et al.,  ; Vander Wyk et al.,  ). Thus, while faces activate several brain regions, the relationship between the FG and pSTS may be the most relevant connection in any larger network that tracks individuals and their intentions. \n\nOne of the primary challenges for assessing the interactivity/independence of the FG and pSTS is that both regions respond to faces in a correlated manner (Puce et al.,  ,  ; Kanwisher et al.,  ). Are such correlations spuriously linked to external face stimulation, or do they reflect internal dynamics within a distributed face processing network? To address this question, we tested the extent to which correlations between the FG and pSTS persist at rest in the absence of external stimulation. Indeed, resting connectivity has been used extensively to characterize cortical networks, based partly on the fact that regions that tend to be activated in unison during tasks also fluctuate in unison at rest (see Corbetta et al.,  ). \n\nIn two experiments we examined resting connectivity between the FG and pSTS. Using an independent localizer scan, we identified a right FG seed in each individual that responded selectively to faces, and an adjacent control seed in right ventral visual cortex that responded selectively to images of a different visual category (flowers or scenes in Experiment 1, scenes in Experiment 2). Using separate resting runs, we extracted the BOLD timeseries from the FG and the functional control seed, as well as from several locations in white matter and ventricles whose signal likely reflects non-functional noise and artifacts. The extracted timeseries were entered as regressors into simultaneous multiple regression models of the same resting runs. The resulting parameter estimates for the FG regressor provide a measure of   partial   functional connectivity, i.e. the degree to which the unique variance in the FG (with respect to the control region and other nuisance regressors) was reflected in other brain regions. Thus, while the resting \u201ctask\u2019\u2019 had nothing in particular to do with faces, we were able to isolate intrinsic activity that was specific to a brain region reliably activated by face stimuli. This approach allows us to observe resting connectivity throughout the whole brain, but we focus on the FG and pSTS in order to characterize the nature of this relationship in detail. \n\nMost previous studies of face-related functional connectivity have examined   changes   in connectivity across stimulus conditions (Fairhall and Ishai,  ; Rotshtein et al.,  ; Nummenmaa et al.,  ), rather than baseline intrinsic connectivity that persists at rest. The one study to directly examine face-related resting connectivity relied entirely on exploratory whole-brain analyses (Zhang et al.,  ), without expressly characterizing the specificity and functional significance of the FG\u2013pSTS resting relationship. In particular, they used a control region located in the left FG that is broadly tuned to a range of non-face stimuli and, by being located in the other hemisphere, does not account for hemispheric-specific properties of ventral temporal cortex (e.g., global/local preferences; Fink et al.,  ). Here we use partial connectivity and a combination of whole-brain, region-of-interest, and novel pattern analysis techniques to directly address whether the FG and pSTS share resting variance related to face processing. \n\nThese techniques suggest new ways to link task and resting paradigms. Whereas typical single-seed methods have included nuisance regressors for movement and other global factors (see Fox and Raichle,  ), our study provides an initial demonstration of how regressing out functional regions can reveal more selective connectivity. This partial connectivity approach may be analogous to the canonical subtraction method for assessing the specificity of task-evoked activation. In addition, the pattern analysis technique introduced in Experiment 2 uses resting connectivity to predict the response of brain regions during tasks. This allows us to explicitly test the link between task and resting activations on a region-by-region basis, i.e. by testing whether the task activation in a region can be predicted by the pattern of connectivity in that region to a distinct seed region. The ability to characterize fine-grained networks (cf. gross sensorimotor networks; e.g., Biswal et al.,  ; Lowe et al.,  ) using partial connectivity \u2013 and to link this connectivity to task activation \u2013 may move us closer to understanding the mechanisms supporting perception and cognition, even in the absence of explicit tasks. \n\n\n## Experiment 1 \n  \n### Materials and methods \n  \n#### Subjects \n  \nResting and localizer scans were obtained from two existing data sets. Resting scans were only collected in the corresponding studies if time allowed, and so only a subset of the subjects were eligible for the present analysis. We further restricted analysis to subjects for whom we could localize both a right FG seed and right control seed (we failed to localize the FG seed in three subjects and the control seed in two subjects). A total of 12 right-handed subjects with normal or corrected-to-normal vision met these criteria. They received monetary compensation for participating. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and the study protocols were approved by the Duke University Medical Center IRB. \n\n\n#### Data acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nAll data were collected at the Duke Brain Imaging and Analysis Center using a 3T Excite platform GE scanner with an eight-channel head coil. Functional data were collected using a T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with a 2000\u2009ms repetition time (TR), 30-ms echo time (TE), 60\u00b0 flip angle, and a 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 matrix. In the first data set, 34 3.8-mm slices were obtained with a 256\u2009mm FOV (4 \u00d7\u20094 \u00d7\u20093.8-mm voxels), and in the second data set, 32 3-mm slices were obtained with a 192-mm FOV (3 \u00d7\u20093 \u00d7\u20093-mm voxels). Two T1-weighted anatomical scans were also collected for spatial registration and normalization (3D and co-planar). \n\nPreprocessing and regression analyses were carried out using FSL 4.1 and FMRIB software libraries (Analysis Group, FMRIB, Oxford, UK). Seeds and regressors were defined using custom scripts for Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). For each localizer and resting scan, the first three volumes were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration. The remaining data were motion-corrected in six dimensions to the middle volume of each run, spatially smoothed using a 6-mm FWHM kernel, and temporally high-pass filtered with a 111-s period. The period of this filter allows frequencies greater than 0.009 Hz, a standard low frequency cutoff across many studies of functional connectivity (e.g., Fox et al.,  ; He et al.,  ; Shulman et al.,  ). We followed this convention, and applied these same preprocessing parameters to both resting and localizer runs. Functional runs were registered to the co-planar structural scan with three degrees of freedom (DOF), which was in turn registered to the high-resolution structural scan with six DOF. Each subject's high-resolution scan was normalized to the MNI template with 12 DOF. Using these transformations, EPI data were transformed into standard space, and interpolated to 2-mm isotropic voxels. \n\n\n#### Localizer analysis \n  \nThe six subjects in the first data set each completed three localizer runs with 186 volumes at the start of the session. Each localizer run consisted of a pseudo-randomized block design in which 16-s stimulus blocks were interleaved with 16-s blocks of fixation. A total of nine stimulus and fixation blocks were presented in every run, with three each for faces, flowers, and bodies. Stimulus blocks consisted of 16 images from a single category, and subjects were required only to watch the stimuli. The six subjects in the second data set each completed two localizer runs with 196 volumes near the end of the session. Each localizer run consisted of an alternating block design in which 24-s stimulus blocks were interleaved with 6-s blocks of fixation. A total of 12 stimulus and fixation blocks were presented in each run, including six each for faces and scenes. Stimulus blocks consisted of 12 colorful images from a single category, and subjects were required to make a male/female or an indoor/outdoor judgment to each image. \n\nAt the first level, each localizer run was fit using a general linear model (GLM) including boxcar regressors convolved with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function for face blocks and control blocks (flowers in the first data set, and scenes in the second data set). Using this GLM,   z  -scores were computed for the contrasts \u201cface\u2009> flower\u201d and \u201cflower\u2009> face\u201d in the first data set, and \u201cface\u2009> scene\u201d and \u201cscene\u2009> face\u201d in the second data set. At the second level, statistical maps were combined across runs of a given subject using a fixed-effects model. \n\nTwo seeds were defined in each subject using the second-level contrast maps. Seeds were defined separately for each subject due to the anatomical variability of the corresponding regions in past studies. This general approach is a highly conventional way to define ROIs in the ventral visual stream. First, a right FG seed was defined as the peak voxel in a cluster centered on the right mid-fusiform gyrus from the \u201cface\u2009> flower\u201d and \u201cface\u2009> scene\u201d contrasts. Second, a control seed was defined in each subject as the peak voxel in a cluster adjacent to the FG seed in the right hemisphere from the \u201cflower\u2009> face\u201d and \u201cscene\u2009> face\u201d contrasts. Flowers have been used in previous studies as a control object for face processing, and regions activated by flowers are generally responsive to most non-face objects (McCarthy et al.,  ). Scenes have been used extensively to define a category-selective region of parahippocampal cortex (PHC) in the collateral sulcus (Aguirre et al.,  ; Epstein and Kanwisher,  ; also known by the functional label: parahippocampal place area, or PPA). \n\nWhile the \u201ccontrol\u201d categories for the two data sets were different, flower- and scene-selective regions were proximal to each other and to the FG. Most importantly, the flower and scene seeds were never combined in any way: a flower seed was used as the control region for subjects in the first data set, and a scene seed was used as the control region for subjects in the second data set. We hypothesized that either region would control for generic aspects of visual processing. Moreover, we believed that our conclusions would be strengthened by showing that any patterns of FG resting connectivity did not depend on our particular choice of control region. In Experiment 2, we replicate the study in a homogenous sample of subjects using only the scene control region (i.e. PHC). \n\nThe reliability of the localizer results across subjects was assessed at the third level by combining second-level maps using FSL's standard approach for random effects analyses (FLAME1). FLAME is a more sophisticated version of the standard ordinary least square GLM in which the random effects component of the mixed effects model is estimated using Bayesian techniques (Woolrich et al.,  ). To correct for multiple comparisons, the two-stage cluster correction in FSL was used: first, an initial   z  -score threshold (  z  \u2009>\u20091.65) was applied to every voxel in order to determine which clusters entered the second stage, and then cluster significance was determined by a Gaussian random fields method based on the smoothness of the data (Poline et al.,  ; Woolrich et al.,  ). The resulting group statistical maps were cluster-thresholded to a corrected alpha of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. We only computed the third level statistical map for the second level contrasts \u201cface\u2009> flower\u201d and \u201cface\u2009> scene\u201d because we expected to obtain compatible face selective regions in both contrasts (while the reverse was not necessarily true: flower and scene regions need not overlap). Specifically, this third level group map was used to compare the locations of the face-selective pSTS region from the localizer with any pSTS region obtained from the resting functional connectivity analysis described below. \n\n\n#### Resting voxelwise analysis \n  \nIn the first data set, five subjects completed two resting runs, and one subject completed one resting run. For all but two subjects, 180 volumes were acquired in each resting run (and 196/212 volumes for the remaining two subjects). In the second data set, two subjects completed two resting runs, and four subjects completed one resting run. All resting runs in this study contained 186 volumes. Thus, in total, seven subjects completed two resting runs and five subjects completed one resting run. These runs were collected at the end of each scanning session, and subjects were instructed to fixate on a central point. \n\nTo analyze resting functional connectivity, the FG and control seeds were overlaid on the preprocessed resting data (see Figure  ). We extracted the time course of the BOLD signal from these seeds by computing a weighted-mean for each volume across voxels, with weights determined by an 8-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel centered on each seed. The resulting timeseries were then entered as regressors in a new voxelwise GLM of each resting run, with the goal of identifying voxels that share variance with the FG. \n  \n Analysis pipeline  .   (A)   Localizer runs were modeled with regressors for face blocks and control blocks (scenes or flowers in Experiment 1, scenes in Experiment 2).   (B)   The contrast of these two regressors identified two seed regions in each subject for further investigation: the right fusiform gyrus (FG), and an adjacent region of right ventral temporal cortex selective for flowers or scenes (the latter is the PHC).   (C)   Timeseries were extracted from these regions in each resting run, and entered simultaneously in a GLM of the same run (along with other nuisance regressors of no interest). \n  \nBecause the FG and control regressors (and the other nuisance regressors described below) were entered simultaneously in the GLM, only variance unique to each regressor contributed to its beta (or parameter estimate). In other words, as in standard regression, the parameter estimate associated with each regressor reflects the extent to which the unique variance in that regressor explains the variance remaining in each voxel after fitting all other regressors (Meyers et al.,  ). Essentially, this corresponds to a separate stepwise regression for each regressor in which it is entered last into the model. To further validate our approach, we explicitly orthogonalized the FG regressor with respect to other regressors before conducting the analysis and obtained identical results. Thus, the parameter estimate for the FG regressor in a particular voxel reflected the partial correlation between the resting time course of that voxel and the FG regressor, independent of the other regressors. By including a functionally defined control seed from right ventral visual cortex as a regressor, we partialed out variance in the FG related to generic visual processing and high-level object processing. We thus operationally define the residual unique FG variance as   face-specific  . \n\nTo further partial out FG variance reflecting global sources of noise, we included several other nuisance regressors that are often used in whole-brain connectivity analyses (Fox et al.,  ). These include: the global mean BOLD time course over all voxels, the six movement parameters from motion correction, the BOLD time course from four white matter seeds (bilateral anterior and posterior), the BOLD time course from four ventricle seeds (bilateral anterior and posterior), and the temporal derivatives of all nuisance regressors. Thus, each resting run was modeled at the first-level by 32 regressors (see Figure   in Appendix for an example resting run design matrix, and Figure   in Appendix for a group confusion matrix of all regressors). In addition, all resting data and regressors were bandpass filtered from .009 to\u2009.08 Hz (e.g., Fox et al.,  ). \n\nThe first level GLM was used to derive   z  -scores for the fit between each voxel and the FG regressor. At the second level, statistical maps corresponding to the partial functional connectivity with the FG were then combined across all runs for a given subject using a fixed-effects approach. The reliability of these second-level maps was assessed across subjects at the third level using a mixed-effects approach (FLAME1), and the resulting group statistical maps were cluster-thresholded (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, corrected). \n\n\n\n### Results and discussion \n  \nThe group analysis of the resting runs revealed significant FG partial functional connectivity in the right pSTS (Figure  A). Importantly, this cluster found during rest overlapped considerably with a face-selective cluster obtained from the independent localizer runs (Figure  B). Given the broad spatial variability of face-specific pSTS regions in similar analyses of evoked responses (Allison et al.,  ; Hein and Knight,  ), our results provide compelling evidence for coupling of task and resting networks. \n  \n Face-specific connectivity from Experiment 1  .   (A)   Group analysis of resting correlations with each subject's face-specific FG after removing variance from the control region.   (B)   The pSTS region that was correlated with the FG at rest overlapped with the face-selective pSTS region obtained in a group analysis of the localizer runs. \n  \nGiven our   a priori   interest in the FG and pSTS we focused our analyses on these two regions. However several other clusters of correlated activity were observed, including: left FG, lateral occipital cortex, inferior occipital gyrus, dorsal and ventral striatum, thalamus, bilateral hippocampus, and left amygdala (see Table   for coordinates). The left FG in particular serves as a sanity check due to its shared face-specific function with the right FG, and its relative anatomical distance from the right FG. In addition, clusters in orbitofrontal cortex and frontal pole were anti-correlated with the right FG seed. \n  \n Resting partial FG connectivity in Experiment 1  . \n    \n\n\n## Experiment 2 \n  \n### Materials and methods \n  \n#### Subjects \n  \nTo replicate and extend our findings of Experiment 1, we collected resting and localizer data from a new group of 18 naive subjects. All subjects were right-handed, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and received monetary compensation for participating. Informed consent was obtained from subjects, and the study protocol was approved by the Human Investigation Committee of the Yale School of Medicine. \n\n\n\n### Data acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nAll data were collected at the Yale Anlyan Center using a 3T Siemens Trio scanner with an eight-channel head coil. Functional data was collected using a T2*-weighted gradient EPI sequence with a 1500\u2009ms TR, 25\u2009ms TE, 90\u00b0 flip angle, and a 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 matrix. In a given volume, 26 5-mm slices parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line were obtained with a 224-mm FOV (3.5\u2009\u00d7\u20093.5\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009mm voxels). Two T1-weighted anatomical scans were also collected for spatial registration and normalization (3D and co-planar). Exploratory spectral analyses of Experiment 1 (not reported here) revealed that relatively high-frequency oscillations above 0.05 Hz contained meaningful signal, and thus temporal filtering was not used in Experiment 2. Our use of partial correlations eliminates concerns about high-frequency artifacts since it controls for shared variance across all frequencies. Otherwise, all preprocessing parameters and routines were identical to Experiment 1. \n\n#### Localizer analysis \n  \nOne localizer run containing 294 volumes was collected for each subject. Each localizer run consisted of an alternating block design in which 18-s stimulus blocks were interleaved with 18-s blocks of fixation. A total of 12 stimulus and fixation blocks were presented in each run, including six each for faces and scenes. Stimulus blocks consisted of 12 grayscale images from a single category, and subjects were required to detect back-to-back repetitions of an image. The localizer run was modeled and analyzed in the same way as Experiment 1, with one point worth emphasizing: the control category for every subject was scenes, and thus the PHC served as the sole control seed for the resting functional connectivity analyses described below. The FG and PHC seeds could be defined in every subject. \n\n\n#### Resting voxelwise analysis \n  \nAll subjects completed a single resting run containing 294 volumes in which they fixated a central point. Resting timeseries from the FG and PHC were extracted in the same manner as in Experiment 1, and whole-brain functional connectivity was assessed using an isomorphic, but slightly modified two-step multiple regression approach: we first fit data with all nuisance and control regressors and then performed whole-brain and ROI analyses on the residual from this GLM. This change permitted us to extract partial ROI timeseries that were orthogonal to the control region and nuisance variables, to mirror the variance fit in the whole-brain analysis. Due to the larger sample size, we used a higher voxel threshold (  z  \u2009=\u20092.3) at the first stage of cluster-correction. The corrected alpha after the second stage was identical (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). \n\n\n#### Resting ROI analysis \n  \nIn addition to the whole-brain analyses reported in Experiment 1, we also conducted an ROI analysis to further explore the relationship between the FG and the pSTS. Specifically, we compared the strength of the pSTS's correlation with the FG vs. the PHC. The previous analyses tested whether face-specific FG\u2013pSTS resting connectivity exists, and this analysis tests whether pSTS connectivity is widespread vs. more exclusive to the FG. \n\nFor this analysis, we localized the peak face-selective voxel in the FG and the pSTS and the peak scene-selective voxel in the PHC in each subject. While the FG and PHC were found in every subject (as described above), the pSTS could only be localized in 17/18 subjects and thus ROI analyses are reported for only those subjects. Timeseries were extracted from these regions using an 8-mm FWHM Gaussian-weighted average of voxels surrounding the peak, as was done for the whole-brain analysis. To account for the possibility that the selectivity of the resulting signals was weakened by this averaging, parallel analyses were conducted with just the peak voxel from each region. In both cases, a face-specific FG timeseries was produced for each subject by removing the raw PHC (and nuisance) resting timeseries from the raw FG resting timeseries using the regression model from the whole-brain analysis. Analogously, the raw FG (and nuisance) resting timeseries were removed from each subject's raw PHC resting timeseries, resulting in a scene-specific PHC timeseries. These partial timeseries were then separately correlated with the pSTS resting timeseries. A reliable correlation implies that the pSTS shares variance with the FG that is independent of the PHC (and vice versa). The FG\u2013pSTS and PHC\u2013pSTS correlation coefficients were converted to z scores using Fisher's   r  -to-  z   transformation. The reliability of the correlations was assessed across subjects using one-sample   t  -tests against a null hypothesis of 0, and the FG\u2013pSTS and PHC\u2013pSTS correlations were directly compared using a dependent-samples   t  -test. \n\n\n#### Resting/task pattern analysis \n  \nWhile the ROI analysis examined the strength of the pSTS correlation with the FG and PHC, it did not directly address whether FG or PHC correlations with pSTS are related to face processing. We therefore developed a novel pattern analysis approach to further characterize the face-specificity of pSTS connectivity. In particular, across voxels in the pSTS we tested how well the pattern of contrast values from the localizer (face\u2009> scene) predicted the pattern of partial correlations with the FG vs. the pattern of partial correlations with the PHC. We hypothesized that if FG\u2013pSTS connectivity is related to face processing, then pSTS voxels that are more selective for faces in the localizer should be more correlated with the FG at rest (a positive correlation between the localizer contrast and the amount of FG connectivity). Moreover, we hypothesized that if PHC\u2013pSTS connectivity is unrelated to face processing, then the face-selectivity of pSTS voxels in the localizer should not predict the strength of correlation with the PHC (a zero correlation). Note that this PHC analysis could also yield a negative correlation in which the scene-selectivity of pSTS voxels in the localizer (negative contrast values) would be correlated with greater PHC connectivity. \n\nThe two most intuitive ways to select pSTS voxels that will form the patterns for this analysis would be from the group resting FG connectivity map, or from the group face\u2009> scene localizer contrast. Note, however, that neither of these methods is independent of the analysis described above: the parameter estimates used to select the pSTS voxels of interest would also be used to compute the new correlation. Such non-independence could potentially bias the results in favor of our hypothesis. Given that there was a reliable PHC\u2013pSTS partial correlation in the ROI analysis, we were able to use a conservative approach: to form pSTS patterns, we selected a population of pSTS voxels that showed reliable partial correlations with the PHC. Selecting voxels in this way is conservative because the manner in which the voxels were selected is independent of the pattern of FG connectivity. If anything, this analysis could be biased in favor of finding an effect for the PHC rather than the FG because the PHC connectivity pattern was likely to have less noise. Note also that our relatively large voxel sizes and the application of spatial smoothing during preprocessing might reduce the amount of information carried in spatial voxel patterns. Critically, this works against us, and applies equally to the FG and PHC connectivity patterns. \n\nWhile we knew that the PHC correlated with the peak pSTS voxel, to obtain a bigger population of pSTS voxels we seeded the whole-brain with the partial PHC timeseries. We do not report additional results from this analysis because of the present focus on face processing; we are exploring the existence of a resting scene network in ongoing studies (see also Nir et al.,  ). We selected a cluster of voxels in the pSTS from the group resting connectivity map for the control PHC regressor (604 voxels,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). Because the pSTS voxels were selected at the group level, we apply this analysis to all 18 subjects (despite the lack of a face-specific pSTS ROI in one subject). We extracted three values from each pSTS voxel in every subject: the difference in parameter estimates for faces vs. scenes from the localizer (resulting in a localizer contrast map), the resting partial correlation with the FG (resulting in an FG connectivity map), and the resting partial correlation with the PHC (resulting in a PHC connectivity map). Only the single peak FG or PHC voxel was used to compute partial correlations with the pSTS because these seeds were being compared to single pSTS voxels, and because the previous analysis revealed that selectivity was partially diluted by the kernel. We compared the resulting pSTS voxel patterns by correlating: (1) the localizer contrast map with the FG connectivity map, (2) the localizer contrast map with the PHC connectivity map, and (3) the localizer contrast map with the difference map of FG\u2013PHC connectivity. The resulting correlation coefficients were converted to   z   scores, and compared across subjects with   t  -tests. \n\n\n\n### Results and discussion \n  \nIn an effort to replicate the finding of FG\u2013pSTS resting connectivity in Experiment 1, we conducted a second focused experiment with a new sample of subjects. We repeated the same whole-brain analysis, this time using a single control region (the scene-selective PHC). Again, we observed a right pSTS region that showed partial functional connectivity with the FG (Figure  A). The peak of this region was slightly anterior to the peak of Experiment 1, but importantly, it overlapped with the face-selective pSTS region from the independent localizer runs in Experiment 2 (Figure  B). Moreover, right FG was again reliably correlated with left FG (see Table   for additional regions and coordinates). These results further support the existence of a latent face-specific network including FG and pSTS. \n  \n Face-specific connectivity from Experiment 2  .   (A)   Group analysis of resting correlations with each subject's face-specific FG after removing variance from their scene-specific PHC.   (B)   The pSTS region that was correlated with the FG at rest overlapped with the face-selective pSTS region obtained in a group analysis of the localizer runs. \n    \n Resting partial FG connectivity in Experiment 2  . \n    \nTo quantify the spatial consistency of the pSTS obtained from resting and localizer analyses, we compared the location of the group resting connectivity pSTS to the locations of pSTS ROIs defined in each subject from the localizer (to be used in the ROI analysis below). Subtracting the resting connectivity peak from the mean location of the localizer ROIs resulted in differences of \u22123.90, \u22126.45, 7.41\u2009mm, along the   x  ,   y  , and   z   dimensions respectively. We further evaluated the distance of the resting connectivity peak from the 3-D cluster of pSTS ROIs. We first computed the Mahalanobis distance, taking into account the variance and covariance among spatial dimensions to produce a normalized squared distance from the cluster center (Mahalanobis distance =\u20092.98). In order to determine whether the resting connectivity peak was a multivariate outlier from the ROI cluster, we statistically evaluated this distance as Chi-squared with degrees of freedom equal to the number of dimensions (\u03c7 [3] =\u20092.98,   p   =\u20090.16). Based on the typical critical value for Mahalanobis distance outliers of   p   <\u20090.001 (Tabachnick and Fidell,  ), we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the resting connectivity pSTS peak is part of the same spatial distribution as the localizer ROI pSTS peaks. \n\nBy using a single well-characterized control region, we were also able to explore how the face-selective pSTS correlated with a region selective for a different visual category. To mirror the initial whole-brain analyses, we used a Gaussian kernel to generate the timeseries for the FG, PHC, and pSTS defined from the localizer. We observed a reliable FG\u2013pSTS correlation across subjects (mean   z   =\u20090.15,   t  [16] =\u20092.85,   p   =\u20090.011). Interestingly, the correlation between the PHC and pSTS also reached significance (mean   z   =\u20090.064,   t  [16] =\u20092.58,   p   =\u20090.020). The directional hypothesis that the FG shares more variance with the pSTS than the PHC approached significance (  t  [16] =\u20091.52, one-tailed   p   =\u20090.075). Since the spatial smoothing of the Gaussian kernels (blind to the underlying functional data) may have diluted the selectivity of the peak localizer voxels, we performed a parallel ROI analysis over just the peak voxels. The results for the two approaches agreed, although as hypothesized they were more robust at the peak: FG\u2013pSTS correlation (mean   z   =\u20090.18,   t  [16] =\u20092.95,   p   =\u20090.0094), PHC\u2013pSTS correlation (mean   z   =\u20090.063,   t  [16] =\u20092.21,   p   =\u20090.042); the paired comparison reached significance (  t  [16] =\u20091.77, one-tailed   p   =\u20090.048). These results are shown in Figure  . For the sake of completeness, we also verified that the whole-brain results held without using a kernel (Figure   in Appendix). \n  \n ROI analysis from Experiment 2  . Resting correlations between the FG (after partialing out the PHC) and the pSTS, and the PHC (after partialing out the FG) and the pSTS. Correlations were computed within-subject using peak voxels from the localizer and converted to   z  -scores for statistical tests. Error bars reflect standard errors of the mean. \n  \nThe FG\u2013pSTS connectivity replicated the whole-brain results using individual subjects\u2019 pSTS ROIs and without depending on spatial overlap across subjects; this suggests that our primary results are robust across analysis approaches. The PHC\u2013pSTS connectivity was somewhat unexpected, but note that the FG and PHC timeseries were orthogonalized with respect to each other, and therefore the correlations reflect independent sources of variance within the pSTS. Finally, while the whole-brain results support the novel conclusion that there exists variance in the FG that is unique with respect to the PHC and correlates with the pSTS, the ROI results not only support this conclusion, but provide preliminary support for the additional conclusion that there exists   more   variance in the (face-specific) pSTS related to the FG than to the PHC. Nevertheless, the paired comparison between the FG and PHC was weakly significant, and so we explored more incisive ways to test the face-selectivity of FG\u2013pSTS resting interactions. \n\nThe fact that the reliable FG\u2013pSTS and PHC\u2013pSTS correlations reflected statistically independent sources of variance suggests that they may represent functionally distinct relationships. In particular, we hypothesized that only FG\u2013pSTS connectivity would be related to face processing in the pSTS region. To test this prediction, we developed a novel pattern analysis to examine the relationship between localizer activation and resting connectivity within the pSTS. Using the localizer contrast (face >\u2009scene) as a measure of face-selectivity, we hypothesized that the pattern of localizer effects across pSTS voxels should be correlated with the pattern of correlations with the FG across pSTS voxels, but that the same should not be true for the pattern of correlations with the PHC across pSTS voxels. Indeed, across a population of pSTS voxels \u2013 selected using an independent and conservative approach (see section  ) \u2013 the strength of the localizer contrast (face >\u2009scene) in a given pSTS voxel was positively correlated with the strength of connectivity between that voxel and the peak FG (mean   z   =\u20090.15,   t  [17] =\u20093.98,   p   <\u20090.001). This relationship did not hold between a voxel's localizer effect and connectivity with the peak PHC (mean   z   =\u20090.0064,   t  [17] =\u20090.094,   p   =\u20090.93). The directional hypothesis that the localizer pattern should better predict the FG vs. PHC connectivity pattern reached significance (  t  [17] =\u20091.89, one-tailed   p   =\u20090.038), as did an analysis in which the localizer pattern (face \u2013 scene) was correlated with a connectivity difference pattern (FG\u2013PHC connectivity;   t  [17] =\u20092.15, one-tailed   p   =\u20090.023). These results are shown in Figure  . \n  \n Pattern analysis from Experiment 2  . Across a population of pSTS voxels, correlations between the strength of face-selectivity from the localizer and the strength of resting connectivity with the peak FG (after partialing out the PHC) and the peak PHC (after partialing out the FG). Voxels that were more face-selective in the localizer were also more correlated with the FG at rest, but there was no such relationship in either direction for the PHC. Moreover, face-selectivity in the localizer (face\u2013scene) predicted face-selectivity in partial resting connectivity (FG\u2013PHC connectivity). Correlations were computed within-subject and converted to   z  -scores for statistical tests. Error bars reflect standard errors of the mean. \n  \nNote that the direction of the localizer effect entered into these analyses (face >\u2009scene) only impacts the direction of the resulting correlation. Thus the null effect for the PHC suggests   no   relationship between either face- or scene-selectivity in the pSTS and connectivity with the PHC. These results provide strong evidence that FG\u2013pSTS resting correlations are related to face processing. \n\n\n\n## General Discussion \n  \n### Summary \n  \nThe goal of our study was to explore the existence of   face-specific   resting functional connectivity between the FG and pSTS. Across two experiments, we observed resting correlations between these two regions after controlling for many confounding factors such as the visual responsiveness of both regions and generic sources of whole-brain noise. Analogous to how category-specific visual processing is typically studied, we tested whether these correlations were face-specific by using another visual category as a control. In particular, we removed variance from the FG that was shared with a region specialized for the control category before computing the correlations with the pSTS. Additional ROI and pattern analyses further supported our interpretation of the FG\u2013pSTS correlations as face-specific. In the remainder of this section, we discuss issues related to this interpretation, and then consider our findings in the broader context of the face processing and resting state literatures. \n\n\n### Evidence for face-specificity \n  \nWe interpreted the observed FG\u2013pSTS resting connectivity as face-specific because it was obtained after removing the resting activity from a single category-specific control region, e.g., the scene-selective PHC. In principle, however, activity related to the processing of other categories \u2013 bodies, cars, word-strings, etc. \u2013 may have remained in the FG, thus affecting our claim that FG connectivity with the pSTS can be face-specific. We do not intend to claim that the observed FG\u2013pSTS resting connectivity was 100% face-specific as a result of using one control region. However, several features of our approach and results help establish this specificity. \n\nMost apparent to us is that this criticism could be leveled against almost every study involving category-specific ROIs: how can one be certain that a control condition contains all features of a stimulus   not specific   to the category of interest \u2013 why stop with bodies and cars, what about hair, animal faces, round objects, living things, etc.? One answer is that, in practice, scenes are an especially good control for face processing, and have been used extensively for this reason in functional localizers of the face-specific FG (e.g., Cox et al.,  ; Yi et al.,  ; Gazzaley et al.,  ; Turk-Browne et al.,  ). Moreover, in some ways our approach is more conservative than claiming face-specificity from a localizer contrast: despite showing greater responses to faces than scenes, the FG still shows some response above baseline to scenes (Johnson et al., 2007); orthogonalizing the response of the FG with respect to the PHC removes this variance. Finally, variance related to other categories could only influence our results if it was present in the FG and pSTS,   but not the PHC   \u2013 otherwise it would be removed by our partial correlation procedure. \n\nIn addition to these facts about the literature and our design, several results from our study support the conclusion that some component of FG\u2013pSTS resting connectivity is related to face processing. First, the correlated pSTS region in both experiments overlapped with the pSTS region that showed face-selective evoked responses in the independent localizer scans of the same subjects. Second, beyond demonstrating the there exists some FG\u2013pSTS partial correlation, the weaker PHC\u2013pSTS correlation in Experiment 2 suggests that the relationship with the FG is special. Third, despite qualitative differences in the measures obtained from the resting scans (correlations in spontaneous fluctuations from the FG) and the localizer scans (evoked responses to face vs. house images), the pattern of resting connectivity with the FG in the pSTS \u2013 but not with the PHC \u2013 was predictive of the pattern of face-selectivity from the localizer in the pSTS. These latter results provide especially compelling evidence that the resting FG\u2013pSTS relationship may have functional significance for face processing. \n\n\n### Face processing \n  \nFaces convey multiple types of information, including: identity, gaze direction, emotional expression, attractiveness, biological motion, and speech. Processing of these distinct features has been mapped onto different brain regions, which have in turn been organized hierarchically in distributed models of face processing (Haxby et al.,  ; Ishai,  ). While there has been disagreement over the degree of face-specificity and modularity of regions in the face network (Hanson et al.,  ; Wiggett and Downing,  ), perhaps the two most reliable nodes across studies are the FG (Puce et al.,  ; Kanwisher et al.,  ; McCarthy et al.,  ), involved in processing identity (Allison et al.,  ; Barton et al.,  ; Rotshtein et al.,  ), and the pSTS (Puce et al.,  ,  ; Kanwisher et al.,  ), involved in processing eye gaze and emotional expression (Puce et al.,  ; Narumoto et al.,  ; Pelphrey et al.,  ; Winston et al.,  ; Calder et al.,  ; Engell and Haxby,  ; Furl et al.,  ). \n\nBeyond specifying the functional properties of each individual node in a network, it may be essential to understand their connections in order to fully characterize face processing in the brain (Wiggett and Downing,  ; Thomas et al.,  ). One study demonstrated that connectivity between the FG and an extended network of brain regions during face processing is modulated by the nature of the face (Fairhall and Ishai,  ): in particular, the FG became more coupled with the amygdala during processing of emotional faces, and more coupled with orbitofrontal cortex during processing of famous faces. Our study \u2013 exploring connectivity between the FG and pSTS \u2013 helps inform an ongoing debate about the independence/interactivity of these regions (Allison et al.,  ; Duchaine et al.,  ; Andrews and Ewbank,  ; Calder and Young,  ; Fairhall and Ishai,  ; Vuilleumier and Pourtois,  ; Fox et al.,  ). Because both the FG and pSTS are responsive to visual face stimuli (Puce et al.,  ,  ; Kanwisher et al.,  ) and these stimulus-locked responses would be correlated, it is difficult to assess functional connectivity during face processing tasks. Our approach of examining functional connectivity at rest, without external face stimuli, is therefore well-suited to establishing the existence of intrinsic FG\u2013pSTS connectivity (see also Zhang et al.,  ). The robust and selective resting connectivity we observed between the FG and pSTS may help explain the sparseness of evidence for a double dissociation between identity and emotion processing in the brain (Calder and Young,  ). \n\n\n### Resting networks \n  \nThe brain can be divided into several networks of brain regions that exhibit correlations in spontaneous activity during rest (Fox and Raichle,  ). Networks have been identified for a variety of brain systems, including motor cortex (Biswal et al.,  ), visual cortex (Lowe et al.,  ), and auditory cortex (Cordes et al.,  ), and cognitive processes, including attention (Fox et al.,  ), executive control (Seeley et al.,  ), language (Hampson et al.,  ), and memory (Vincent et al.,  ), as well the \u201cdefault network\u201d of brain regions activated during rest (Greicius et al.,  ). Brain regions within a given network tend to have related functions, and are activated in unison by relevant tasks. In this context, small-scale category-specific networks may exist within a more global visual network. Our study suggests that   partial   functional connectivity analyses \u2013 where variances from other functional control seeds are removed \u2013 may prove especially useful for identifying these more specific networks. \n\nThis change may in part explain why we observed robust FG\u2013pSTS resting functional connectivity in contrast to Fairhall and Ishai ( ), who report weak effective connectivity between these two regions using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) during tasks. This apparent discrepancy may also result from several other features of their study: First, they did not obtain strong evidence at the group level that a feedforward model of face processing with no direct FG\u2013pSTS interaction provided a better fit than a model in which the FG causally influences the pSTS (supplemental non-parametric analyses were required to support this claim). Second, such model comparisons do not rule out existence of baseline FG\u2013pSTS interactions, but rather suggest that accounting for them leads to a worse overall model fit. Third, this study is susceptible to the limitations of DCM, including that the validity of conclusions from their study depends on the tasks and stimuli that they used (see Friston et al.,  ). For example, interactions between the FG and pSTS may have been more apparent if dynamic stimuli had been used, given the role of the pSTS in processing biological motion and its sensitivity to such stimuli (Pelphrey et al.,  ; Said et al.,  ). Fourth, their study addressed a different question \u2013 how connectivity   changes   across stimulus conditions (see also Rotshtein et al.,  ; Nummenmaa et al.,  ) \u2013 while we assessed the existence of stable intrinsic FG\u2013pSTS connectivity that persists at rest. Indeed, such intrinsic connectivity may be stationary across rest and task states, with task-related activity superimposed (Fox et al.,  ; Fox and Raichle,  ; Buckner et al.,  ). \n\nConsistent with this idea, significant FG\u2013pSTS resting connectivity was also observed in another recent study (Zhang et al.,  ). Their findings are consistent with ours and provide converging support for the existence of FG\u2013pSTS resting connectivity. However, there were some limitations of their approach for characterizing the specificity and functional significance of this relationship. For example, to assess the specificity of right FG connectivity they used a control region in contralateral left ventral temporal cortex, and thus connectivity with the FG may reflect hemisphere-specific variance in addition to face-specific variance (e.g., hemispheric differences in global vs. local processing; Fink et al.,  ). Perhaps most importantly, they relied exclusively on exploratory whole-brain contrasts. This approach makes it hard to assess whether the pSTS region exhibiting resting connectivity with the FG is related to the pSTS activated by face stimuli. In contrast, we reported several analyses that help link resting FG connectivity to task activation by face stimuli, including: (1) the spatial overlap between pSTS clusters from the voxelwise FG connectivity map and the localizer task, (2) resting connectivity between FG and pSTS ROIs defined from the localizer, and (3) correlations in the distributed patterns of face activation from the localizer and resting connectivity with the FG in the pSTS. These analyses provide novel evidence of face-specific resting connectivity between the FG and pSTS. \n\nWhile there have been previous attempts to link resting functional connectivity with task-related processing, these efforts have focused primarily on the impact of recent tasks on resting connectivity (Peltier et al.,  ; Waites et al.,  ; Stevens et al.,  ), or on the ability of resting connectivity to predict behavior (Hampson et al.,  ; Fox et al.,  ; cf. Turk-Browne et al.,  ; Leber et al.,  ). The pattern analysis technique introduced in Experiment 2 may provide a new method for assessing the functional significance of intrinsic interactions. This approach could be applied broadly to help constrain relationships between nodes in established networks (e.g., the frontoparietal attention network), and also help to discover networks in the first place. For example, after finding a region activated by a task, one could search for seeds that produce a pattern of resting connectivity in that region predictive of the pattern of task activation. Interactions with such seeds may be important for the function of the initial region. \n\n\n### Future directions \n  \nFurther work will be needed to fully characterize the nature of the relationship between the FG and pSTS. Resting functional connectivity between the FG and pSTS may signify that these two regions are directly interactive. Alternatively, interactions between the FG and pSTS may be mediated by other regions, such as the inferior occipital gyrus or lateral occipital complex. Causal interpretations such as these are inherently underdetermined by correlations in the BOLD response. However, a recent study using combined microstimulation and fMRI demonstrated that electrical stimulation of a face-selective patch in primate inferior temporal cortex resulted in selective BOLD responses in other non-contiguous face patches in the temporal lobe (Moeller et al.,  ). While the precise homologies between these patches and human FG/pSTS are unknown, this study nevertheless supports the existence of direct connections between face regions in the temporal lobe. Such connections may be essential for face recognition: individuals with congenital prosopagnosia have disrupted structural connectivity in white matter tracts that run adjacent to the FG into typically face-selective regions of the anterior temporal and frontal lobes (Thomas et al.,  ), accompanied by reduced functional connectivity between the FG and those regions (M. Behrmann, personal communication). \n\nIn addition, it is unclear how face perception modulates functional connectivity between the FG and pSTS. If, for example, FG\u2013pSTS interactions help integrate facial identity and expression information, connectivity may change when new individuals or expressions appear in the environment. Such hypotheses may prove difficult to test with resting data, and thus ongoing studies are exploring the dynamics of FG\u2013pSTS functional connectivity during face processing. Finally, while we observed reliable resting connectivity between the FG and pSTS, these regions may differ in terms of stability of their connectivity with other regions. For example, because of its strong selectivity for faces, the FG may exhibit stable connectivity with the same set of face processing regions during both rest and tasks (Zhang et al.,  ), even though the relative strength of these connections may be influenced by stimulus features (Fairhall and Ishai,  ). In contrast, because the pSTS has been associated with several distinct cognitive processes in addition to face perception \u2013 such as biological motion, theory of mind, and multisensory integration \u2013 its connectivity with other brain regions may be less stable and depend largely on task demands (Hein and Knight,  ). Future studies could use our approach to identify the components of pSTS connectivity. For example, if resting data were collected along with tasks associated with the full range of pSTS functions, connectivity associated with one function (e.g., theory of mind) could be characterized by partialing out the variance from control regions activated by the other functions (e.g., FG for face processing, MT for biological motion, and auditory cortex for multisensory integration). Nevertheless, our initial evidence suggests that the FG may have a special relationship with the pSTS, at least with respect to other category-specific regions of ventral visual cortex. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nCognitive neuroscience has recently undergone a revolution with the discovery that the brain can be parcellated into coherent and dynamic functional networks. Similar to our increasingly precise understanding of the functions of individual brain regions, the current results provide initial evidence that the division of the brain into gross sensory, motor, and default networks may underestimate the number and specificity of resting networks. Accordingly, even specific types of information processing \u2013 such as face processing \u2013 may be reflected in fMRI not only as activation changes in single brain regions, but also in the degree to which these changes are synchronous across regions. \n\n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: T1\n### Label: Table 1\nRegion\tUnnamed: 1\tx\ty\tz\nPOSITIVE CORRELATIONS\t\t\t\t\nPosterior superior temporal sulcus\tR\t50\t\u221258\t14\nFusiform gyrus\tL\t\u221238\t\u221250\t\u221220\nInferior occipital gyrus\tR\t44\t\u221274\t\u221216\n\tL\t\u221242\t\u221274\t\u221218\nLateral occipital cortex\tR\t46\t\u221276\t0\n\t\t42\t\u221276\t12\n\tL\t\u221240\t\u221282\t0\n\t\t\u221238\t\u221268\t12\nHippocampus\tR\t20\t\u221228\t-6\n\tL\t\u221220\t\u221218\t\u221216\n\t\t\u221218\t\u221234\t\u22126\nAmygdala\tL\t\u221226\t\u22124\t\u221224\nAnterior cingulate\t\t0\t\u22124\t28\nPutamen\tR\t32\t0\t\u22124\nCaudate body\tL\t\u221214\t0\t20\nCaudate head/nucleus\tL\t\u22128\t10\t2\nThalamus\tL\t\u22124\t\u221214\t4\nPons\t\t\u22124\t\u221224\t\u221230\nBrainstem\t\t2\t\u221220\t\u221210\nCerebellum\tL\t\u221216\t\u221272\t\u221230\nNEGATIVE CORRELATIONS\t\t\t\t\nFrontal pole\tR\t28\t56\t\u221212\n\tL\t\u221228\t62\t2\n### Caption\nResting partial FG connectivity in Experiment 1.\n### Footer\nPeak MNI coordinates from clusters correlated with the FG regressor after removing variance from the control regressor (corrected p <\u20090.05).\n\n\n## ID: T2\n### Label: Table 2\nRegion\tUnnamed: 1\tx\ty\tz\nPOSITIVE CORRELATIONS\t\t\t\t\nPosterior superior temporal sulcus\tR\t54\t\u221244\t10\nFusiform gyrus\tL\t\u221230\t\u221252\t\u221222\nInferior occipital gyrus\tR\t36\t\u221276\t\u221214\nMiddle superior temporal sulcus\tR\t48\t\u221220\t\u221210\nLateral occipital cortex\tR\t50\t\u221268\t\u22126\n\tL\t\u221238\t\u221278\t\u22124\nMedial temporal lobe\tR\t36\t\u22126\t\u221230\nTransverse occipital sulcus\tR\t30\t\u221272\t20\n\tL\t\u221220\t\u221280\t22\nSuperior parietal lobule\tR\t28\t\u221248\t54\n\tL\t\u221228\t\u221248\t52\nPrecentral gyrus\tR\t54\t4\t34\nNEGATIVE CORRELATIONS\t\t\t\t\nMedial frontal gyrus\tR\t4\t32\t36\nAngular gyrus\tR\t64\t\u221246\t40\n\tL\t\u221258\t\u221248\t42\nOrbital frontal cortex\tR\t42\t26\t\u221210\n\tL\t\u221246\t34\t\u22128\nInferior frontal gyrus\tR\t48\t18\t6\nMiddle frontal gyrus\tR\t48\t22\t44\nSuperior frontal gyrus\tR\t22\t16\t60\n\tL\t\u221224\t14\t60\nAnterior insula\tR\t36\t20\t\u22124\n\tL\t\u221232\t16\t\u22128\n### Caption\nResting partial FG connectivity in Experiment 2.\n### Footer\nPeak MNI coordinates from clusters correlated with the FG regressor after removing variance from the control regressor (corrected p <\u20090.05).\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 2995581, "text_md5": "c137659b0253cb46264c6bae656b4756", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 77], "journal": [78, 96], "publication_year": [98, 102], "title": [113, 224], "keywords": [238, 367], "abstract": [380, 2077], "body": [2086, 58507], "tables": [58520, 60301]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 21151362, "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2010.00176", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995581", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=2995581"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995581\">2995581</a>", "list_title": "PMC2995581  Face-Specific Resting Functional Connectivity between the Fusiform Gyrus and Posterior Superior Temporal Sulcus"}

Before and after the intervention program, the body mass index (BMI) (kg/m ) was 38.15 \u00b1 4.7 vs. 34.18 \u00b1 4.5 (  p   < 0.02), and body weight (kg) was 98.5 \u00b1 13.1 vs. 88.28 \u00b1 12.2 (  p   < 0.03). All subjects underwent a pre- and post-intervention fMRI under fasting conditions. Functional connectivity was assessed using seed-based correlations. After the intervention, we found decreased connectivity between the left inferior parietal cortex and the right temporal cortex (  p   < 0.001), left posterior cingulate (  p   < 0.001), and right posterior cingulate (  p   < 0.03); decreased connectivity between the left superior frontal gyrus and the right temporal cortex (  p   < 0.01); decreased connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and the somatosensory cortex (  p   < 0.025); and decreased connectivity between the left and right posterior cingulate (  p   < 0.04). Results were considered significant at a voxel-wise threshold of   p   \u2264 0.05, and a cluster-level family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons of   p   \u2264 0.05. In conclusion, functional connectivity between brain structures involved in the pathophysiology of obesity (the inferior parietal lobe, posterior cingulate, temporo-insular cortex, prefrontal cortex) may be modified by a weight loss program including a Mediterranean diet and physical exercise. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nStudies of the pathophysiology of obesity using advanced neuroimaging techniques such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI) (at rest or using tasks), and positron emission tomography have found altered brain systems related to reward, motor, cognition, control, and attention [ , ]. Other studies have demonstrated that a Mediterranean diet has cognitive benefits [ ], suggesting that it may have a potential role in preventing overweight/obesity [ , ], though most of these were clinical studies with no neuroimaging analysis. Neuroimaging markers are sensitive measurements of structural and functional changes in the aging brain. We can use these markers to examine associations between diet- and age-related brain changes that might not be detectable using clinical assessment. A few studies have examined the relationship between a Mediterranean diet and structural neuroimaging markers of gray matter volume such as brain atrophy and cortical thickness [ , , , , , , ]. Luciano et al. found that lower adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with total brain atrophy over a three-year interval [ ], and Gu et al. demonstrated that Mediterranean diet adherence was associated with less brain atrophy, with larger brain volumes of the cingulate cortex, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and hippocampus, and larger cortical thickness of the superior-frontal region [ ]. Other studies found similar results, showing evidence that the Mediterranean diet predominantly protects the brain structure in certain cognitively-vulnerable regions (e.g., the frontotemporal lobes) [ , ]. In addition, the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and white matter structures has also been explored. Pelletier et al. found that Mediterranean diet adherence was associated with a general pattern of preserved white matter microstructure in multiple regions [ ]. Other studies have also shown the benefits of diet and physical activity on brain structure in successful dieters. Honea et al. found that weight loss percentage correlated positively with baseline gray matter volume in the right parahippocampal and orbitofrontal gyri in obese dieters, concluding that weight loss is related to volumetric changes in brain areas linked to interoception and food motivation [ ]. On the other hand, some studies have examined obesity and cerebral connectivity through functional magnetic resonance with a resting state modality, but very few included a dietary intervention and/or physical exercise. Furthermore, the impact of a Mediterranean diet on cerebral connectivity in obese patients when losing weight has not been previously explored. Thus, this study includes resting state and an intervention with a Mediterranean diet. Brain functional connectivity studies in the resting state in obesity are emerging, and have focused attention on brain networks such as the default mode network (DMN), the salience network (SN), and the somatosensory network (SMN) [ , , , , ] as being networks susceptible to alteration. \n\nThe DMN is a functionally-connected network of brain regions that includes the posterior cingulate cortex, cuneus/precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, and inferior parietal cortices [ ]. Connectivity in the DMN is thought to reflect a baseline state of brain function, in which subjects are not focused on the external environment but rather on their internal mental state, which may include various forms of spontaneous cognition, self-reflective thought, or attention to internal stimuli [ ]. Previous resting-state studies have demonstrated potential differences in the DMN function between obese and lean subjects, with an increased DMN connectivity in obese individuals [ ]. In addition, exercise has been found to normalize DMN function in overweight/obese individuals [ ]. \n\nThe SN comprises paralimbic structures such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the orbital and insular cortices [ ], and is involved in emotional arousal, reward sensitivity, and decision-making [ ]. Functional connectivity in this network has also been found to be altered in obesity [ ]. Under resting-state screening, functional connectivity changes in the SN have been reported in obese as compared with lean individuals [ , ]. Increased connectivity in SN structures such as the nucleus accumbens and anterior cingulate has also been reported in obese women [ ]. Another study showed increased functional connectivity within the putamen nucleus in the SN in obese subjects [ ]. Finally, in response to visual food cues, chronic exercise has been associated with significantly reduced activation in the insula [ ]. \n\nThe SMN\u2014including the supplementary motor area, sensorimotor cortex, and secondary somatosensory cortex [ ]\u2014has also been found to be altered in obesity [ , ]. In addition, associations have been found between these three networks (DMN, SN, and SMN) and fat mass and the obesity-associated gene Obesity Risk Allele during the resting-state [ ]. \n\nThe aim of this study was to examine the connectivity between structures included in the DMN, SN, and SMN before and six months after a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet and physical activity program in a group of obese women. Previous cross-sectional studies comparing obese with lean subjects have generally reported increased connectivity after studying these networks directly. Furthermore, in the present study we explored different structures included in these networks using seed-based analysis and examined the possible changes in connectivity between them before and after a weight loss program. We hypothesized that these obesity-related alterations in functional connectivity would be modified after the program, with obese subjects displaying decreased connectivity. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nThe study involved 19 obese women (defined by a body mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) \u226530 kg/m ) who agreed to participate in a program comprising a hypocaloric weight-loss Mediterranean diet and physical activity. Participants were included in the study on their first visit if they met the following inclusion criteria: having no metabolic disorder related to obesity, women between the ages of 35 and 55, had not tried to lose weight within one year of our intervention, and whose lifestyle was sedentary. Exclusion criteria included a history of any neurological disorder, an estimated intelligence quotient <85 points (assessed with the vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 3rd edition (WAIS-III)), or the presence of any psychiatric disorder (including eating disorders, anxiety or depression assessed with the Hamilton anxiety and depression scale, abuse of smoking, alcohol, or other drugs abuse), use of medication that could affect brain function (e.g., antidepressants), a history of any metabolic disorder possibly related to obesity, and general contraindications for MRI. Participants were recruited from the Endocrinology Department at the Regional University Hospital of Malaga, and the MRIs were performed at the Centro de Investigaciones M\u00e9dico Sanitarias (CIMES), University of Malaga. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the revised Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Regional University Hospital of Malaga (approval code API5-10/13) on 29 October 2013, and all subjects provided written and signed informed consent before participation. \n\n\n### 2.2. Intervention \n  \nThe diet consisted of a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet [ , ] based on the use of olive oil as the main source of visible fat and a regular consumption of vegetables (\u22652 servings/day), fruits (\u22653 servings/day), legumes (\u22653 servings/week), and fish (\u22653 times per week), reducing the consumption of red meat (\u22642 times per week), and eliminating (or reducing to \u22641 time/week) the consumption of dairy milk, sugary drinks, and sweets and chocolates. This hypocaloric Mediterranean diet restricted energy intake to about 600 kcal (or approximately 30% of the estimated energy requirement); 35\u201340% of the total daily calorie intake was from fat (8\u201310% saturated fatty acids), 40\u201345% carbohydrates (low glycemic index), and 20% protein based on the general patterns of the Mediterranean diet, calculating a calorie deficit following the Harris\u2013Benedict equation, with the aim of achieving a body weight loss of \u22655%. \n\nParticipants were given healthy lifestyle guidelines by a nutritionist and were provided with a physical activity monitor. Regarding nutrition, participants made individual personalized visits with the nutritionist 30\u201360 min per week during the intervention, in which their body weight was measured and the response to weight loss was seen. In addition, they were given a validated semi-quantitative 137-item food frequency questionnaire [ , ] as well as a validated 14-item questionnaire [ ] to measure the adherence to the Mediterranean diet both at the beginning and six months after starting the intervention. High adherence was considered to be 12\u201314 points, moderate adherence 8\u201311 points, low adherence 5\u20137 points, and very low adherence 5 points. Furthermore, nutritional group meetings were held monthly to increase the motivation of all participants. Concerning the physical activity program, a daily exercise practice was recommended. The minimum aim was walking an average of 150 min per week. This minimum level of defined activity was based on the cardiometabolic benefit demonstrated in other studies [ ]. \n\nParticipants were assessed and encouraged to gradually increase their level of physical activity to reach at least 45 min per day at the end of the six-month intervention period. In addition, participants were given a pedometer for their own use to encourage motivation. Once a month during the intervention, they went to the sports center with the physical activity monitor who checked whether the participants performed the physical activity. \n\nBefore, during, and after the whole program, weekly anthropometric measurements (weight, body mass index, and waist circumference) were taken with a Tanita BC-420MA (Tanita Corp., Tokyo, Japan), and height was measured by a stadiometer with the participants wearing no shoes. Blood analysis measurements, including glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), were also recorded at baseline and after the program. \n\n\n### 2.3. Study Design \n  \nAll participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans under resting state conditions before and six months after following the Mediterranean diet and physical activity program. All the post-intervention fMRI scans were performed within 24\u201372 h after completing the intervention. They were asked to refrain from eating or drinking (except water) for five hours before the scan. All the MRI scans were performed at the same time in the afternoon. Functional connectivity of the regions of interest was assessed using a seed-based correlation approach. Three participants were not included in the analysis because they did not perform the second MRI (one did not complete the intervention and two did not want to be scanned again, although they completed the intervention). The rest of the participants (  n   = 16 women) responded to treatment and none gained weight. \n\n\n### 2.4. Image Acquisition \n  \nThe MRI scans were performed on a 3-T MRI scanner (Philips,Amsterdam,Netherlands, Medical Systems Netherlands, 3T Intera, Release 2.6, with an eight-channel platform) with a MASTER gradient system (nominal maximum gradient strength = 30 mT/m, maximum slew rate = 150 mT/m/ms), equipped with a six-channel Philips SENSE head coil. Head movements were minimized using head pads and a forehead strap. High-resolution T1 structural images of the whole brain were acquired using a matrix acquisition 312/320 r, field of view of 250 mm, Repetition Time (TR) = 9.9 ms, Echo Time (TE) = 4.5 ms, flip angle = 8\u00b0, Turbo field echo (TFE) factor = 179. Slice thickness was 0.8 mm and there was no gap between slices; voxels were isotropic: 0.8 mm \u00d7 0.8 mm \u00d7 0.8 mm. \n\nResting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) images were also acquired, with a Fast Field Echo (FFE)/ Echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with a 220 mm field of view (FOV), TR = 2000 ms, TE= 35 ms, flip angle 82\u00b0, an acquisition matrix of 80/128 r, and an acquisition voxel size of 2.75 mm \u00d7 2.75 mm \u00d7 4.00 mm. Three hundred volumes were obtained with 32 slices each, with no gap between the slices. The length of time of the resting state acquisition was 10:00 min. Both structural and rs-fMRI studies were acquired before and after the intervention. \n\n\n### 2.5. Image Processing \n  \nImage preprocessing was performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, England;  ) running on MATLAB 8.2.0.701 (R2013b). Each subject\u2019s functional images were realigned to the mean position of all scans, and it was checked that the participants\u2019 movements during acquisition did not exceed 1.7 mm translation or 2.3\u00b0 rotation. High-resolution structural T1 images were anterior and posterior commissures (AC-PC) oriented, and then the functional scans were co-registered to the respective T1 images. These were used for normalization to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Smoothing of the functional scans was carried out with an 8-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) kernel. The structural scans were also segmented in order to obtain grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) maps. \n\nThe conn toolbox (version 1.4, McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA,  ) was used for the seed-based connectivity analysis. A band-pass filter with cut-off frequencies of 0.008 and 0.09 Hz was applied to exclude drifts and high-frequency activations. In addition to movement parameters, white matter and CSF blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time-series were also introduced as confounders in the denoising stage in order to exclude non-neural fluctuations from the analysis. \n\nThe areas selected as seeds were structures included in the well-established neural networks (DMN, SN, and SSN) including: left and right inferior parietal lobes, right and left superior temporal gyrus, left and right insula, right and left superior frontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, right and left posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus, and right and left olfactory regions. Bilateral olfactory and posterior cingulum regions were taken from the IBASPM116 atlas included in the Wake Forest University Pickatlas toolbox [ ]. The other areas were taken from the resting state reliability (rsREL) regions of interest (ROIs) provided with the conn toolbox. They are defined as 9-mm radius spheres, centered on the coordinates (seed definitions). \n\nFollowing the usual pipeline for seed-based correlation analyses, a first-level individual analysis was initially carried out, followed by a second-level group analysis. Firstly, an ROI-to-ROI approach was used: the BOLD signal timeline at each seed region was checked for correlations with the BOLD signal timeline at each of the other preselected regions. Afterwards, a seed-to-voxel analysis was also carried out: the correlation between the BOLD timeline at the seed region and the BOLD timeline at each voxel of the image was calculated. As mentioned, these correlations were initially studied on an individual level, and then the second level of analysis was applied. Here, the parametric (  z  -score) values obtained for each individual were compared, both at the ROI-to-ROI and at the seed-to-voxel levels. In particular, a paired   t  -test allowed assessment of changes in BOLD signal correlation associated to the program for each seed. \n\nFor ROI-to-ROI analyses, two-sided family-wise error (FWE) correction was applied at the analysis level, with a significance threshold of   p   = 0.05. Seed-to-voxel comparisons were FWE-corrected and false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected at the cluster level, with the same threshold as before (  p   = 0.05). \n\n\n### 2.6. Statistical Analysis \n  \nAll the clinical and blood test parameters are summarized as descriptive statistics in  . The results are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. For inter-group comparisons before and after the intensive weight loss program, paired-sample   t  -tests were used for continuous variables, and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for such variables when the assumptions for the   t  -test were violated. The \u03b1-level was set at   p   < 0.05 for these two-tailed statistical comparisons using SPSS statistical software, version 21.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics \n  \nThe participants were 16 obese women aged 46.31 \u00b1 4.07 years. Before and after the Mediterranean diet and physical activity program, the BMI (kg/m ) was 38.15 \u00b1 4.7 vs. 34.18 \u00b1 4.5 (  p   < 0.02), and the weight (kg) was 98.5 \u00b1 13.1 vs. 88.28 \u00b1 12.2 (  p   < 0.03). The score for adherence to the Mediterranean diet rose from 7.2 \u00b1 2.3 points at baseline to 10.7 \u00b1 2.0 points after the program. All the clinical, anthropometric, and blood analysis characteristics at baseline and after the weight loss program are summarized in  , and changes in energy and nutrient intakes according to weight loss baseline and after the intervention are summarized in  . \n\n\n### 3.2. Neuroimaging Connectivity \n  \n#### 3.2.1. Functional Connectivity of the Left Inferior Parietal Lobe \n  \nIn the ROI-to-ROI analysis, the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) showed lower connectivity with the precuneus and the right inferior parietal lobe after the Mediterranean diet and weight loss program than before (two-sided FWE-correction at the analysis level,   p   < 0.05). In the seed-to-voxel examination, the IPL showed decreased functional connectivity with three clusters after the program. The first cluster included the right angular gyrus (AG), the right superior temporal gyrus (STG), the right supramarginal gyrus (SmG), and the insular cortex (IC) (  p   < 0.001); the second cluster included the right dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dpCC) and the left and right somatosensory association cortices (SsAC) (  p   < 0.001); and the third cluster included the left dpCC, the left SsAC, the left retrosplenial cingulate cortex (RsCC), and the left cingulate cortex (CC) (  p   < 0.03). Data were thresholded at a cluster-extent threshold of   p   \u2264 0.05, both with few corrections and for FDR correction ( ). The results are summarized in  . \n\n\n#### 3.2.2. Functional Connectivity of the Left Superior Frontal Gyrus \n  \nThe seed-to-voxel analysis showed that after the intervention the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) region had lower functional connectivity with the right SmG, right STG, right IC, and right AG (  p   \u2264 0.05, FWE-corrected) ( ). The results are summarized in  . \n\n\n#### 3.2.3. Functional Connectivity of the Right Posterior Superior Temporal Gyrus \n  \nThe results of seed-to-voxel analysis showed that after the intervention the right posterior STG region had lower functional connectivity with the left premotor cortex (PmC), left primary motor cortex (PMC), and the left primary somatosensory cortex (PSsC) (  p   < 0.02, FWE-corrected) ( ). The results are summarized in  . \n\n\n#### 3.2.4. Functional Connectivity of the Right Posterior Cingulate Cortex \n  \nIn the ROI-to-ROI analysis, the right posterior CC region showed decreased connectivity with the left posterior CC after the program. \n\nThe seed-to-voxel analysis also showed that the right posterior CC had lower functional connectivity with the left dpCC and left ventral posterior cingulate cortex (vpCC) (  p   < 0.04, FWE-corrected) ( ). The results are summarized in  . \n\nWe found no statistically significant differences when using the following seed regions: right inferior parietal lobe, right superior frontal cortex, left superior temporal gyrus, left insula, anterior cingulate gyrus, and right and left olfactory regions. \n\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThe present study was performed to examine the cerebral functional connectivity in obese women screened before and six months following a program involving a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet and increased physical activity. Previous studies have studied the effect of a Mediterranean diet on cognition and brain structure [ , ]. However, the impact of this intervention program (Mediterranean diet and physical activity) on cerebral connectivity in obese women after weight loss has not been previously studied. After the intervention, the anthropometric variables (BMI and weight) were reduced significantly in all patients, and the blood analysis profile (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, insulin resistance index, insulin, and glucose) improved greatly. \n\nThe main finding of this study was the identification of decreased connectivity within the inferior parietal cortices, the posterior cingulate, and the prefrontal cortex after the Mediterranean diet and physical activity program (structures included in the DMN). In addition, there was also decreased connectivity within the temporo-insular cortex (included in the SN), as well as decreased connectivity in the somatosensory cortex (included in the SMN) after the intervention program. \n\nPrevious studies using functional connectivity analysis of the so-called \u201cdefault mode network\u201d\u2014a network comprising the lateral parietal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus [ , ]\u2014have demonstrated increased DMN connectivity in overweight/obese individuals, indicating an increased focus on internal states such as appetite or food-related cognitive factors [ , ]. A previous study performed in a eucaloric state found greater connectivity in obese compared to lean individuals in the lateral inferior parietal and posterior cingulate cortices. In addition, the authors found that the lateral parietal connectivity correlated positively with appetite [ ]. Thus, greater connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex has been postulated to contribute to overeating, reflecting an imbalance between cognitive and emotional processing of food cues [ ]. In line with previous studies, our results showed decreased connectivity in the left inferior parietal cortex with the posterior cingulate cortices after the intervention program, showing that the connectivity between these structures was modified after the program. As mentioned before, the lateral inferior parietal and posterior cingulates are nodes of the DMN and are involved in coordinating the subsystems of self-referential thought and internal state, such as appetite or other processing of gut signals or food-related cognitive factors [ , ]. Given this fact, it is possible to speculate on the functional significance of over-connectivity of these regions in obese individuals during fasting state [ ] and, interestingly, according to our results, this over-connectivity can be rectified by weight loss and physical activity. \n\nOn the other hand, we also found decreased connectivity between the lateral inferior parietal cortex and the temporal cortex, including the insula. The insula is part of the so-called \u201csalience network\u201d which is involved in consciousness and self-perception and connects the perception of internal stimuli to aspects of emotion and motivation [ ]. The SN, including the anterior cingulate, limbic structures, and temporal cortex, has been related to obesity in that it perceives internal and external cues to appropriately adapt behavior and/or physiology accordingly [ , ]. Thus, the insular cortex plays an established role in cognitive and emotional control and has been suggested to induce the termination of feeding and the ability to predict the satisfactory effects of food intake [ , ]. Increased SN functional connectivity in overweight/obese individuals has also been previously reported [ , ] under resting state conditions. In line with our results, decreased connectivity between the lateral inferior parietal cortex and the temporo-insular cortex after the weight loss program suggest that this decreased connectivity probably plays an inhibiting role in emotional functions susceptible to modification by a weight loss program. \n\nWe also found decreased connectivity after the Mediterranean diet and physical intervention program between the prefrontal cortex and the insular/angular gyrus/superior temporal gyrus/supramarginal gyrus. The prefrontal cortex is involved in the central orexigenic network [ ], and its connections with the insula reflect an ability to \u201cevaluate\u201d the perception of hunger during fasting state in lean subjects. A \u201csatiation\u201d of this signal is understood to occur after food intake, whereas in obesity there seems to exist a level of insensitivity to these food-related cues [ , ]. According to our results, changes in the connections between the prefrontal and insular cortices are probably implicated in feeding initiative and decrease during weight loss, showing that these regions are also susceptible to modification. \n\nFurthermore, we found decreased connectivity in the temporal cortex with the left premotor, primary motor, and somatosensory cortices after the Mediterranean diet and physical activity intervention program. The SMN\u2014including the supplementary motor area, sensorimotor cortex, and secondary somatosensory cortex [ ]\u2014corresponds to the action\u2013execution programs and perception\u2013somesthesis integration [ ]. Previous studies have reported evidence for differences in somatosensory processing in obese subjects [ ]. Conversely, a recent study in women with anorexia nervosa found decreased connectivity in the SMN when compared with controls, suggesting that it could be related to altered interoception and body image in these women when they are underweight [ ]. Our results suggest that changes in sensory-motor structures would be modified after a weight loss program, as these structures play an important role in self-perception and the somesthesis mechanism. \n\nFinally, we found decreased connectivity after the intervention between the right posterior cingulate cortex and the left posterior cingulate cortex, which suggests the integration between both hemispheres [ ]. \n\nA few studies have examined the effects of different interventions on functional connectivity in individuals with obesity. McFadden et al. found a six-month exercise intervention to be associated with reduced DMN connectivity in the precuneus during rest. Interestingly, the authors concluded that, given previous reports of DMN overconnectivity in overweight/obese individuals, the findings may indicate an exercise-related \u201cnormalization\u201d of network function [ ]. Recently, Legget et al. found changes in connectivity after a six-month exercise program in the posterior cingulate cortex and other networks (language, visual, sensorimotor, executive, basal ganglia, and posterior DMN), which were significantly reduced [ ]. Other authors have found evidence of changes in functional connectivity depending on intervention type (diet vs. bariatric surgery) after weight loss [ ]. \n\nThe effects of weight loss on the brain are still unknown. It is difficult to speculate which biological changes are associated with the differences observed during our study in functional brain connectivity after the Mediterranean diet and physical activity program. Exercise has been suggested to promote neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and neuroplasticity [ , , , ]. Exercise may affect metabolic factors and neuronal circuitry and exert positive effects on neuronal networks by reducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines, increasing the production of neurotrophic factors, or increasing neurotransmitter levels [ , , , ]. In addition, weight loss also influences adipocytokines, inducing lower levels of leptin and higher levels of adiponectin. Adiponectin\u2014levels of which are inversely correlated with adiposity\u2014improves insulin sensitivity in major insulin target tissues, modulates inflammatory responses, and plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy metabolism. Previous studies have suggested neuroprotective effects of adiponectin in the hippocampal cells in the temporal lobe [ , ]. The burden of the insula and the precuneus has also been associated with low levels of adiponectin [ ], and both these areas are important structures of the main brain networks (DMN and SN). \n\nThe present study is the first to study resting-state functional connectivity in obesity while including both a Mediterranean diet and physical activity intervention. Several limitations of the current study need to be addressed. First, the sample size is small, which is a potential limitation. Another important limitation is that there was no control group to safely attribute changes, though the results and the longitudinal design are strengths. In addition, it is not possible to know whether the changes are due to physical exercise, the Mediterranean diet reducing caloric intake, or both. In general, patients carrying out a weight loss program at the Department of Endocrinology are advised to follow a diet (reducing caloric intake) as well as engaging in physical exercise. Further longitudinal studies including only physical exercise [ ] would be desirable to determine which is responsible for the connectivity changes\u2014the Mediterranean diet, the physical activity, or both. Moreover, only female subjects were included. We decided to include only female subjects to avoid a sex bias. As a consequence, our results can only be generalized to women. Finally, other technical limitations (e.g., using a six-channel head coil rather than the more standard 12-channel head coil which would have reduced the noise ratio) could influence the findings. Furthermore, all the functional MRIs (pre- and post-intervention) were carried out under fasting conditions, and it would be interesting to evaluate brain connectivity in a state of satiety; it is probable that the brain networks found would differ since previous evidence shows that the pathophysiology is different [ , ]. Despite the aforementioned limitations, we still consider our results to be clinically pertinent, as they support the benefits of the Mediterranean diet and may provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity. However, more longitudinal studies on larger samples, with an appropriate design including a control group, are needed to shed light on the effects of obesity on the brain and to aid in developing future treatments that could act on the neural networks involved in this disease. \n\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that functional connectivity between specific brain structures involved in obesity physiopathology (the inferior parietal lobe, posterior cingulate, temporo-insular cortex, and prefrontal cortex) might be modified by a weight loss program including a Mediterranean diet and physical exercise. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: nutrients-09-00685-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tBefore the Mediterranean Diet/Physical Activity Program\tAfter the Mediterranean Diet/Physical Activity Program\nN (women)\t16\t16\nAge (years)\t46.3 \u00b1 4.07\t46.3 \u00b1 4.07\nWeight (kg)\t98.5 \u00b1 13.1\t88.2 \u00b112.2 *\nBody mass index (kg/m2)\t38.1 \u00b1 4.7\t34.1 \u00b1 4.5 *\nWaist circumference(cm)\t115.3 \u00b1 11.8\t110.5 \u00b1 10.9\nGlucose (mg/dL)\t92.9 \u00b1 12.5\t82.5 \u00b1 12.9 *\nHbA1c (%)\t5.5 \u00b1 0.4\t5.4 \u00b1 0.3\nCreatinine (mg/dL)\t0.6 \u00b1 0.1\t0.6 \u00b1 0.1\nUric acid (mg/dL)\t13.6 \u00b1 34.0\t5.0 \u00b1 0.7\nTotal cholesterol (mg/dL)\t202.1 \u00b1 38.2\t182.8 \u00b1 34.7 *\nLDL cholesterol (mg/dL)\t124.1 \u00b1 33.4\t109.4 \u00b1 33.6 *\nHDL cholesterol (mg/dL)\t56.0 \u00b1 9.7\t50.8 \u00b1 10.7\nTriglycerides (mg/dL)\t93.50 (73.75\u2013122.50)\t94.50 (74.00\u2013150.5)\nInsulin (\u00b5IU/mL)\t15.4 \u00b1 5.5\t11.5 \u00b1 5.1 *\nHOMA-IR index\t3.5 \u00b1 1.3\t2.3 \u00b1 0.9 *\n### Caption\nClinical, anthropometric, and blood analysis characteristics (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).\n### Footer\n* p \u2264 0.05 for comparison before and after the intensive weight loss program.

Over a period of four weeks (six treatments), we collected resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans from 30 patients before their first, third and sixth treatments. Clinical outcome showed a significantly greater Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain score (improvement) with verum acupuncture compared to the sham acupuncture. Longitudinal cortical thickness analysis showed that the cortical thickness at left posterior medial prefrontal cortex (pMPFC) decreased significantly in the sham group across treatment sessions as compared with verum group. Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis using the left pMPFC as a seed showed that after longitudinal treatments, the rsFC between the left pMPFC and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), medial frontal pole (mFP) and periaquiduct grey (PAG) are significantly greater in the verum acupuncture group as compared with the sham group. Our results suggest that acupuncture may achieve its therapeutic effect on knee OA pain by preventing cortical thinning and decreases in functional connectivity in major pain related areas, therefore modulating pain in the descending pain modulatory pathway. \n \n\n# Body\n \nOsteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health problem among the elderly and is associated with considerable disability . The knee is one of the most common body locations for OA. A recent analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III) indicated that about 35% of women and men aged 60 years and above had radiographic knee OA . \n\nOA is a complex chronic pain condition due in part to both nociceptive and neuropathic mechanisms . Previous studies have demonstrated central sensitization in osteoarthritis patients , increased activity in the periaqueductal grey (PAG) matter associated with stimulation of the skin in referred pain areas of patients , and increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in pain related brain regions including the primary and secondary somatosensory, insula, cingulate cortices, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and PAG , indicating pathology of the central nervous system in knee OA patients. \n\nDespite the high prevalence rate of OA, the treatment of OA is far from satisfactory . Pharmacological treatment of knee OA is often ineffective with unwanted and dangerous side effects . Acupuncture is a component of the \u201cTraditional Chinese Medicine\u201d (TCM) system. Multiple randomized clinical trials have suggested that knee OA patients can benefit from acupuncture treatment . However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of acupuncture treatment in knee OA patients are still poorly understood. \n\nAs a unique treatment modality, studies have shown that acupuncture may produce an analgesic effect through the endogenous descending pain modulatory system . Brain imaging studies have also shown that acupuncture needle stimulation  can evoke widespread brain activity changes and modulate the functional connectivity (FC) of the pain processing network , which opens a new window to understand the central mechanism of acupuncture treatment. \n\nIn parallel, investigators have found abnormal brain structures  or disrupted FC  in patients with various chronic pain disorders. \n\nMore recently, accumulating evidence suggest that the disrupted brain structure and functional connectivity can be reversed after successful treatment. For instance, Seminowicz and colleagues  found that cLBP is associated with decreased cortical thickness and abnormal activity during attention-demanding tasks in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Most intriguingly, after successful treatment of back pain, both cortical thickness and functional connectivity (FC) of the DLPFC were normalized. In another study, the investigators  found that gray matter volume decreases within the left thalamus in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip; these thalamic volume changes reverse after hip arthroplasty and are associated with decreased pain and increased function. \n\nIn the present study, we investigated changes in cortical thickness and functional connectivity in knee OA patients across longitudinal acupuncture treatments. All patients were randomized to receive either verum or sham acupuncture. Using a longitudinal treatment design , each patient received 6 acupuncture treatments over 4 weeks. We collected brain structure and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans during the first, third and sixth treatments ( ). We also administered the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)  before and after the six-session acupuncture treatment period. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThe Institutional Review Board at Massachusetts General Hospital approved all study procedures. The experiment was performed in accordance with approved guidelines. All subjects who enrolled in this study provided written informed consent before beginning any study procedure. We debriefed all subjects at the end of the study. \n\n\n### Patient recruitment and inclusion criteria \n  \nWe recruited acupuncture na\u00efve patients aged 40\u201370 with a diagnosis of chronic osteoarthritis (OA) in the right and/or left knee from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and the greater Boston area. \n\nSubjects exhibiting Grade 2 or Grade 3 OA as defined by the Kellgren-Lawrence Scale used for radiographically grading knee OA were included in the study. We excluded subjects who: 1) had undergone any interventional procedures for knee pain within 6 months prior to enrolling in the study, 2) intended to undergo surgery during the time of involvement in the study, 3) experienced knee pain due to causes other than OA, such as inflammation or malignancy, 4) had received a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis or other leg-related pain disorders, 5) were taking opioids, benzodiazepines, or other medications that may influence brain imaging outcomes, or 6) presented MRI contraindications. All enrolled OA patients had an endogenous average pain intensity rating of >2 on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) scale at the first visit. \n\n\n### Experimental design \n  \nAll subjects, regardless of the presence of bilateral or unilateral pain, received treatment on the knee that presented them with the most severe pain. We stratified subjects by knee and randomized them into one of three groups: high dose real acupuncture (6 acupoints), low dose real acupuncture (2 acupoints), or high dose sham acupuncture (6 non-acupoints with Streitberger placebo needles) ( ). Subjects were randomized using a block design generated by a biostatistician blind to the treatment mode. Only the acupuncturist was not blinded. This study was designed to investigate whether the number of needles (acu points) influences the treatment effect. Therefore, we included two groups receiving real acupuncture treatments with different numbers of acu points, but identical stimulation paradigm. \n\nAfter an initial screening session, each subject engaged in a total of 6 acupuncture treatment sessions in one month (twice per week for the first two weeks, once per week for the last two weeks). Treatments 1, 3 and 6 occurred during a scan session with the patient lying in a 3-Tesla MRI scanner while we acquired fMRI data. All other treatments occurred in our behavioral testing room. \n\n\n### Acupuncture administration \n  \nEach acupuncture treatment session lasted about 25 minutes for subjects in both the verum and sham acupuncture groups. The two acupoints selected for the low dose acupuncture group (ST35 and Xi yan (extra point)) were located near the knee. Each acupoint was stimulated a total of twelve times. The high dose acupuncture group received treatment at four additional acupoints (GB34, SP9, GB39 and SP6) (see  ) and each acupoint was stimulated 4 times. The locations of all acupoints were based on the text book of Chinese Acupuncture . All these points are well documented for the treatment of knee pain . \n\nFor subjects receiving sham acupuncture, the acupuncturist applied placebo needles  at six non-acupoints using a paradigm identical to that of the high dose verum needle administration. Rather than penetrating the skin as a verum needle does, the sham needle retracts up the handle shaft when the acupuncturist presses it against the skin. Sham point 1 was located 1.5\u2005cun posterior and inferior to GB4, sham points 2\u20133 were located 1.5\u2005cun and 3\u2005cun inferior to sham point 1, sham point 4 was located 1\u2005cun posterior to the midpoint of K9 and K10, and sham 5\u20136 were located 1.5\u2005cun inferior and superior to the sham point 4 respectively. All sham points were located on the lower leg where no meridians pass ( ). \n\nFor all treatments, the acupuncturist placed a small plastic ring over the point and secured the ring with a thin strip of sterile plastic tape ensuring patient blindness to the actual site of needle insertion and thus blindness to whether the treatment was verum or sham. During acupuncture, the acupuncturist stimulated one point at a time in a predetermined order, each for 10 seconds with 30-second breaks between each acupoint. ( ). The total treatment and stimulation time for all three groups was the same. We randomized the specific starting acupoint across patients, but held it constant throughout all sessions for each individual patient. For consistency, we kept leg position, acupoint location, and needling parameters (1\u20132\u2005cm depth for all points, all needles were evenly rotated approximately 120 rotations per minute, we also attempted to produce moderate deqi sensations on a 0\u201310 scale) constant across groups. In the fMRI sessions, the treatment spanned two 9-minute acupuncture/fMRI scans followed by Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) rating. \n\nAs a treatment quality control, we measured the deqi sensation evoked by two separate acupuncture stimulation periods, one midway through the treatment and one at the end of the treatment, using the MASS . \n\n\n### Clinical outcomes \n  \nWe measured clinical outcomes using the KOOS , which is comprised of 5 subscales: 1) pain, 2) other symptoms, 3) function in daily living (ADL), 4) function in sport and recreation, and 5) knee-related quality of life (QOL). Each subscale allows for calculation of a normalized score, with 0 denoting the most extreme symptoms/pain and 100 denoting no symptoms/pain . Based on previous studies , we selected the KOOS pain subscale and function in daily living subscale as our primary outcome measures. We used all other subscale measurements as secondary outcomes. Trained research assistants, blinded to treatment mode, administered the KOOS to all patients at baseline (up to one week prior to the first treatment) and again after the final treatment. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nEach subject participated in three identical fMRI scanning sessions. Scan 1 (treatment 1) and scan 2 (treatment 3) were separated by approximately 7 days; scan 2 and scan 3 (treatment 6) were separated by approximately 18 days. We used a 3-axis gradient head coil in a 3-Tesla Siemens MRI system equipped for echo planar imaging (EPI). Each fMRI session included an anisotropic magnetization prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) structural sequence followed by a 6-minute resting state fMRI. The MPRAGE scanning parameters included TR of 2200\u2005ms, echo time of 9.8\u2005ms, flip angle of 7, field-of-view of 230\u2005mm , slice thickness of 1.2\u2005mm. For the resting state, the scan acquisition included 47 slices with a thickness of 3\u2005mm, a TR of 3000\u2005ms, a TE of 30\u2005ms, flip angle of 85 degrees, field of view of 216\u2005mm  and a 3 \u00d7 3-mm in-plane spatial resolution. Following the first resting state fMRI, we conducted two functional scans during the 25-minute acupuncture administration and a second resting state scan following acupuncture administration ( ). \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Brain structure analysis using FreeSurfer \n  \nAutomated cortical surface reconstruction was performed on the T1 MPRAGE scans in FreeSurfer version 5.1 ( ) using previously described methods . Freesurfer's Longitudinal Processing Stream  was used to analyze the cortical changes between groups. The longitudinal processing stream creates an unbiased within-subject template space and image  using robust, inverse consistent registration . The template is used as an estimate to initialize subsequent segmentation processes for each time point, providing within-subject common information regarding anatomical structures. Several processing steps, such as skull stripping, Talaraich transforms, atlas registration as well as spherical surface maps and parcellations are then initialized with common information from this template, something which significantly increases reliability and statistical power . \n\nHere, the unbiased template was created for each subject using the three T1 MPRAGE scans collected over the course of one month. Any inaccuracies in the reconstruction of white matter and pial surfaces of individual subjects were visually inspected using the template reconstruction. Any inaccuracies identified by visual inspection were manually corrected on the template and applied to each of the three longitudinal scans. Cortical thickness was then computed for each longitudinal scan as the distance between the pial and white matter surfaces at each point across the cortical mantle. \n\nGroup analyses were performed by resampling each subject's data to the FreeSurfer average atlas, distributed as a part of the FreeSurfer software package. A standard General Linear Model (GLM) was used to compare the rate of change of cortical thickness between the verum and sham groups at each point across the cortical mantle. \n\nSimilar to our previous studies , we used an initial uncorrected threshold of p < 0.005 and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with a FWHM of 10\u2005mm in group analysis. A threshold of corrected p values (p \u2264 0.05) as obtained by using a Monte Carlo simulation cluster-wise correction with 10000 permutations was further applied. \n\nAfter computing the cortical thickness of the left posterior medial prefrontal cortex (pMPFC) for all 30 patients, repeated measurements was done to test for interactions between acupuncture mode (verum vs. sham) and time (across all three treatment sessions) using SPSS 18.0 Software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To eliminate the effect of possible confounding factors, the analysis was repeated using age and duration as covariates of no interest. \n\n\n#### Seed based functional connectivity analysis \n  \nThe fMRI data were preprocessed using Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) software (available at:  )  implemented in a MATLAB suite (Mathworks, Inc, Natick, Massachusetts). The software is based on Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) ( ) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit ( ) . \n\nThe fMRI images were slice timing corrected, head-motion corrected, coregistered to respective structural images for each subject, segmented, regressed out 6 rigid body motion, white matter, and CSF signal, normalized by using structural image unified segmentation, and then re-sampled to 3-mm cubic voxels. After linear detrending, data was filtered using typical temporal bandpass (0.01\u20130.08\u2005Hz) to remove low frequency noise (including slow scanner drifts) and influences of higher frequencies reflecting cardiac and respiratory signals. Finally, similar to our previous study , the data was smoothed using a full width half maximum of 6\u2005mm. \n\nFunctional connectivity analysis for individual subjects was carried out in DPARSF by applying a seed-region approach using the left pMPFC (x = 8, y = 40, z = 39, with 5\u2005mm radius) that showed significant cortical thickness difference between the real and sham acupuncture as seed (see  ). Next, the averaged time course was obtained from the seed and the correlation analysis was performed in a voxel-wise way to generate the FC map. The correlation coefficient map was converted into Fisher-Z map by Fisher's r-to-z transform to improve the normality by calling functions in REST. \n\nTo investigate the functional connectivity of left pMPFC at a group level, individual Fisher-Z functional connectivity maps obtained from the functional connectivity analysis in DPARSF were used in the second level analysis using SPM8 software (available at:  ). \n\nTo study the modulation effect of acupuncture treatment, we compared the changes in pre-acupuncture treatment 6 and pre-acupuncture treatment 1 in the verum group to that of the sham group. We used pre-acupuncture resting state fMRI to avoid the residual effect of acupuncture needle stimulation . Due to the small sample size of each group (10 patients), we decided to combine the two verum acupuncture groups (low and high dose groups) because 1) the total treatment time, needle stimulation time, and reported sensations were the same in both verum groups, and 2) we found no clinical outcome differences between the two verum acupuncture groups; both verum acupuncture groups trended towards improvement when compared to sham treatment. \n\nSpecifically, to explore the difference between verum and sham after longitudinal acupuncture treatments, we input individual Fisher-Z maps from FC analyses for each subject into a full factorial model with two factors. The first factor had two levels (high and low dose verum acupuncture, and sham acupuncture) and the second factor had three levels (treatment 1, treatment 3, and treatment 6). Next, the contrast was created to look at the difference of differences, the first difference is FC changes between pre-acupuncture treatment 6 and pre-acupuncture treatment 1 for verum and sham acupuncture groups respectively, the second difference is FC changes between verum and sham group. \n\nWe used an initial threshold of p < 0.005 uncorrected with 10 voxels. We also report corrected p values as obtained from small volume correction in a priori regions of interest at a level of p \u2264 0.05 with FWE peak correction. Coordinates for small volume correction were based on peak coordinates obtained from previous studies on pain processing and pain modulation. The PAG , the ventral striatum  were corrected using spheres of 4\u2005mm radius. The anterior MPFC  and the pregenual rostral anterior cingular cortex (rACC)  were corrected using spheres of 9\u2005mm radius. \n\nConnectivity Fisher-Z values were extracted from areas surviving small volume correction for all groups and sessions. Repeated measurement was then performed using SPSS 18.0 Software to test for interaction between verum and sham group across treatment sessions. To eliminate the effect of possible confounding factors, all data analysis were repeated using age and duration as covariates of no interest. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nForty-four acupuncture na\u00efve patients (19 females) aged 43\u201370 with a diagnosis of chronic osteoarthritis in the right and/or left knee participated in the study. Of the 44 patients who enrolled, 30 (13 females) completed all study procedures. Fourteen subjects did not complete the study due to problems with scheduling (6), ineligibility at screening (3), disinterest (2), claustrophobia (1), or inability to adhere to study requirements in scanner (2). Of the 14 subjects who dropped out of the study, four dropped out after randomization (2 from the low dose verum acupuncture group (one due to inability to adhere to study requirements in scanner, one due to schedule conflict) and 2 from the high dose verum acupuncture group (due to schedule conflict)). \n\n### Sensation evoked by acupuncture treatment \n  \nAs a treatment quality control, we measured the deqi sensation evoked by acupuncture treatment using the Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) . The average total MASS score (sum of the intensities of each sensation) differed significantly across the acupuncture treatment groups (high (12.95 \u00b1 7.55) vs. low (15.22 \u00b1 11.90) vs. sham (4.82 \u00b1 3.79)) (  F  (2,27) = 4.21, p = .026). Post hoc analyses showed the following differences: high vs low p = 0.55, high vs sham p = 0.04; low vs sham p = 0.01. These results indicate that verum acupuncture can produce significantly stronger sensations compared to sham acupuncture. There was no significant difference between the high and low dose acupuncture groups. A previous study by our group reported more details regarding the deqi sensations evoked by different treatment modalities in this sample . \n\n\n### Clinical outcomes \n  \nBaseline characteristics for the 30 patients who completed all study procedures are detailed in  . Two sample t-tests indicated no significant differences in clinical outcomes between the high and low dose groups for any of the KOOS subscale changes (post-treatment \u2013 pre-treatment) and both of the verum groups showed trends of improvements in the pain and other subscale scores when compared to the sham group ( ). Since the treatment duration and stimulation time, acupuncture needle-evoked sensation and the changes of clinical outcomes are similar between the high and low dose verum acupuncture groups, we pooled the data from these two groups to increase our power when comparing the differences between verum and sham acupuncture. \n\nRepeated measurements show that there was a significant interaction between acupuncture mode (verum vs. sham) and time (baseline vs. endpoint) for pain (F(1,28) = 5.596, p = .025, significant after Bonferroni correction) and a trend for function in daily living (F(1,28) = 3.223, p = .083). In addition, we found that secondary outcomes (KOOS subscale score for function in sport (F(1,27) = 4.252, p = .049) and quality of life (F(1, 28) = 4.682, p = .039) showed significant improvement in the real acupuncture group after treatment compared to the sham group. \n\n\n### Cortical thickness analysis: comparing verum to sham group \n  \nOf all 30 subjects, 27 (9 in sham acupuncture group) have all brain structure data at three time points for analysis. Cluster analysis showed significant difference between the verum and sham acupuncture groups at left pMPFC ( ). \n\nTo further explore the cortical thickness change in different groups, we extracted the peak vertex of pMPFC in each subjects across three sessions. Results showed that the cortical thickness remained static for the verum group across all three treatments sessions, but decreased for sham group ( ). Repeated measurements on the extracted data show that there was a highly significant interaction between acupuncture mode (verum vs. sham) and time (across all three treatment sessions) for cortical thickness of left pMPFC (F(2,24) = 7.519, p = 0.003). After control for age and duration, the interaction remains significant (F(2,22) = 7.461, p = 0.003). \n\n\n### Functional connectivity: comparing verum to sham group \n  \nUsing the left pMPFC that we obtained in structural analysis as a seed, we applied whole brain functional connectivity analysis comparing changes from pre-acupuncture treatment 1 to that of pre-acupuncture treatment 6 between the verum and sham groups. The FWE corrected P value, Fisher-Z value, and peak coordinates for all regions are shown in  . There is significantly stronger connectivity between the left pMPFC and PAG, rACC, anterior MPFC and ventral striatum for verum acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture after longitudinal acupuncture treatment ( ). When extracting the Fisher-Z connectivity values in these regions using the peak coordinates and a 4\u2005mm sphere around the peak for all groups, repeated measurements show that there was a highly significant interaction between acupuncture mode (verum vs. sham) and time (across all three treatment sessions) for PAG (F(2,27) = 8.637, p = 0.001), rACC (F(2,27 = 8.885, p = 0.001), ventral striatum (F(2,27) = 3.931, p = 0.032), and anterior MPFC (F(2,27) = 6.927, p = 0.004). After using age and duration of the disorder as covariates of no interest, and repeat the analysis, all findings remain significant. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we investigated the effects of longitudinal acupuncture treatment on structural and functional brain changes and clinical outcome measurements in knee OA patients. The results showed that acupuncture treatment can significantly modulate cortical thickness, functional connectivity, and clinical KOOS pain rating in OA patients. \n\nSpecifically, we found that the cortical thickness of left pMPFC decreased in sham group, but stayed the same in the verum group ( ). Previous studies  have found the region involved in conditioning placebo analgesia. Literature  suggest that the posterior region of the MPFC seems to be involved in control and monitoring of action. Other studies also suggest that the MPFC may integrate information from the external environment with stored internal representations , control top-down attention during conflict processing of alternative responses , and control monitor conflict with subsequent adjustment in performance . \n\nCortical thickness, especially that of the frontal region, dramatically declines with age . Also, the cortical thinning process is accentuated in chronic pain population . Our result suggest that the acupuncture may have prevented the natural rapid cortical thinning process of Knee OA patients by increasing the ability of the left pMPFC to control and modulate one's pain experience, which ultimately decreased the subjects' experience of pain. We observed cortical thickness decrease after one month of treatment, which is comparable in change in brain structure and duration of treatment with other published results . \n\nTo further explore other brain areas involved in pain modulation, we used the left posterior MPFC obtained from cortical thickness change as a seed for functional connectivity analysis. We found that comparing resting state functional connectivity changes from pre-acupuncture treatment 1 to that of pre-acupuncture treatment 6 between the verum and sham groups, the verum group showed stronger left posterior MPFC connectivity with the PAG, the right ventral striatum, the anterior MPFC, and the pregenual part of rostral ACC than did the sham group after longitudinal acupuncture treatments ( ). When extracting connectivity values from these regions and compared between verum and sham, there is significant interactions between verum and sham across all three sessions for all regions. \n\nDiffusion tensor imaging showed that the pMPFC has strong anatomical and functional connections with the anterior MPFC and ACC . The MPFC/rACC (including the pre-genual and sub-genual ACC) is a key region involved in the descending pain modulatory system . Studies also have shown that in knee OA patients, the lateral prefrontal cortex, the rACC, the bilateral insula, the parietal operculum, and the limbic cortical areas are involved in altered pain processing in OA . This suggests that the MPFC/rACC is a main area involved in the OA pain circuit. It also forms a core network with the PAG and the RVM (ACC-PAG-RVM network) for pain modulation even in the absence of a painful stimulus . Recent studies have shown that the functional connectivity fluctuations and structural connectivity between the PAG and the rACC predicted the mind wandering away from pain . \n\nVentral striatum is involved in processing many types of rewards including analgesia. Studies have shown the role of ventral striatum/accumbens in anticipation of analgesia . In a previous study, investigators found that the magnitude opioid analgesia indicated by pain rating changes can be predicted by neuronal response to painful noxious stimuli in nucleus accumbens/ventral striatum before administration of remifentanil . Taken together, these results highlight the role of reward network such as ventral striatum in opioid related pain modulation. \n\nOn top of the structural and functional connectivity changes, we also found that the verum group showed less clinical KOOS pain after acupuncture treatment compared with sham group, indicating acupuncture is an effective method at treating knee OA. In light of the above findings and previous studies  on the mechanisms involved in acupuncture analgesia demonstrating the involvement of the pain descending modulatory system, we speculate that by maintaining the structural cortical thickness of the left pMPFC and the connectivity between the left pMPFC and the pregenual rACC, anterior MPFC, right ventral striatum and PAG, the communication between these regions stays intact, which further enhance the pleasantness of rewarding stimuli, and restore the descending modulatory pathway. The ultimate result is improved clinical outcome in knee OA patients. \n\nThere are several limitations of this study. First, the sample size is relatively small. However, by combining the two acupuncture groups, we increased the power of the verum group, creating a 2:1 ratio between the verum and sham treatment conditions that will provide additional information on patients receiving active treatment . All reported main brain imaging results survived the stringent multiple comparison correction. Due to the longitudinal design of the study, we acquired fMRI scans at three time points, which may also increase the power of this study. \n\nOther potential limitations of this study include the potentially confounding effect of factors such as patient age and duration of chronic pain experienced by each patient. To address this concern, we repeated the analysis including age and duration of pain as covariates of no interest and re-analyzed the data. After this analysis, all findings remain significant. Thus, our main results do not change after controlling for these confounding factors. Furthermore, when KOOS pain scores were correlated with age and duration using multiple regression, we did not find any significant correlation. Further studies that include larger sample sizes are needed to validate the findings from our study. Finally, 6 minutes resting fMRI scans may potentially influence the test-retest reliability of seed based functional connectivity result. A longer duration of resting state scan should be applied in future study . \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn this study, we found that verum acupuncture treatment can significantly modulate cortical thickness change, clinical outcome changes and FC associated with chronic pain in knee OA patients. Our findings suggest that verum acupuncture may enhance connectivity in the descending pain modulation pathway through connection with the posterior MPFC. A better understanding of the association in structural changes, FC and clinical outcomes and how treatment can modulate FC will deepen our knowledge and may ultimately lead to the acceptance of acupuncture in the main stream medicine and the development of mechanism-based therapies for treating chronic pain. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nX.Y.C.: data analysis and manuscript preparation; R.B.S.: data collection, data analysis and manuscript preparation; K.R.: data analysis; D.O.: manuscript preparation; J.K.: experimental design, data collection, analysis and manuscript preparation. \n\n\n## Additional Information \n  \n Clinical Trial Registration   URL:  .

To date, the neurobiological basis of these deficits remains elusive. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, 17 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and 18 matched controls watched videos of an actor speaking, gesturing (unimodal), and both speaking and gesturing (bimodal) about social or non-social events in a naturalistic way. Participants were asked to judge whether each video contains person-related (social) or object-related (non-social) information. When processing social-abstract content, patients showed reduced activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) only in the gesture but not in the speech condition. For non-social-concrete content, remarkably, reduced neural activation for patients in the left postcentral gyrus and the right insula was observed only in the speech condition. Moreover, in the bimodal conditions, patients displayed improved task performance and comparable activation to controls in both social and non-social content. To conclude, patients with schizophrenia displayed modality-specific aberrant neural processing of social and non-social information, which is not present for the bimodal conditions. This finding provides novel insights into dysfunctional multimodal communication in schizophrenia, and may have potential therapeutic implications. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIn everyday social communication, humans encounter a diverse spectrum of inputs from multiple modalities ( ), which might be potentially difficult to process for patients with schizophrenia. These include non-linguistic stimuli from others\u2019 facial expressions ( ,  ), body movements, e.g., postures and gestures ( ,  ,  ), and linguistic stimuli in the form of auditory speech and written texts ( ). Importantly, the multimodal inputs comprise both social-abstract and non-social-concrete information, and patients\u2019 social functioning heavily depends on the processing of these stimuli, which serves as the basis to further mentalize social intentions and to perform appropriate social interaction ( ). To date, however, it remains elusive if the processing of these social/non-social information in schizophrenia is impaired in schizophrenia in a multimodal context. \n\nSocial cognition is known to be impaired in schizophrenia ( ). Regarding the perception of social stimuli, in particular, prior research on patients\u2019 social perception dysfunction has focused on emotional perception of faces and voices ( ,  ), whereas limited studies have investigated the perception of social-abstract information delivered via linguistic and gesture stimuli. In healthy participants, a seminal fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) study has identified distinct brain regions for processing socially and non-socially relevant linguistic information ( ): When participants were asked to judge whether visual word pairs are person\u2013 or object-related, person-related social stimuli activated the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a crucial region forming the mentalizing network ( ,  ,  ,  ). On the other hand, when processing linguistic stimuli about non-social-concrete content (e.g., words and sentences about objects), healthy participants activate regions including a left-lateralized network including the left the bilateral insula and the left parietal lobe ( ,  ). \n\nNotably, in everyday life, both types of information are also commonly conveyed via non-linguistic channels such as manual gestures. For instance, even without speech, individuals can use a \u201cbe silent\u201d emblematic gesture to deliver social information, which is commonly intransitive and symbolic; on the other hand, for describing concrete actions, transitive and object-related hand actions, i.e., pantomimes such as \u201chammering\u201d are commonly used. Moreover, it is common to use both gesture and speech together: To ask someone else to stop, one can use a \u201cstop\u201d gesture (e.g., a front-facing, raised hand) together with its verbal counterpart. Emerging basic research has investigated if the processing of social-abstract and non-social-concrete information is modality-independent: for healthy populations, social-abstract information delivered by both auditory speech and manual gesture commonly activates the mPFC and the (IFG) and middle temporal gyri ( ,  )\u2014regions that are typically activated for social cognition and abstract semantics ( ,  ). For processing non-social action and object information, literature also suggests that humans recruit modality-independent regions, such as the lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) and the pre/postcentral gyri ( ,  ,  ). \n\nThe multimodal characteristics of social/non-social information processing, as well as its supramodal neural basis, may have profound implications in schizophrenia research. Schizophrenia is characterized by well-known deficits in the comprehension and production of speech ( ,  ,  ,  ), as well as impairments in the perception and production of gesture ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Clinically, these two aspects may directly contribute to major symptoms of schizophrenia such as formal thought disorder and apraxia/catatonia respectively. They are also indicative of a range of other negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia ( ,  ), and are functionally highly relevant ( ,  ). Yet, regarding the processing of social/non-social information, it remains unknown if both processes are impaired in schizophrenia irrespective of modality, or if the impairments are modality-specific. For the processing of social-abstract information, both linguistic (visual and auditory) and gesture (social emblems) have not been investigated in schizophrenia so far. However, studies employing non-semantic hand actions have shown that patients might be impaired for gesture perception in general ( ,  ). For the processing of concrete and non-social information, a previous study shows that patients are impaired in visually presented sentences ( ). Moreover, given potential dysfunctional processing of social or non-social information in schizophrenia, it remains unclear if these deficits could be potentially compensated by multimodal inputs containing both speech and gesture: Emerging literature suggests mutual facilitation between speech and gesture, at least for healthy populations ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nTo address these remaining research questions, we conducted the current study, presenting to patients with schizophrenia and matched controls with videos of an actor communicating in a spontaneous and naturalistic manner. In these videos, the actor performs either social-abstract (person-related) or non-social (object-related) content in different modalities, where social and non-social information is perceivable in gesture- and speech-only modalities. Similar to approaches from previous research ( ,  ), we directly compared social vs. non-social videos to identify neural perception of social and non-social information in both auditory-speech and visual-gesture modalities. Additionally, we showed to participants videos with bimodal inputs (actor both speaking and gesturing). Based on previous research, we hypothesized activation of the mPFC and a left frontal-temporal network (e.g., inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus) for the processing of social-abstract information ( ). For non-social-concrete information processing, we hypothesized left-lateralized regions including the lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC), the superior temporal gyrus/sulcus (STG/STS), as well as pre/postcentral gyri forming the putative mirror neuron system ( ,  ,  ,  ). We focused directly on group differences between a group of patients suffering from schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and their age- and education-matched controls: for social content, as patients are well-known for their social cognition impairments, we expected patients to show reduced activation in the mPFC, irrespective of encoding modality ( ); For non-social content, despite mixed findings from previous neuroimaging research on hand action observation on schizophrenia ( ,  ), following previous report on dysfunctional processing of non-social linguistic stimuli in schizophrenia ( ), we hypothesized neural modulation of the object-related regions for patients with schizophrenia for both gesture and speech modalities. Additionally, based on prior basic research on mutual facilitation between gesture and speech ( ; see   for review), we hypothesized that the bimodal input could compensate for potential unimodal processing deficits, leading to improved performance in the patient group. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe summarized participants\u2019 demographic and clinical characteristics in  . Healthy controls were recruited matching age, gender, and education to patients. Seventeen patients were recruited at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Philipps University of Marburg, and were diagnosed according to ICD-10 with schizophrenia (F20.0, n\u00a0=\u00a013, and F20.3, n\u00a0=\u00a01) or schizoaffective disorder (F25.0, n\u00a0=\u00a02, and F25.2, n\u00a0=\u00a01). Participants in both groups are native speakers of German, and have no knowledge of Russian language. All except one of the patients received antipsychotic treatment; six were additionally treated with antidepressive medication (For detailed medication at the time scanning, see  ). Positive and negative symptoms were assessed with the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) ( ), and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) ( ). Eighteen age\u2013, gender\u2013, and education-matched healthy participants with no history of any mental disorders were recruited from the same area. Exclusion criteria for both groups were brain injury and neurological or other medical diseases affected by brain physiology. In both groups, we conducted neuropsychological tests to assess working memory function, digit span, trail making (TMT), verbal IQ (MWT-B) ( ), and metaphoric language processing (concretism, evaluated with the Proverb Interpretation Task) ( ). These measures are reported in  . We report, additionally, scores from word fluency test, as well as gesture production and perception (BAG, Brief Assessment of Gesture ( )) in the supplement ( ). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing. Except for one control and one patient, all other participants are right-handed ( ). All participants gave written informed consent prior to participation in the experiment and were compensated monetarily. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the School of Medicine, Philipps University Marburg.   \nDemographic, medication, symptom, and neuropsychological measures. \n    \n\n\n### Materials and procedure \n  \nWe employed a content judgement paradigm from previous studies from our research group to investigate modality-specific processing of social/non-social information ( ,  ,  ), which has elicited dissociable but supramodal neural processing of social-abstract and non-social-concrete information in a healthy student sample ( ). Of note, the same fMRI dataset has been published with an unrelated research question ( ). We showed to participants five-second videos of an actor spontaneously communicating both social-abstract (S) and non-social-concrete (N) events in the following modalities: 1) incomprehensible Russian sentences with gestures. This is considered as a gesture-only (G) condition because social feature is only available to participants in the gesture form. 2) comprehensible German sentences (S) without any gestures. Additionally, we also showed to participants 3) German sentences with accompanying gestures as a bimodal input condition (B). A filler condition is also included with videos of incomprehensible Russian sentences with meaningless gestures. An example of both a social (S) and non-social (N) bimodal videos is illustrated in  A. For a complete list of all videos, please refer to Appendix in  .   \nPanel A: Picture illustration for social-abstract (S) and non-social-concrete (N) videos in the bimodal condition (B). The same stimuli were also presented in two additional modalities: gestures with foreign Russian sentences (G) and German sentences without any gestures (S). For illustrative purposes, the spoken German sentences were translated into English, and all spoken sentences were written into speech bubbles. Panel B: Illustration of a sample trial. Participants performed a content judgment task for each video, indicating via button press whether a stimulus was either person\u2013 or object-related. \n  \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nAltogether, 312 experimental video slips (26 videos per condition\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06 conditions\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 sets) were included in the study. For each participant, an experimental session comprised 182 videos from one set of videos (156 critical videos and 26 filler videos), and consisted of two 14-minute runs. Each run contained 91 trials with a matched number of items from each condition. The stimuli were presented in an event-related design in pseudo-randomized order. Within each trial, each video-clip was followed by a gray background with a variable duration of 2154\u20135846\u00a0ms (jitter average: 4000\u00a0ms), as illustrated in  B. Participants performed a content judgement task for each video ( ,  ), indicating via button press (with their left hand) whether a stimulus was either person\u2013 or object-related. Participants were instructed to respond to the task as soon as they had decided on an answer. \n\n\n### fMRI acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nAll images were acquired using a 3\u00a0T MRI scanner (Siemens MRT Trio series). The functional images were obtained using a T2*-weighted echo-planar image sequence (TR\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0s, TE\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0ms, flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0, slice thickness\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0mm, interslice gap\u00a0=\u00a00.36\u00a0mm, field of view\u00a0=\u00a0230\u00a0mm, matrix\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064, voxel size\u00a0=\u00a03.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04.0\u00a0mm, 30 axial slices orientated parallel to the AC-PC line, ascending order). Two runs of 425 volumes each were acquired during the experiment. Additionally, simultaneous EEG data from the participants were also collected for other analyses not relevant for the current study, and are therefore not further discussed here. MR images were preprocessed using the SPM12 software package (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Welcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London, UK) based on Matlab R2017a (version 9.2.0; MathWorks): after discarding the first five volumes to minimize T1-saturation effects, all images were spatially and temporally realigned, and normalized into the MNI space using the MNI template (resulting voxel size 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0mm), smoothed (8\u00a0mm isotropic Gaussian filter), and high-pass filtered (cut-off period 128\u00a0s). \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nWe performed statistical whole-brain analysis in a two-level, mixed-effects procedure. On the first level, single-participant BOLD responses were modeled by a design matrix comprising the onset time points of each event (critical word of each sentence as used in the previous event-related fMRI and EEG studies, e.g., ( ,  ,  ,  ,  )), with a duration of 5\u00a0s for all experimental conditions. The micro-time onset was set to the average time bin (8 of 16) to align the onset vector to the slice in the middle of the brain. For all conditions, the duration of speech and gesture was used as parameters of no interests on a single trial level. Six movement regressors (three rotations and three translations) were entered in the single participant\u2019s model to account for movement-induced effects on fMRI results. HRF was defined as the canonical HRF. Contrasts images against implicit baseline for all experimental conditions were used as summary measures and were included in the between-group analysis. We applied a flexible factorial analysis of variance using condition as main effect. We applied a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the cluster extent threshold to correct for multiple comparisons, ( ,  ), which has been used in comparable studies in our laboratory on social perception of multimodal stimuli ( ). For all statistical comparisons, the whole-brain activation was simulated assuming a voxel type-I error activation of p\u00a0<\u00a0.05, this revealed a cluster extent of 2268 contiguous resampled voxels as sufficient to correct for multiple comparisons at p\u00a0<\u00a0.0167 (Bonferroni-corrected for three independent tests for interaction within three independent modalities, with 0.05/3). We also reported in activation tables uncorrected cluster p-values and marked significance for cluster-level FWE correction. The reported voxel coordinates of activation peaks are located in MNI space. For the anatomical localization, functional data were referenced to the AAL toolbox ( ). \n\nFirstly, we tested three-way interaction of group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0modality\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0content. We then conducted, within each modality, interaction analyses to investigate group differences in the processing of social or non-social conditions, and masked the respective results based the contrast image from the first analysis, to reveal modality-specific group interaction. In addition, within each modality, for each group, we conducted pair-wise comparison between social and non-social conditions (S\u00a0>\u00a0N and N\u00a0>\u00a0S), for illustrating modality\u2013 and group-specific brain activations for either social or non-social information processing. In the end, following our hypotheses on bimodal enhancement for patients, within patients, we tested the interaction between modalities on social vs. non-social content processing, so as to reveal how bimodal stimuli might compensate potential neural processing deficits for patients with schizophrenia. Results of this analysis is reported in  . \n\nBased on the literature showing a potential relationship between symptom severity (especially negative symptoms) and social/non-social cognition ( ,  ), as well as gesture processing ( ,  ), for patients with schizophrenia, we conducted exploratory correlation analysis, probing for the potential relationship between clinical measures and brain activation in areas that are relevant to social/non-social information processing. To this end, spearman correlation analyses (uncorrected) were conducted between 1) parameter estimates from clusters showing significant group difference for either social or non-social conditions, 2) behavioral measures (reaction times and accuracy) for each experimental condition, and 3) scores from sum/general and subscales of SAPS and SANS. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nHealthy controls and patients with schizophrenia were instructed to indicate via button press whether the actor in the video described a person-related content or an object-related content. Correct responses (percentage correct) and their reaction times were analyzed each with mixed ANOVA [within factors: CONTENT (social vs. non-social) and MODALITY (bimodal vs. gesture vs. speech); between factor: GROUP (control vs. patient)]. Descriptive statistics for each experimental condition for both groups were provided in  .   \nAccuracy and reaction times (RT) for the behavioral task. \n    \n\nFor accuracy, we observed three main effects despite, but no interaction with GROUP (F \u00a0=\u00a00.83, p\u00a0=\u00a00.44, \u03b7 G\u00a0=\u00a00.003): Patients were significantly less accurate than healthy controls (F \u00a0=\u00a05.18, p\u00a0=\u00a0.03, \u03b7 G\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Non-social videos were judged more accurately than social videos (F \u00a0=\u00a019.75, p\u00a0=\u00a0.0001, \u03b7 G\u00a0=\u00a00.18). Additionally, accuracy between the three modalities was different (F \u00a0=\u00a014.53, p\u00a0=\u00a0.00001, \u03b7 G\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Post-hoc pairwise   t  -test showed that the accuracy for the bimodal conditions were highest (vs. gesture, t\u00a0=\u00a05.81, p\u00a0=\u00a0.000001; vs. speech, t\u00a0=\u00a02.77, p\u00a0=\u00a0.007). The accuracy for the speech conditions was also higher than the gesture conditions (t\u00a0=\u00a02.14, p\u00a0=\u00a0.035). \n\nFor reaction times, there were also three main effects, but no interaction with GROUP (F \u00a0=\u00a00.75, p\u00a0=\u00a00.47, \u03b7 G\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Patients were generally slower than healthy controls (F \u00a0=\u00a019.64, p\u00a0=\u00a0.00001, \u03b7 G\u00a0=\u00a00.35). Reaction times for non-social content were faster than social content (F \u00a0=\u00a08.63, p\u00a0=\u00a0.005, \u03b7 G\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Additionally, reaction times for the three modalities were different (F \u00a0=\u00a010.14, p\u00a0=\u00a0.0001, \u03b7 G\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Post-hoc pairwise   t  -test showed that the reaction time for gesture modality was significantly slower than the other modalities (|t| \u00a0=\u00a04.03, p \u00a0=\u00a00.0001), and there was no significant difference between the bimodal and the speech modalities (t\u00a0=\u00a00.21, p\u00a0=\u00a0.82). \n\nThe results from the behavioral task showed that patients with schizophrenia were generally slower and less accurate in the content judgement task. Additionally, the responses for non-social videos were faster and more accurate. With regard to modality, responses in the bimodal conditions were the most accurate and the fastest. However, it has to be noted that, due to the limited sample size (see Discussion), we refrain from elaborating on the interpretation of the observed behavioral effects. \n\n\n### fMRI results \n  \n#### Social-abstract (S)\u00a0>\u00a0Non-social-concrete (N) \n  \nWe report whole-brain fMRI results for S\u00a0>\u00a0N comparisons in   and  . For the speech conditions (SS\u00a0>\u00a0NS), healthy controls activated an extensive fronto-temporal-parietal network including the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the temporal lobe, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and mPFC, and the left supramarginal gyrus; patients revealed similar regions for this comparison, and we observed no group difference for social\u00a0>\u00a0non-social speech. For the gesture conditions (SG\u00a0>\u00a0NG), controls activated the bilateral PFC and IFG; patients activated the bilateral prefrontal cortex. Group interaction (Control (SG\u00a0>\u00a0NG)\u00a0>\u00a0Patient (SG\u00a0>\u00a0NG)) suggests that patients showed reduced activation in the mPFC and the anterior cingulate cortex for the social gesture condition when compared to controls ( B). In the bimodal condition (SB\u00a0>\u00a0NB), both controls and patients activated regions similar to that of the speech condition. For patients, we additionally reported modality*content interaction in the  , which shows that patients\u2019 aberrant processing of social gestures is improved in the bimodal modality.   \nActivation maps for social-abstract\u00a0>\u00a0non-social-concrete videos (S\u00a0>\u00a0N).

Cluster-level uncorrected p-value is provided for each cluster, asterisk indicates significance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) with cluster-level FWE correction. \n  \n\n\n#### Non-social-concrete (N)\u00a0>\u00a0Social-abstract (S) \n  \nWe report whole-brain fMRI results for N\u00a0>\u00a0S comparisons in   and  . For the speech conditions (NS\u00a0>\u00a0SS), healthy controls activated the left pre/postcentral gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and the left insula, whereas patients did not reveal any significant activations for this comparison. The group interaction (Control (NS\u00a0>\u00a0SS)\u00a0>\u00a0Patient (NS\u00a0>\u00a0SS)) suggests that, when compared to controls, patients showed reduced activation in the left postcentral gyrus and the right insula for the processing of non-social content in the speech-only modality (see  B). For gesture conditions (NG\u00a0>\u00a0SG), controls showed increased activation for the non-social content in the bilateral posterior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and occipital cortices, as well as the left pre/postcentral gyrus and the left insula. Patients also activated the bilateral posterior temporal gyrus and occipital lobe, as well as the left pre/postcentral gyrus. The group interaction revealed no significant clusters. For bimodal conditions (NB\u00a0>\u00a0SB), both controls and patients activated regions that are comparable to that of the gesture conditions. Additionally, for patients, bimodal input seems to enhance their aberrant processing of non-social speech, as reported in  .   \nActivation maps for non-social-concrete\u00a0>\u00a0social-abstract videos (N\u00a0>\u00a0S).

Additionally, SANS 1 (flat affect) and SANS 2 (alogia) scores correlate negatively with the accuracy for the NS condition (SANS 1: r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.62, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008, power\u00a0=\u00a00.79,  B; SANS 2: r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.63, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006, power\u00a0=\u00a00.82,  C).   \nSignificant negative correlations between patients\u2019 accuracy for the NS condition and A) patients\u2019 SANS composite scores, B) their SANS 1 (flat affect) scores, and C) their SANS 2 (alogia) scores. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWith an fMRI study on the perception of social-abstract and non-social-concrete stimuli in auditory-speech, visuo-gestural, and bimodal modalities, we observed modality-specific neural modulation in schizophrenia: In comparison to controls, reduced neural activity in patients was observed only for social gesture and non-social speech. Moreover, in the bimodal condition, neural activation for both social and non-social contents was comparable in patients and controls. \n\n### Social information processing in schizophrenia \n  \nIn the current study, patients showed dissociable neural modulation during the processing of social content in speech and gesture modalities. In the speech modality, both controls and patients activated a left-lateralized set of brain regions, including the dlPFC, mPFC, the IFG, the temporal lobe, and the angular/supramarginal gyrus, without any group difference. This finding replicates results from our previous study showing supramodal social-abstract processing of healthy individuals ( ), and is consistent with earlier studies in basic research on the role of the mPFC in both perceiving social-related stimuli and mentalizing social intentions ( ,  ,  ). The observed left IFG and temporal lobe activation is also in line with the literature on the neural substrates of abstract vs. concrete semantics ( ,  ), as the videos in the social-abstract condition, irrespective of modality, are more abstract than the non-social, object-related condition. The fact that we did not find any group differences in social-abstract speech processing suggests that patients with schizophrenia exhibit intact neural processing of social content presented in this modality. This finding complies with a previous language study in schizophrenia, in which patients also activated a comparable left fronto-temporal network to controls when they processed abstract vs. concrete visual sentences ( ). Together, although schizophrenia is well-known for its social cognition deficits ( ), as well as impairments in the perception of affective face or pitch ( ,  ,  ), patient\u2019s processing of social speech may remain intact. In the gesture modality, however, although patients activated the mPFC for the social vs. non-social stimuli, this activation was reduced when compared to controls. Notably, such modality-specific neural modulation is, for the first time, reported for social information processing in schizophrenia. Notably, in addition to the mPFC modulation, in schizophrenia, we did not observe the activation for social gestures in the left IFG. The left IFG has been linked to motor planning of gesture ( ); and, together with the DLPFC, left IFG activation has been shown to be modulated in schizophrenia for social gesture planning ( ). In addition to the left IFG, the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) activation was not observed for patients with schizophrenia when processing social gestures. Importantly, functional and structural aberrance in both the left IFG and MTG are highly indicative of major language deficits (e.g., formal thought disorders) in schizophrenia ( ,  ). Here, however, rather than showing a modality (speech) -specific neural modulation, our results indicate that these regions indicate a cross-modality deficit, and echo prior research on potential neural aberrance in these regions regarding integration between speech and gesture at both lower-perceptual and higher-semantic levels ( ,  ). To summarize, our results, from a processing perspective, corroborate these extant studies, showing that functional modulation in the PFC, and potentially in the left IFG and MTG, may give rise to gesture-specific social perception deficits. \n\n\n### Non-social information processing in schizophrenia \n  \nFor the processing of non-social (object-related) information, again, the neural modulation in patients showed an apparent dissociation. In the gesture modality, both controls and patients activated the bilateral occipital-parietal cortices, STG, LOTC, insula, and the pre/postcentral gyrus. In the speech modality, although these regions were similarly activated in controls, their brain activation was significantly reduced for patients. The group comparison suggests reduced activation in schizophrenia patients in the bilateral insula and the left postcentral gyrus for non-social speech. Of note, the observed regions for non-social and object-related information processing overlap with regions considered as part of the putative mirror neuron network, which is not only important for action observation and imitation, but also for the understanding of object- and motor-related features in verbal form ( ,  ,  ,  ). This process would require mental simulation of sensorimotor experience ( ,  ,  ). Additionally, the LOTC is also crucially involved in the perception of biological motion, object, face, as well as tool-use ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Moreover, these regions are also reported to support the processing of concrete linguistic information ( ,  ). Our data from the control group suggest that these regions support the processing of non-social-concrete features, irrespective of encoding modality. This finding is in line with the embodiment view of action and language processing ( ,  ). With regard to the patients, we observed normal neural processing of non-social content in the gesture modality, supporting a previous study ( ), which reported intact mirror neuron activity in schizophrenia (but see ( )). However, as we also observed reduced bilateral postcentral gyrus and right insula activity for patients for non-social speech, in turn, this would imply that motor simulation, as required for processing object-related features from auditory speech, might still be impaired in schizophrenia ( ,  ). This impairment concurs with the reported deficits of schizophrenia in action imitation ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), where certain degrees of motor simulation is required. However, adding to prior research on schizophrenia\u2019s motor impairments, our results provide a more nuanced version: Motor-related semantics as delivered by pantomime does not necessarily lead to reduced neural activation in schizophrenia; rather, modulated neural activity is only observed for speech contents simulating these concrete motor-actions. Additionally, schizophrenia is commonly related to structural changes in the left insula; this region is also functionally relevant to a range of language and speech processing aberrances in schizophrenia ( ,  ,  ). Therefore, functional abnormality in this region might also contribute to the simulation of motor events with speech. In sum, our fMRI results may suggest that patients with schizophrenia are impaired in a mirror-mechanism simulating concrete-motor events with speech. \n\nIn the NS condition, we also observed negative correlation between patients\u2019 SANS composite and subscores and their task accuracy. This evidence converges with previous research, corroborating the potential role of the mirror neuron system during embodiment of non-social information (e.g., action imitation and observation), as well as its relation to the development and persistence of negative symptoms ( ,  ). Our correlational finding, although being exploratory (see 4.4), links the mirror neuron system to the reported studies showing correlation between compromised gesture performance and more severe negative symptoms ( ,  ), tentatively suggests that the theoretical link between gesture and negative symptom may partially derive from motor-simulation. Notably, in the current study, for social processing, we did no observe any correlations between brain activations / behavior and symptom measures, especially positive symptoms such as hallucinations, and positive formal thought disorders, as in  . Clearly, the exact relationship between social/non-social information processing and major symptoms of schizophrenia needs to be addressed by further research with larger samples. \n\n\n### Enhancing modality-specific information processing deficits with bimodal input \n  \nThe novelty of our findings lies in the dissociable modality-specificity concerning dysfunctional neural processing of social and non-social features. Social-abstract and non-social-concrete features are functionally and neurally dissociable at the representational level ( ,  ,  ). Besides, they might be differentially processed through either linguistic (speech) or non-linguistic (gesture) channels. It has been proposed that social-abstract concepts may be   preferentially   represented in speech, and that non-social concrete concepts are   preferentially   delivered in hand action and gesture ( ,  ). Despite this theoretical proposal, however, during comprehension, healthy participants are able to process both types of information in a supramodal manner (e.g., semantic processing with unitary core systems, irrespective of encoding modality, as in ( ,  )). For patients with schizophrenia, as they exhibit similar neural activations when processing social speech and non-social gestures to controls, this might be an indication that they are at least intact in processing these contents through a   preferred   modality at representational level. But, they might show activation reduction in relevant regions when these features are conveyed in a   non-preferred   modality, as the processing of these features would require some form of mental simulation: In the case non-social information, patients are impaired in the simulation of motor-related experience from action to language ( ); In contrast, when patients are presented with social information, they might be impaired when simulating social features encoded by hand gestures (but not with speech), as shown in their reduced mPFC activation. This observed modality-specific processing deficit might also suggest that patients, unlike controls, are not capable of processing social/non-social information in a supramodal manner like healthy participants, as reported in previous studies ( ,  ). More importantly, extending previous studies on aberrant processing of social/non-social content in schizophrenia, our results indicate that this neural deficit is not universally present for either a specific modality or content, but rather appears only in specific combinations of these two factors. \n\nDespite reduced neural processing of both social and non-social content in gesture and speech modalities, patients displayed intact neural processing of these features, as well as improved task accuracy in the bimodal conditions. This enhancement effect concurs with a line of proposals ( ), who argue for a bi-directional facilitative relation between speech and gesture (for empirical evidence, see ( ,  ,  ,  ,  )). More importantly, our finding extends previous basic research, suggesting the translational implication of this mechanism. In schizophrenia research, the past decade has witnessed substantial progress in the development of social cognitive training in schizophrenia ( ,  ), with recent innovation regarding the incorporation of social stimuli from a broader range of modalities ( ). Our findings extend these approaches, proposing potential therapeutic implications of deploying naturalistic and multimodal stimuli during social cognitive training ( ), as they might be able to normalize processing of both social and non-social information, at least at a neural level. Future research is expected to further explore whether the neural enhancements can be linked to functional outcome after social cognitive training in a multimodal setting. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nDespite new insights, our study has limitations in several aspects. Firstly, the sample size of this study (n\u00a0=\u00a017 and 18 for each group) falls within the required minimum of this type of studies ( ). Hence, the patient group was limited to medicated chronic patients, and we were thus unable to test if the neural pattern is comparable to first-episode schizophrenia ( ), and were unable to attribute the findings to schizophrenia without separating out the effects of medication. Secondly, due to the limited sample size and the exploratory nature, the findings resulted from the correlation analyses needs to be treated with caution. Thirdly, our the reported group interaction did not survive the most conservative FWE threshold. Future replications are thus necessary to validate if the observed effects are replicatable when a larger sample is possible. Lastly, we did not observe any reliable relationship between BOLD signal and behavioral results: More careful, and neurobiologically plausible behavioral tasks on the social/non-social information processing are necessary for future experiments, so that their processing deficits in schizophrenia can be better examined by clinical neuroscientists and practitioners. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nHere, in an fMRI study, we for the first time showed modality-specific neural modulation in schizophrenia when patients process social-abstract and non-social-concrete content in speech and gesture. Moreover, these deficits could be compensated when both speech and gesture were presented together. Our findings provide novel insights on dysfunctional multimodal communication in schizophrenia, and suggest potential therapeutic implications of employing multimodal social cognitive intervention in schizophrenia. \n\n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: t0005\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tPatients (n\u00a0=\u00a017)\tControls (n\u00a0=\u00a018)\tDifference (p)\nAge (years)\t33.12 (12.35)\t31.94 (10.21)\t0.76\nGender male:female\t13/4\t13/5\t\nEducation (years)\t11.82 (1.77)\t12.72 (1.36)\t0.1\nTMT A (seconds)\t31.49 (10.73)\t26.17 (9.89)\t0.14\nTMT B (seconds)\t68.56 (37.8)\t52.93 (19.58)\t0.13\nDigit Span forward\t7.94 (1.75)\t8.05 (2.43)\t0.87\nDigit Span backward\t6.35 (1.93)\t6.61 (2.50)\t0.73\nVerbal IQ\t28.8 (5.25)\t28.5 (3.79)\t0.8\n*Concretism\t1.38 (0.45)\t1.14 (0.19)\t0.048\nSAPS (global)\t15 (6.89)\t\t\nSAPS (composite) total\t22.35 (18.08)\t\t\nSAPS 1 (hallucinations)\t4.64 (6.33)\t\t\nSAPS 2 (Delusions)\t10.47 (9.37)\t\t\nSAPS 3 (Bizarre behavior)\t1.88 (2.93)\t\t\nSAPS 4 (Thought disorder)\t5.41 (7.00)\t\t\nSANS (global)\t9 (6.02)\t\t\nSANS (composite) total\t21.00 (13.63)\t\t\nSANS 1 (Flat affect)\t7.18 (6.20)\t\t\nSANS 2 (Alogia)\t3.29 (4.37)\t\t\nSANS 3 (Apathy)\t4.76 (4.51)\t\t\nSANS 4 (Anhedonia)\t4.35 (4.44)\t\t\nSANS 5 (Attention)\t1.59 (2.58)\t\t\nCPZ Equivalent\t562.52 (372.63)\t\t\n### Caption\nDemographic, medication, symptom, and neuropsychological measures.\n### Footer\nValues are presented as mean (SD).

A searchlight-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed an extensive network of frontal, basal ganglia, cingulate and limbic regions exhibiting significant predictability for autistic traits from patterns of responses to angry relative to neutral expression faces. Functional connectivity analyses revealed a genotype interaction (OXTR SNPs rs2254298, rs2268491) for coupling between the orbitofrontal cortex and mid-cingulate during angry expression processing, with a negative association between coupling and autistic traits in the risk-allele group and a positive one in the non-risk allele group. Overall, results indicate extensive emotion-specific associations primarily between patterns of neural responses to angry faces and autistic traits in regions processing motivation, reward and salience but not in early visual processing. Functional connections between these identified regions were not only associated with autistic traits but also influenced by OXTR genotype. Thus, altered patterns of neural responses to threatening faces may be a potential biomarker for autistic symptoms although modulatory influences of OXTR genotype need to be taken into account. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIndividuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) typically exhibit general problems in discriminating and responding appropriately to face emotions [ \u2013 ], although it is unclear whether problems are generalized or emotion-specific [ ,  ]. While several meta-analyses demonstrate impaired recognition across all face emotions in ASD [ ,  ], findings are not consistent, with some studies reporting problems with only negative [ ,  ] or positive [ ] emotions while others have found no evidence for impairments [ \u2013 ]. This may reflect differences in tasks and the analytical approaches used [ ,  ]. Additionally, a recent large study has reported that face emotion recognition impairments in ASD may be primarily due to a low functioning sub-group [ ]. \n\nFace emotion recognition engages diverse psychological processes involving both subcortical and cortical circuitry [ \u2013 ]. Studies on face emotion processing distinguish a \u2018core system\u2019 implicated in visual processing and an \u2018extended system\u2019 for cognitive functions. The \u2018core system\u2019 is comprised of occipito-temporal regions while the \u2018extended system\u2019 includes the parietal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventral striatum, and basal ganglia [ ,  ]. Both \u2018core\u2019 and \u2018extended\u2019 processing systems exhibit atypical responses during face emotion recognition in ASD, with hypo- and hyper-activation being reported to all or specific emotional faces, particularly in the amygdala, fusiform face area, superior temporal sulcus and mPFC [ ,  \u2013 ]. On the other hand, some studies have found no differences in neural responses to emotional faces in ASD [ ,  ] or in only in a sub-type of ASD individuals who also showed low face emotion recognition abilities and more severe symptoms [ ]. \n\nThe variability in both behavioral and neuroimaging findings for emotional face processing impairment in ASD may reflect the large heterogeneity in this disorder as well as task and analytical differences. For example, while the estimated heritability of ASD is around 60\u201370%, over 200 specific risk genes identified [ ,  ] and heterogeneity in neural responses to social or other stimuli in ASD may therefore be contributed to by differences in genotypic as well as experiential contributions. In recent years there has been increasing interest in the role of the hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin in social cognition and ASD [ ] with a number of studies having reported modulation of face emotion processing following intranasal administration of oxytocin in neurotypical individuals as well as those with ASD [ \u2013 ]. Peripheral oxytocin concentrations are decreased in children with ASD [ ], and some clinical trials have reported improved social symptoms following chronic treatment with intranasal oxytocin [ ,  \u2013 ] and increased visual attention towards emotional faces [ ]. A number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) are associated with ASD symptoms, and risk genes identified as contributing to ASD influence oxytocin signaling [ ,  ]. Evidence has repeatedly linked the polymorphisms of the OXTR gene, particularly the rs2254298, rs2268491, rs2268498, and rs53576 SNPs with autism, empathy, and social and emotional processing [ \u2013 ]. The OXTR rs53576 SNP is also associated with general sociability [ ] and variations in rs2254298 may represent a trans-diagnostic biomarker for social dysfunction [ ]. Finally, reduced amygdala and arousal responses to intranasal oxytocin are modulated by OXTR genotype (both rs53576 and rs22542980) [ ]. \n\nGiven the variability of both behavioral and neural findings reported by studies in clinical populations of ASD individuals in relation to emotion processing, and the likely contribution that the well-known heterogeneity of such individuals diagnosed with this disorder could have, the current study aimed to utilize a Research Domain Criteria (RDoc) inspired dimensional approach [ ]. To this end we aimed to establish firstly whether autistic traits per se in a large sample of neurotypical individuals (  n  \u2009=\u2009255), not diagnosed with ASD, are associated with general or emotion-specific behavioral and neural responses to face expressions (angry, fear, happy, neutral and sad) and secondly if there are modulatory influences of their OXTR genotype. For the face emotion recognition task we used an implicit task approach where participants only had to identify the sex of individual displayed to help avoid participants trying to consciously identify face emotions during presentations in the MRI scanner rather than simply process face emotion stimuli. By including a simple requirement to identify the sex of the face presented we ensured that participants paid attention to the stimuli. Explicit face emotion recognition, where participants were required to actually identify specific face emotions, was also tested subsequently outside of the scanner to provide a measure of recognition accuracy and speed. Neuroimaging analyses based on univariate approaches have inherent limitations since they can only measure associations between activity changes for specific voxels or regions, so we therefore chose to use multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) [ ]. MVPA can decode the multivariate information contained in functional patterns using a classifier. By employing a searchlight strategy with machine learning it can determine differences in the patterns of activation exhibited which are predictive of specific features of individuals using the patterns of their neural responses to stimuli and without the potential bias of prior voxel selection [ ]. We therefore used MVPA to extract information from locally distributed fMRI-based patterns of activation during performance of a face emotion task to permit a powerful fine-grained analysis of differences in extensive neural activation patterns which are predictive of autistic traits. This MVPA approach has been used in several previous studies comparing small numbers of ASD and neurotypical individuals [ ,  ] but not in large scaled ones. Given that differences in patterns of neural responses across multiple brain regions identified by MVPA are likely to be influenced their functional connectivities, we additionally used a univariate analysis to investigate these. To assess potential modulatory effects of multiple OXTR genotypes on these ASQ-associated functional connectivities we then investigated whether the ASQ associations were modulated by individual OXTR genotype by examining the influence of four SNPs associated with autism and social cognition (rs2254298, rs2268491, rs2268498, rs53576) to determine whether autistic trait (Autism spectrum quotient (ASQ)) [ ,  ] associations were genotype-dependent. \n\nOverall, we hypothesized that there would be a negative association between autistic traits and accuracy in identifying the expressions but not the sex of emotional faces and that MVPA would reveal that there are patterns of activity in both \u2018core\u2019 and \u2018extended\u2019 face processing regions in response to specific emotions which are predictive of autistic trait scores. We also hypothesized further analysis would reveal that the strength of functional connectivity between regions identified by the MVPA as predictive of autistic trait scores would be associated with these scores in an OXTR genotype-dependent manner. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \n255 neurotypical Han Chinese (male = 131; age range = 17\u201329 years, mean age   SD\u2009=\u200921.62   2.339 years) participants were enrolled (for inclusion criteria see  ). Sample size was not pre-determined but post-hoc analysis showed that this sample size achieved >90% power for a medium effect size in all types of statistical tests used in the data analysis (calculated by G*Power v3.1.9.4). Participants reported being free from current or past medical, neurological, or psychiatric conditions, and no history of head injury or MRI contraindications. All volunteers were required to abstain from alcohol, caffeine-containing drinks, cigarettes or other psychoactive substances during the 24\u2009h prior to the experiment. Before the experiment all participants provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Institutional Review Board, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China) and in accordance with the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was part of a large-scale fMRI project composed of multiple task-based paradigms investigating diverse questions including inhibitory control [ ,  ], imitation and the mirror neuron system [ ] and pain empathy [ ,  ]. In contrast to these previous studies, the current one aimed to establish associations between autistic traits and neural and behavioral responses to specific face emotions, along with modulatory effects of OXTR genotype. \n\nA total of 26 participants were excluded due to failure to complete the study (  n  \u2009=\u20096), head movement (  n  \u2009=\u200912; see fMRI data preprocessing for details) or technical failures (incomplete data,   n  \u2009=\u20098), leaving a final experimental cohort of 229 participants (males = 114). \n\n\n### Experimental procedures \n  \nThe experimental protocols are presented in Fig.  . Autistic traits were assessed by the ASQ [ ,  ] with Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 scores in the present sample being 0.744. The ASQ is a widely used measure of autistic traits in both neurotypical and ASD individuals and comprises 50 self-report questions. It is not intended as a diagnostic tool per se and total scores for the level of autistic traits are calculated from responses to questions in five different sub-domains (social skills, social communication, attention to detail, attention switching and imagination). Total ASQ scores range from 0 and 50 with higher scores representing greater autistic traits and a suggested clinical threshold of scores above 32 [ ]. All participants provided buccal swaps for analysis of OXTR (rs2254298, rs2268491, rs2268498, rs53576) genotype (see   and [ ]).    Experimental protocol and the searchlight-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA).  \n a   The experimental protocols and event-related implicit emotion recognition fMRI paradigm.   b   Illustration of the searchlight-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Three-voxel radius spherical searchlights around center voxels were employed for each contrast separately, with individual beta maps as features to predict participants\u2019 ASQ scores. The optimal hyperplane was computed based on the multivariate pattern for 10 different iterations of a training cohort of a sub-set of participants and another excluded subset (test set). Regional activation patterns which could robustly predict autistic traits, pattern maps were corrected for multiple comparisons and a Pearson correlation analysis used to measure the correlation between actual and predicted ASQ scores and those predicted by the MVPA. \n  \n\nAn event-related design implicit emotional face recognition task was implemented during fMRI scanning. Fifty grayscale facial stimuli displaying angry, fear, happy, neural or sad expressions (  n  \u2009=\u200910 per category, 50% male, each from different identities) were presented twice in two runs with a different pseudorandom sequence for all participants for discrimination of sex (see Fig.   for paradigm and  ). About forty minutes after fMRI scanning participants completed a surprise explicit face recognition memory test to establish if they remembered the facial stimuli presented during fMRI. This was used to assess possible associations between autistic trait scores on the ASQ and accuracy and corresponding response times (RT), but was not used in the analysis of the previous fMRI responses (see   and Fig.  ). \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nMRI data were acquired on a 3T GE MR750 system (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, USA). High-resolution whole-brain T1-weighted structural MRI data were acquired to improve normalization of the functional images. Task-based fMRI data were acquired during the implicit face recognition task (lasted around 12\u2009min, two sessions were implemented, each session consisted of 173 volumes). Functional MRI data were preprocessed using SPM12 (Statistical Parametric Mapping;  ) (see   for details). \n\n\n### Analytic approach for behavioral data \n  \nDuring the fMRI implicit emotion recognition task, discrimination accuracy for the sex of faces and RT were calculated. For the post-fMRI test, recognition accuracy and RT for both the surprise face memory test and explicit emotion recognition task, as well as ratings of arousal and intensity were calculated. All RTs were calculated only for trials where accurate identification of face sex or emotion was shown. Repeated measures ANOVAs with emotion expression (angry, fear, sad, neutral, and happy) as the within-subject factor were conducted to explore the main effect of emotion expression on behavioral indices. To further investigate if autistic traits were associated with behavioral indices, correlational analyses (Pearson) were conducted. \n\n\n### Analytic approach for MRI data \n  \n#### General linear model (GLM) analyses \n  \nFirst-level general linear models (GLMs) for the task-based fMRI data included condition-specific regressors of the 5 emotions (angry, fear, happy, neutral, and sad) were modelled to generate main contrasts of interest (angry > neutral, fear > neutral, happy > neutral, sad > neutral) and the six movement parameters were included as nuisance regressors. \n\n\n#### Pattern-based MVPA analyses and thresholding \n  \nTo determine if local activation patterns were predictive of autistic traits (ASQ scores), a whole-brain (restricted to a grey matter mask) searchlight-based multivariate machine-learning pattern analysis was implemented (see Fig.   for illustration). Specifically, we employed a support vector regression (SVR) algorithm implemented in the Spider toolbox ( ) (linear kernel,   C  \u2009=\u20091) with three-voxel radius spherical searchlights around center voxels employed for each contrast separately, with individual beta maps as features to predict participants\u2019 ASQ scores. The accuracy with which the significant neural activation patterns in response to different face emotions identified by the MVPA could be predictive of actual ASQ scores was determined by a Pearson correlation analysis between the actual ASQ scores and those predicted by the MVPA. The prediction performance was evaluated by a tenfold cross-validation procedure during which all participants were randomly assigned to 10 subsamples of 22 or 23 participants using MATLAB\u2019s cvpartition function. The optimal hyperplane was computed based on the multivariate pattern of the labeled 206 or 207 participants (training set) and then evaluated using the excluded 22 or 23 participants (test set). This procedure was repeated 10 times with each subsample being the testing set once. To identify regional activation patterns which could robustly predict autistic traits, pattern maps were corrected for multiple comparisons, within a grey matter mask based on false discovery rate (FDR) and additionally taking into account multiple comparisons involving the different face emotions (i.e. 4 contrasts) resulting in a corrected threshold at a whole-brain voxel level of   q  \u2009=\u20090.0125 FDR corrected (two-sided). \n\n\n#### Functional connectivity (FC) analyses and thresholding \n  \nTo further explore associations between autistic traits and FC in face-emotion processing networks, and modulatory effects of OXTR genotype, seed-to-whole-brain FC analyses with the contrasts exhibiting significant results from the MVPA analyses were computed using generalized psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) [ ]. Seeds (6-mm spheres) were placed at peak coordinates of significant clusters from the MVPA analyses. FC analysis firstly employed a whole brain approach with a significance threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 peak-level family-wise error (FWE) correction and a minimum voxel size of   k  \u2009>\u200910. To take into account the three different face emotions for which the MVPA showed significant effects Bonferroni corrections (\u00d73) were additionally applied. Brain regions were identified using the Automated Anatomic Labelling atlas 3 (AAL3) [ ] as implemented in the WFU Pick Atlas (School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina). \n\n\n#### Influence of OXTR genotype \n  \nSeed-region-specific connectivity maps were entered into two-sample t-test models, with genotype group (i.e., rs2254298- A+ vs. A- carriers), ASQ score as well as their interaction terms as covariates. When significant genotype \u00d7 ASQ interactions were found, parameter estimates from the significant clusters were extracted to visualize the interaction effects. Bonferroni corrections were applied for the number of SNPs and alleles (i.e. 4 \u00d7 2\u2009=\u20098). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Sample and genotyping \n  \nA total of 229 right-handed neurotypical Han Chinese participants (male = 114; mean age \u00b1 SD\u2009=\u200921.58\u2009\u00b1\u20092.343) were included in the final analysis (see Fig.   for exclusion flowchart). Distribution of the 4 OXTR (rs2254298, rs2268491, rs2268498, and rs53576) genotypes were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and alleles of the SNPs were divided into two groups as in previous studies [ ,  ] to increase statistical power and avoid statistical inference errors (see Table  ). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD total scores on the ASQ were 21.44\u2009\u00b1\u20095.60 (range 9\u201335). These ASQ scores are in good agreement with our previous large-scale (  n  \u2009=\u2009280) study on Chinese adult neurotypical individuals and there were also no significant differences in ASQ scores between males (21.56\u2009\u00b1\u20095.42, range 10\u201335) and females (21.32\u2009\u00b1\u20095.80, range 9-35) [ ] (  t  -test   p  \u2009=\u20090.747). \n\n\n### Behavioral results \n  \nTwo participants were additionally excluded due to incomplete data for the implicit emotion recognition task, leading to 227 participants (male = 112; mean age   SD\u2009=\u200921.57   2.351 years) included for behavioral data analyses. ANOVA results for the implicit emotion recognition task showed a main effect of face emotion for both accuracy (F \u2009=\u200921.257,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.086) and RTs (F \u2009=\u200924.747,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.099). Post-hoc Bonferroni corrected tests revealed that participants were less accurate for discriminating the sex of individuals with negative emotional expressions (angry, fear, and sad) compared to neutral and happy faces (all   p  s\u2009<\u20090.049) (Fig.  ). The RTs for all face emotions (angry, fear, sad and happy) were significantly longer than for neutral expressions (all   p  s\u2009<\u20090.002) (Fig.  ). Overall these results suggest that participants attentively processed the facial stimuli (i.e. discriminated the sex of individual faces accurately) and that presentation of negative emotional faces resulted in a lower accuracy and longer RTs.

Post-hoc Bonferroni-corrected comparisons showed participants remembered fearful, sad, and happy emotional faces better than neutral and angry ones, and fearful faces better than happy ones (see Supplementary Fig.  ). There was no main effect of emotion for RTs (F \u2009=\u20091.206,   p  \u2009=\u20090.305,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.005). \n\nFor emotion discrimination accuracy, an ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of emotion expression (F \u2009=\u2009105.298,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.318). Post-hoc Bonferroni-corrected comparison showed participants exhibited the highest discrimination accuracy for happy faces and the lowest for fearful faces. For RTs there was also a main effect of emotion expression (F \u2009=\u2009140.011,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.383) with the shortest RTs for neutral expression faces and the longest for fearful ones. For arousal and intensity ratings, ANOVAs revealed significant main effects of emotion expression (Arousal: F \u2009=\u2009258.318,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.533; Intensity: F \u2009=\u2009319.985,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   \u03b7  \u2009=\u20090.586) with post-hoc comparisons showing participants rated angry faces as the most arousing and intense with neutral ones as the least. Arousal ratings for sad faces were significantly lower compared with both fearful and happy ones. (see Supplementary Fig.  ). \n\nHowever, no significant associations were found between explicit face emotion recognition accuracy or RTs or recognition memory for faces or arousal or intensity ratings and ASQ scores (see  ). \n\n\n### Findings from MVPA analyses \n  \nThe SVR-based MVPA analysis revealed activity patterns of the right midbrain (extending into limbic areas) comprising the ventral tegmental area (VTA), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hypothalamus (MNIxyz = 3/\u22123/\u221218,   k  \u2009=\u200940), the left anterior orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (MNIxyz\u2009=\u2009\u221239/57/\u22129,   k  \u2009=\u200911), left caudate (MNIxyz\u2009=\u2009\u22123/\u22126/0,   k  \u2009=\u200920), right dorsal medial frontal cortex (dmPFC; MNIxyz = 3/42/42, k\u2009=\u200912), left postcentral gyrus (PoCG; MNIxyz\u2009=\u2009\u221245/\u221233/51,   k  \u2009=\u200945), and the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG; MNIxyz\u2009=\u2009\u221221/63/0,   k  \u2009=\u20096) could accurately predict individual autistic traits during processing of angry (versus neutral) expressions (Fig.  ). Additionally, during processing fear (versus neutral) expressions, individual autistic trait scores could be decoded from activity in the left MFG (MNI \u2009=\u2009\u221236/18/42,   k  \u2009=\u20098) (Fig.  ). Individual autistic-trait scores could also be decoded from neural activity towards sad (versus neutral) expressions in the left MFG (MNI \u2009=\u2009\u221236/24/33,   k  \u2009=\u20097), the right midbrain (MNI \u2009=\u2009\u22123/\u221230/\u22129,   k  \u2009=\u200913), and left hypothalamus (MNI \u2009=\u2009\u22123/\u22123/\u221215,   k  \u2009=\u200930) (Fig.  ).

However, there were significant interaction effects of ASQ and genotype for rs2268491 and rs2254298 on FC during processing of angry expressions. \n\nExamination of rs2268491 genotype (T+/T\u2212) \u00d7 ASQ score interactions revealed effects for the angry > neutral contrast in coupling of left OFC (seed,   x  \u2009=\u2009\u221239,   y  \u2009=\u200957,   z  \u2009=\u2009\u22129) with bilateral MCC (MNIxyz = 0/\u22129/45,   k  \u2009=\u200924, T\u2009=\u20095.11,   p  \u2009=\u20090.005;   pcorrected for number of significant face expressions  \u2009=\u20090.015) (Table  ). Parameter estimates from the significant clusters extracted to visualize interaction effects found opposite effects of ASQ scores on FC strengths in the T+ and T- groups. Pearson tests (  p   values Bonferonni corrected for the number of SNPs and alleles i.e. 4 \u00d7 2\u2009=\u20098) revealed a positive association between ASQ and the FC strength in the T- group and a negative association in the T+ group (T-:   r  \u2009=\u20090.318,   pcorrected  \u2009=\u20090.004; T+:   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.321,   pcorrected  \u2009=\u20090.005) (Fig.  ). Additionally, ASQ and rs2268491 interactively impacted FC strengths between the right midbrain (seed, x\u2009=\u20093, y\u2009=\u2009\u22123, z\u2009=\u2009\u221218) and right supramarginal gyrus (SMG) (MNIxyz = 63/\u221239/30,   k  \u2009=\u200914,   T  \u2009=\u20094.92,   p  \u2009=\u20090.012,   pcorrected for number of significant face expressions  \u2009=\u2009  0.036)   (Table  ). Parameter estimates were subsequently extracted and showed a positive association between ASQ and the FC strength in the T\u2212 group but negative association in the T+ group (T\u2212:   r  \u2009=\u20090.263,   pcorrected   for number of SNPs and alleles = 0.035; T+:   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.356,   pcorrected  \u2009=\u20090.011) (Fig.  ).   \nFC modulated by OXTR genotype during processing of angry > neutral face emotion. \n  \nStatistical significance thresholding was applied with whole-brain peak level at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 and a minimum voxel size of   k  \u2009>\u200910.

Parameter estimates were extracted and further revealed opposite effects of ASQ on these two couplings in A+ and A- carriers. ASQ was positively associated with the left OFC - left MCC coupling in A- carriers while A+ carriers exhibited a negative correlation (A-:   r  \u2009=\u20090.329,   pcorrected   for number of SNPs and alleles = 0.003; A+:   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.311,   pcorrected  \u2009=\u20090.006) (Fig.  ). Likewise, for A- carriers there was a positive correlation between autistic trait scores and left OFC - right MCC coupling but a negative correlation was in A+ carriers (A-:   r  \u2009=\u20090.399,   pcorrected  \u2009<\u20090.001; A+:   r  \u2009=\u2009\u22120.247,   pcorrected  \u2009=\u20090.032 one-tailed) (Fig.  ). \n\nNo significant interaction effects were observed for other seeds nor during processing fear or sad expressions. The analyses for SNPs rs53576 and rs2268498 did not yield any significant effects. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current study aimed to identify the neural pattern predictive of autistic traits during processing of different emotional faces and potential modulatory effects of OXTR genotype. There were no associations between trait autism and either implicit or explicit face emotion recognition accuracy. However, the SVR-based MVPA identified activity patterns that strikingly predicted individual autistic traits during processing of angry emotional expressions in regions involved in emotion, reward and salience, but not in early visual, processing. As such, they indicate that higher autistic traits tend to impact the \u2018extended\u2019 rather than the \u2018core\u2019 face emotion processing system. A seed-based FC analyses revealed that two OXTR SNPs (rs2254298, rs2268491) showed a modulatory effect on OFC-MCC coupling during processing of angry faces. Overall, these findings indicate that trait autism is predicted from extensive altered patterns of neural activity and reduced responses during processing of angry expressions in motivation, reward and salience processing networks. The association between FC of the OFC and MCC and angry faces is also OXTR genotype-dependent. \n\nAlthough we found overall evidence for negative emotional expressions influencing recognition accuracy of sex and emotion expression as well as arousal and intensity ratings, there was no evidence for associations between implicit or explicit face emotion recognition performance and ASQ scores. This is in line with a number of studies comparing autistic and neurotypical individuals [ \u2013 ], although other studies have either reported general impairment across face expressions or for negative or positive emotions in ASD [ ,  ]. Overall, the absence of any significant association between face emotion recognition and trait autism may reflect our use of a dimensional approach, but it should also be noted that discrimination accuracies were very high (>90% except for fear), and associations with trait autism might have been revealed with an increased task difficulty (see [ ]). Another possibility is that autistic traits have less of an effect on discrimination/decoding of emotional faces and more on subsequent cognitive and emotional processing. The absence of any associations between trait autism and responses to emotional faces in early visual processing regions may support this interpretation. \n\nThe SVR-based MVPA revealed whole-brain neural representative relevant for autistic traits across all negative face emotion expressions, although particularly for anger. Trait autism scores were predicted by patterns across a wide network of cortical and subcortical regions engaged in the \u2018extended\u2019 face emotion network including those involved in emotion, motivation, reward and salience processing. Predictive patterns were mainly found in limbic regions (hypothalamus), the social salience system (ACC) and most notably fronto-basal ganglia-midbrain reward systems (dmPFC, SFG, MFG, OFC, caudate and VTA). The MVPA thus revealed evidence for their spatial patterns of activity being predictive of dimensional autistic traits. Notably, the MVPA was not predictive of trait autism in the \u201ccore\u201d occipital and temporal cortex face emotion processing systems. This supports the conclusion that later cognitive rather than early visual processing of angry faces is sensitive to autistic traits. \n\nDiminished patterns of activation and responses to angry faces associated with higher autistic traits in limbic regions may indicate reduced processing of threatening emotional stimuli [ ,  ]. However, our MVPA analysis only revealed hypothalamic rather than amygdala spatial patterns predicted autistic traits. The hypothalamus, is involved in emotion processing [ \u2013 ], can function as a valence detector and modulator [ ,  ] and is highly connected with the hippocampus and amygdala [ \u2013 ]. Hypothalamic morpho-functional differences have also been reported in ASD [ ]. \n\nThe ACC in the brain salience network was also predictive of trait autism during the processing of angry faces suggesting that higher autistic trait individuals perceive threatening stimuli as less salient. The ACC plays a central role in processing subjective evaluation and emotional salience-associated with cognitive processing, executive control and self-awareness [ \u2013 ] and shows altered structure and function in ASD [ \u2013 ]. Two recent electroencephalography studies have also reported differences in cingulate and other cortical responses to angry faces in individuals with ASD both in terms of patterns of synchronization associated with symptom severity [ ,  ] and evoked potentials in cingulate and other cortical regions, potentially indicating impaired salience processing. \n\nThe ability of patterns of activation in fronto-basal ganglia circuitry to predict autistic trait scores is in line with the \u201cDopamine Theory of ASD\u201d [ ,  ]. According to this theory, the dysfunctional midbrain dopaminergic system which projects to the prefrontal cortex and striatum via both mesocorticolimbic (MCL) and nigrostriatal (NS) circuits leads to impaired reward processing and motivation-related behavior along with altered goal-directed motor behavior and habitual behavior, contributing to core behavioral features of ASD. Although fronto-basal ganglia circuitry plays an important role in reward and motivation, it also transmits signals related to salient, but non-rewarding, experiences such as aversive and alerting events and thus additionally plays a crucial role in motivational control of either approach or avoidance behavior [ ]. Individuals with ASD tend to have greater problems in recognizing angry expression faces rather than other emotions independent of alexythmia [ ] and children with ASD exhibit an attentional bias away from angry faces at long presentation rates with greater avoidance being associated with greater social communication difficulties [ ]. Thus, in ASD, the basic pre-dispositional mechanisms to allocate attention quickly towards angry faces may be weaker [ ]. However, given that we only found patterns of activation in response to angry faces were predictive of autistic trait scores in the \u2018extended\u2019 rather than the \u2018core\u2019 face processing network this would tend to support the argument that greater autistic symptoms may primarily lead to altered interpretation and responses to angry faces rather than simply to reduced attention towards them. Indeed, in our behavioral analyses accuracy and response times for identifying the sex of face emotions did not reveal any problems specific to angry emotion faces, again suggesting that participants did pay attention to them. Thus, avoidance of angry faces in ASD may have more to do with post-attentive cognitive and motivational processing. \n\nOur initial hypothesis that OXTR genotype would influence associations between functional connectivity in neural circuitry identified by the MVPA as predictive of autistic traits was supported, in line with previous findings [ ]. The intrinsic FC of OFC-MCC and midbrain-SMG was dependent upon both autistic traits and OXTR genotype (either rs2254298 or rs2268491) for responses to angry faces. Carriers of the risk alleles of the SNPs (A+ or T+) associated with social cognition dysfunction and ASD [ ,  ,  ] showed reduced FC in individuals with higher autistic trait scores but increased connectivity in those carrying the non-risk allele (A- or T-). The neural coupling of OFC to MCC may be involved in reward and motivation processing given that the MCC is known to play a critical role in both reward [ ,  \u2013 ] and emotion [ ,  ] processing. Connectivity between midbrain and SMG may also play an important role in emotion processing [ ], especially for the negative emotions [ ,  ]. Both SMG and MCC are critical for social functioning in the context of ASD such as empathic processing [ ,  ,  ] and self-other distinction [ ,  ] and may contribute to representation and integration of internal and emotional feeling states. A previous study has also reported a genotype \u00d7 autism symptom interaction for SMG responses during face emotion recognition for rs2254298, rs2268491and rs53576 OXTR SNPs [ ]. The OXTR SNPs rs2268491and rs2254298 exhibit high linkage disequilibrium (LD) [ ,  ] which may explain their common modulatory effects. \n\nThere are some limitations to be noted. Firstly, the study adopted a dimensional approach using only neurotypical individuals and measurement of trait autism using the ASQ and findings should be confirmed in a clinical ASD population. Secondly, due to current limitations of the MVPA model used, we were unable to investigate whether autistic trait scores and OXTR genotype interactions could predict neural patterns in response to emotional faces. Thirdly, for the functional connectivity analysis we only investigated effects of four OXTR SNPs and other OXTR SNPs might have revealed additional influences on functional connectivity. Lastly, although we hypothesized the potential relevance of our findings to the \u201cdopamine theory\u201d or reduced reward processing in ASD we did not specifically quantify changes in dopamine or dopamine receptors in reward processing regions. \n\nIn conclusion, we used a validated implicit emotional face recognition task and dimensional approach in a large cohort of neurotypical individuals to demonstrate extensive evidence for patterns of neural responses to angry (threatening) faces in individuals which could predict autistic trait scores across \u201cextended\u201d face emotion processing networks involved in emotion, motivation and reward and salience but not in \u2018core\u2019 early visual processing ones. Functional connectivity changes in the identified reward (OFC - MCC) and emotion (midbrain - SMG) processing networks during angry face processing were dependent upon OXTR genotype. One of the overall implications of these findings may be that individuals with ASD process threatening face expressions, such as anger, differently and potentially in a way that could lead to inappropriate responses. Given that even neurotypical individuals show altered patterns of neural responses to threatening emotional faces in cognitive and emotion processing regions which predict their level of autistic traits this may provide a potential neural diagnostic biomarker for ASD. However, this needs to be established in future studies investigating patterns of neural processing of emotional stimuli in individuals diagnosed with ASD and it may also be important to consider the modulating influence of OXTR genotype. \n\n\n\n### Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nRegion\tk\tt-value\tpFWE-0.05\tpcorrected\tx\ty\tz\nrs2254298\trs2254298\trs2254298\trs2254298\trs2254298\trs2254298\trs2254298\trs2254298\nseed: OFC (\u221239/57/\u22129)\tseed: OFC (\u221239/57/\u22129)\tseed: OFC (\u221239/57/\u22129)\tseed: OFC (\u221239/57/\u22129)\tseed: OFC (\u221239/57/\u22129)\tseed: OFC (\u221239/57/\u22129)\tseed: OFC (\u221239/57/\u22129)\tseed: OFC (\u221239/57/\u22129)\nMCC, R\t14\t5.10\t0.006\t0.018\t15\t\u221221\t42\nMCC, L/ MCC, R\t23\t5.05\t0.007\t0.021\t0\t\u22129\t45\nrs2268491\trs2268491\trs2268491\trs2268491\trs2268491\trs2268491\trs2268491\trs2268491\nseed: OFC (-39/57/-9)\tseed: OFC (-39/57/-9)\tseed: OFC (-39/57/-9)\tseed: OFC (-39/57/-9)\tseed: OFC (-39/57/-9)\tseed: OFC (-39/57/-9)\tseed: OFC (-39/57/-9)\tseed: OFC (-39/57/-9)\nMCC, L/ MCC, R\t24\t5.11\t0.005\t0.015\t0\t\u22129\t45\nseed: Midbrain (3/\u22123/\u221218)\tseed: Midbrain (3/\u22123/\u221218)\tseed: Midbrain (3/\u22123/\u221218)\tseed: Midbrain (3/\u22123/\u221218)\tseed: Midbrain (3/\u22123/\u221218)\tseed: Midbrain (3/\u22123/\u221218)\tseed: Midbrain (3/\u22123/\u221218)\tseed: Midbrain (3/\u22123/\u221218)\nSMG, R\t14\t4.92\t0.012\t0.036\t63\t\u221239\t30\n### Caption\nFC modulated by OXTR genotype during processing of angry > neutral face emotion.\n### Footer\nStatistical significance thresholding was applied with whole-brain peak level at pFWE\u2009<\u20090.05 and a minimum voxel size of k\u2009>\u200910.

However, it remains controversial whether one or two nights of recovery sleep following sleep deprivation fully restores brain and cognitive function. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and examined the effects of two consecutive nights (20-hour time-in-bed) of recovery sleep on resting-state hippocampal connectivity and episodic memory deficits following one night of total sleep deprivation (TSD) in 39 healthy adults in a controlled in-laboratory protocol. TSD significantly reduced memory performance in a scene recognition task, impaired hippocampal connectivity to multiple prefrontal and default mode network regions, and disrupted the relationships between memory performance and hippocampal connectivity. Following TSD, two nights of recovery sleep restored hippocampal connectivity to baseline levels, but did not fully restore memory performance nor its associations with hippocampal connectivity. These findings suggest that more than two nights of recovery sleep are needed to fully restore memory function and hippocampal-memory associations after one night of total sleep loss. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nInsufficient sleep is a widespread problem in contemporary societies. Millions of people sleep less than 7\u2009hours per night, which is the minimum sleep duration to prevent cumulative deterioration in neurobehavioral performance . Sleep loss destabilizes the wake state, impairs cognition and behavior, increases the risk for multiple diseases, and incurs considerable social, financial, and health-related costs . \n\nAlthough the exact function of sleep remains to be elucidated, it is well known that sleep facilitates memory retention , whereas sleep deprivation degrades memory performance and brain function . Animal studies have consistently demonstrated the impairing effects of sleep loss on several neural circuits involved in learning and memory, in particular the hippocampal complex . Accumulating evidence also suggests that newly encoded information temporarily stored in the hippocampus is reactivated during sleep and integrated with existing long-term memories stored in the neocortex . In humans, sleep deprivation attenuates hippocampal function at rest as well as during memory encoding, consolidation, and recognition tasks . A growing body of research suggests that functional connectivity between the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and default mode network (DMN) regions may play critical roles in memory function , which are disrupted by sleep deprivation . \n\nAlthough the detrimental effects of sleep loss on memory and brain function are well established, whether and how recovery sleep restores memory and brain function after sleep loss are not well understood. To date, only a limited number of studies have examined the restoring effects of recovery sleep on cognitive and brain function. For example, an animal study suggested that several hours of recovery sleep restored hippocampal synaptic plasticity and connectivity in mice after brief sleep deprivation . In humans, some studies have indicated that one or two nights of recovery sleep might be able to restore cognitive performance and brain adenosinergic system to baseline levels , while others have suggested that neurobehavioral deficits, self-monitoring abilities, and brain metabolic decreases after total or chronic sleep loss might not be fully recovered by one or two nights of recovery sleep . A recent study found that a 90-min recovery nap restored hippocampus-dependent learning during the day of sleep deprivation, and the structural morphology of hippocampal subfields predicted the success of learning restoration . However, it remains unclear about how much amount of recovery sleep people would need to fully restore both cognitive and brain function following sleep deprivation. \n\nThe present study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and aimed to examine both the impairing effects of one night of total sleep deprivation (TSD) and the restorative effects of two consecutive nights (12-hours and 8-hours time-in-bed) of recovery sleep following TSD on episodic memory and hippocampal functional connectivity in a well-controlled 5-day and 4-night in-laboratory study (see Fig.\u00a0 ). We also studied an additional cohort of control participants using the same protocol but without sleep loss to exclude the potential confounding effects of in-laboratory experimental procedures on brain connectivity and memory performance. While a number of literature has demonstrated the alteration of brain connectivity in different resting-state networks after sleep deprivation , we focused on the effects of recovery sleep following sleep deprivation on hippocampal functional connectivity and episodic memory performance in this study. Based on previous literature, we hypothesized that one night of acute TSD would significantly disrupt episodic memory performance (H1a) and the underlying hippocampal connectivity (H1b) as compared to baseline levels, whereas two nights of recovery sleep after one night of acute TSD would restore both episodic memory performance (H2a) and hippocampal connectivity (H2b) to baseline levels.   \nThe 5-day and 4-night experimental protocols for (  a  ) the total sleep deprivation (TSD) group, and (  b  ) the non-sleep-deprived control group. Participants arrived at the laboratory in the afternoon of Day 1 and were provided 9\u201310\u2009h time-in-bed (TIB) for baseline sleep (BS) on Night 1. After the first scanning session (fMRI scan 1) in the morning of Day 2, participants were randomized to either a TSD or a control condition. On Night 2, the TSD group was kept awake while the control group was allowed 8\u2009h TIB control sleep. After the second scanning session (fMRI scan 2) in the morning of Day 3, the TSD group was then allowed 12\u2009h TIB and 8\u2009h TIB recovery sleep (RS) on Night 3 and Night 4 respectively, while the control group was allowed 8\u2009h TIB control sleep on both nights. The third scanning session (fMRI scan 3) took place in the morning of Day 5. The scanning time for the three scanning sessions was kept constant from 0700\u2009h to 1000\u2009h, and each participant was scanned at the same time across the three scanning sessions to avoid the potential time-of-day differences (scan duration for each participant was about an hour). Participants completed the Memory Test in each afternoon during the protocol. \n  \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe first compared behavioral performance on the episodic memory task before and after TSD to determine the effects of one night of acute TSD on memory function. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 , memory performance was significantly impaired after TSD (day 3) when compared to baseline (day 2), including significantly decreased hit rate (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05), increased false alarm (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01), and reduced d-prime (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001), while no differences were found in the memory performance between the corresponding day 2 and day 3 in the control subjects (all   p  \u2009>\u20090.05). These findings support our hypothesis (H1a) that one night of acute TSD would disrupt episodic memory function. We then compared memory performance at baseline (day 2) and after recovery sleep (day 5) to examine whether two nights of recovery sleep could fully restore episodic memory function. Contradicting with our initial hypothesis H2a, memory performance was still significantly impaired in hit rate (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05), false alarm (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05), and d-prime (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001), suggesting that participants may need more than two nights of recovery sleep to restore memory function after one night of sleep loss.   \nAveraged episodic memory performance (hit rate, false alarm, and discrimination scores (d\u2019)) (\u00b1SEM) across the four consecutive days for the total sleep deprivation (TSD) group and the control group. Significant differences were found in hit rate, false alarm, and d\u2019 across the four consecutive days (baseline sleep (D2), TSD (D3), recovery sleep (D4), recovery sleep (D5)) in the TSD group. All three indexes of memory performances diminished significantly after TSD compared to baseline sleep (D2) (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). However, task performances did not return to baseline levels (D2) after two consecutive nights of recovery sleep (D4 & D5) relative to TSD (D3) (  p  \u2009>\u20090.05). The differences in task performances between baseline sleep (D2) and first night of recovery sleep (D4; except hit rate) as well as second night of recovery sleep (D5) were both significant (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05). In the control group, no differences in task performances were found among corresponding days (  p  \u2009>\u20090.05). The baseline levels (D2) of all three indexes did not differ between groups (  p  \u2009>\u20090.05). *  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, **  p  \u2009<\u20090.01, ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001. \n  \n\nFor brain imaging data, we compared resting-state functional connectivity patterns before and after TSD to determine the effects of one night of acute TSD on hippocampal connectivity. As shown in Fig.\u00a0  and listed in Table\u00a0 , hippocampal connectivity was significantly reduced in multiple DMN and prefrontal regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial superior frontal gyrus (mSFG), right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (R.vmPFC), and right precentral gyrus (R.PreCG), and was significantly increased in bilateral cerebellum and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R.dlPFC) after one night of TSD when compared to baseline condition. All of these brain regions survived whole brain family-wise error rate (FWE) corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.01. These regions were defined as the regions of interest (ROIs) for further analyses to determine the restoration effects of two nights of recovery sleep on hippocampal connectivity. In contrast, no brain connectivity differences were found in the control group (see Fig.\u00a0 ). These findings support our hypothesis (H1b) that one night of acute TSD would significantly disrupt hippocampal connectivity.   \nFunctional connectivity analysis for both the total sleep deprivation (TSD) group and the control group, using bilateral hippocampus as the seed. (  a  ) The contrast of TSD vs. BS showed significantly decreased connectivity between bilateral hippocampus and bilateral medial superior frontal gyrus (mSFG), posterior cingulated cortex (PCC), right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (R.vmPFC), as well as right precentral gyrus (R.PreCG), whereas increased connectivity between bilateral hippocampus and right dorsolateral frontal cortex (R.dlPFC) as well as bilateral cerebellum following TSD compared to following BS. Images were displayed at a threshold of uncorrected p\u2009<\u20090.001 with cluster size larger than 30 voxels. (  b  ) In the control group, the contrast of D3 vs. D2 did not show any significant connectivity differences.

All clusters survived whole brain FWE corrected p\u2009<\u20090.05. R. right, L. left. \n  \n\nThe results from the ROI analyses are shown in Fig.\u00a0 . When comparing hippocampal connectivity at baseline (day 2) and after recovery sleep (day 5), no differences were observed in the TSD group (all   p  \u2009>\u20090.05). These findings support our hypothesis (H2b) and suggest that two nights of recovery sleep would restore hippocampal connectivity to baseline levels after one night of sleep loss. Moreover, the ROI analyses also demonstrated that the increased connectivity in the R.dlPFC from the whole-brain analysis was due to reduced negative connectivity (anti-correlations) between the hippocampus and this region (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001), and the increased connectivity in the cerebellum was due to reversed connectivity (from negative to positive correlations) to the hippocampus during TSD (day 3) as compared to baseline (day 2). No connectivity differences were found among any scans from the three corresponding days in the control subjects (all   p  \u2009>\u20090.05).   \nRegion of interest (ROI) analysis for the total sleep deprivation (TSD) group and the control group. Functional connectivity between bilateral hippocampus and bilateral medial superior frontal gyrus (mSFG), posterior cingulated cortex (PCC), right precentral gyrus (R.PreCG), right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (R.vmPFC) decreased significantly after TSD (D3) relative to baseline sleep (D2) (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001), and increased significantly after recovery sleep (D5) relative to TSD (D3) (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001). The anti-correlation between bilateral hippocampus and bilateral cerebellum as well as right dorsolateral frontal cortex (R.dlPFC) reduced significantly after TSD (D3) relative to baseline sleep (D2) (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001), and returned back to baseline level (D2) after two nights of recovery sleep (D5) relative to TSD (D3) (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001). The differences in hippocampus-ROIs connectivity between baseline sleep (D2) and recovery sleep (D5) were not significant (  p  \u2009>\u20090.05). In the control group, no differences in connectivity were found among corresponding days (  p  \u2009>\u20090.05). The baseline levels (D2) of hippocampus-ROIs (except bilateral cerebellum) connectivity did not differ between groups (  p  \u2009>\u20090.05). Error bars represent standard errors of the mean. *  p  \u2009<\u20090.05, **  p  \u2009<\u20090.01, ***  p  \u2009<\u20090.001. \n  \n\nWe also examined the relationships between hippocampal connectivity and episodic memory performance (d-prime) separately during each scan day (day 2, day 3, and day 5, see Fig.\u00a0 ) using correlation analyses and non-parametric permutation tests. A significant positive correlation was observed between resting-state hippocampal connectivity and memory performance (d-prime) in the R.vmPFC (Fig.\u00a0 , Pearson r\u2009=\u20090.419,   p  \u2009=\u20090.001; Spearman rho = 0.336,   p  \u2009=\u20090.036; permutation test   p  \u2009=\u20090.003). However, this correlation was disrupted during TSD (Fig.\u00a0 , Pearson r\u2009=\u20090.208,   p  \u2009=\u20090.20; Spearman rho = 0.144,   p  \u2009=\u20090.38; permutation test   p  \u2009=\u20090.11) and following recovery sleep (Fig.\u00a0 , Pearson r\u2009=\u20090.176,   p  \u2009=\u20090.28; Spearman rho = 0.126,   p  \u2009=\u20090.26; permutation test   p  \u2009=\u20090.13). Although the comparisons of correlation coefficients did not reach significant differences between conditions, these findings suggest that TSD impaired the associations between hippocampal connectivity and episodic memory performance and such impairments might not be fully restored after two nights of recovery sleep.   \nThe scatter plots showed the correlation between hippocampal connectivity and episodic memory performance (d\u2019) after baseline sleep (BS,   a  ), during total sleep deprivation (TSD,   b  ), and following recovery sleep (RS,   c  ). \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this study demonstrated for the first time both the detrimental and restoring changes in resting-state hippocampal connectivity and episodic memory after one night of acute total sleep deprivation and following two consecutive nights of recovery sleep. As expected, we found significantly impaired connectivity between hippocampus and multiple brain regions after TSD, which is in line with previous memory and sleep deprivation studies . However, we also found that two nights of recovery sleep following TSD did not restore episodic memory performance to baseline, even though hippocampal connectivity was restored to baseline levels. These findings only partly support our hypothesis concerning the restoring effects of recovery sleep but are nevertheless consistent with several previous studies showing insufficient restoration of cognitive performance and/or brain function after one or two nights of recovery sleep following sleep loss . In addition, the associations between hippocampal connectivity and episodic memory performance were also disrupted during TSD and did not fully restore after two nights of recovery sleep, suggesting that intact hippocampal functional connectivity may not be sufficient to support normal episodic memory function after two nights of recovery from sleep deprivation. \n\nNumerous previous studies have undoubtedly demonstrated the impacts of sleep loss on multiple neurobehavioral domains, particularly attention, learning, and memory . Impaired neurobehavioral performance includes slowed response times, concentration lapses, increased errors of commission and omission, and mitigated learning ability and memory consolidation. For example, using a picture recognition memory task, Yoo and colleagues  found that a single night of total sleep deprivation produced significant deficits in hippocampus-dependent episodic memory encoding and subsequent memory retention, while Sterpenich and colleagues  showed that one night of total sleep deprivation impaired recollection of positive and neutral pictures (but not negative pictures). Moreover, Van Der Werf and colleagues  reported that even a mild sleep disruption was sufficient to affect hippocampal-dependent memory encoding and performance. Using a free recall test of word lists, de Almeida and colleagues  reported that both episodic memory and short-term memory were significantly spared after two nights of sleep deprivation. In our study, we found that one night of TSD significantly reduced hit rate, increased false alarm, and reduced d-prime, which are consistent with previous studies and further support the key role of sleep in hippocampus-dependent episodic memory function. Memory performance did not show any significant changes across three scan days in the control protocol without sleep deprivation, suggesting that hindered memory performance was specific to sleep loss and not due to other aspects of the experimental protocol that the control participants also experienced. \n\nTSD altered functional connectivity between the hippocampus and multiple DMN and prefrontal regions, including the PCC, vmPFC, and mSFG. These findings replicate previous studies showing that TSD impaired hippocampal connectivity at rest and/or during memory tasks . Both the PCC and vmPFC are the core nodes of DMN, which is thought to be involved in autobiographical and episodic memory processing . Enhanced connectivity between the hippocampus and DMN has been linked to successful memory formation in normal individuals  while reduced connectivity has been observed in patients with episodic memory deficits . However, we did not find increased hippocampal connectivity to subcortical regions after TSD as reported in several previous studies . The discrepancy may be due to differences in the experimental design, study protocol, characteristics of participants, as well as data acquisition parameters and analysis pipelines. For example, the study by Yoo   et al  .  employed a between-subject design and compared hippocampal connectivity between a cohort of sleep-deprived subjects and another independent cohort of non-sleep-deprived controls during the performance of a memory encoding task. In contrast, both the current study and the study by Chengyang   et al  .  employed a within-subject design and compared resting-state hippocampal connectivity in the same cohort of healthy adults at rested wakefulness and after one night of sleep deprivation. The Chengyang   et al  . study  included two scans from 20 healthy young male adults (age range 18\u201324 years) while the current study included three scans from 70 male and female healthy adults with a much larger age range (21\u201350 years). In addition, all subjects in the current study were required to stay in the laboratory across 5 days and 4 nights and carefully monitored for their activities and food intake, while subjects in previous studies were monitored in the laboratory during the TSD period. However, it remains unknown how the laboratory environment and specific activities would affect hippocampal connectivity and memory function. \n\nWe also found that TSD significantly increased hippocampal connectivity to the right dlPFC, a key node of the task-positive dorsal attention network (DAN). However, ROI analyses indicated that such increased connectivity was actually due to reduced anti-correlation between the dlPFC and the hippocampus. Since the hippocampus is a core region of the DMN , this finding is consistent with the literature demonstrating reduced anti-correlations between the DMN and DAN after sleep loss . During rested wakefulness after normal sleep, the task-negative DMN is usually activated whereas the task-positive DAN is suppressed at rest in the absence of task requirements, suggesting a functional decoupling between these two networks . The reduction of anti-correlation during TSD suggests that task-negative and task-positive networks may fail to remain functionally distinct from each other after sleep loss, which may lead to an altered allocation of cognitive resources to brain networks and poor modulation of attention processes in response to shifting cognitive demands . \n\nOne night of TSD not only impaired resting-state hippocampal connectivity, but also disrupted the associations between hippocampal connectivity and episodic memory performance. Specifically, resting-state hippocampal connectivity to prefrontal regions (R.vmPFC) correlated with episodic memory performance following baseline sleep, but not during sleep deprivation or after recovery sleep. These findings are consistent with the view that hippocampus-prefrontal communications are important for optimal redistribution of temporal memory traces to more permanent cortical storage, and that disruptions of such communications may compromise the cognitive capacity for committing new experiences to memory . \n\nConsistent with our hypothesis, we found that disrupted hippocampal connectivity after TSD returned to baseline levels after two consecutive nights (20\u2009hours of time-in-bed) of recovery sleep. However, we did not observe full restoration of memory performance and its associations with hippocampal connectivity to baseline levels after two consecutive nights of recovery sleep. These findings on memory restoration failure appear to contradict several prior studies where it was suggested that one night of recovery sleep restored cognitive performance  to baseline levels. Specifically, a previous study reported that a 90-min recovery nap restored hippocampus-dependent learning ability and memory function in a mnemonic similarity task during the day of acute total sleep deprivation . However, the failure of memory restoration after two nights of recovery sleep is in line with many other previous studies where it was indicated that more than one night of recovery sleep was needed to fully restore cognitive performance  and brain metabolic changes  after total or chronic sleep loss. For example, Dinges and colleagues  reported that one night of recovery sleep was not sufficient to reverse cognitive deficits resulting from chronic sleep restriction. Similarly, Belenky and colleagues  showed that three nights of recovery sleep were not able to fully restore performance in the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) after seven nights of chronic sleep restriction. Pejovic and colleagues  showed that PVT performance deficits persisted after two nights of recovery sleep following six nights of chronic sleep restriction (6-h). Lo and colleagues  also reported that sustained attention performance did not return to baseline levels after two nights of recovery sleep following seven nights of chronic sleep restriction (5-h). Taken together, our findings provide further evidence supporting that two nights of recovery sleep are insufficient to fully restore cognitive and brain function from one night of TSD. \n\nThere are several limitations in our study. First, this study only involves overnight total sleep deprivation, thus we could not determine the specific contribution of different types of sleep, such as slow wave sleep (SWS) or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep to the detrimental effects of sleep loss on hippocampal connectivity and episodic memory. Moreover, we were not able to examine the sleep stage changes during the two night of recovery sleep. However, the dual-process hypothesis suggests that SWS is more important for declarative memory (including episodic memory and semantic memory) whereas REM sleep is essential for procedural memory . Increased functional coupling between the hippocampus and neocortical regions has been found in stage-2 sleep , while decreased coupling between the hippocampus and PCC has been found during SWS compared with the waking state . Furthermore, increases in hippocampal connectivity correlate with the amount of prior SWS . These findings suggest that different types of memories may occur during different sleep stages. Future studies should replicate the current findings and determine the potential different roles of stage-2 sleep, SWS, and REM sleep in maintaining and restoring brain network integrity and memory function. \n\nSecond, although both acute TSD and chronic sleep restriction can induce similar impairments in cognitive performance, some studies suggest that the recovery following acute TSD may be faster than that following chronic sleep restriction . Therefore, acute TSD and chronic sleep restriction might have somewhat different physiological processes . The present study focuses on the effects of acute TSD and their restoration, thus our findings cannot be generalized to the effects of chronic partial sleep restriction on brain function and its associations with memory performance. Future studies are needed to determine whether acute total sleep deprivation and chronic partial sleep restriction and their recovery would share the same or separable neural mechanisms, and whether neural recovery would occur across the same time period or over a different temporal duration following different forms and doses of sleep deprivation . \n\nThird, we only used fMRI to measure resting-state hippocampal connectivity and did not image memory task in the scanner at the same time. Previous task-related fMRI studies have reported significant effects of sleep deprivation and recovery sleep on memory performance and hippocampal function . However, because sleep deprivation simultaneously impairs brain function and memory performance, it is difficult for task-related fMRI studies to dissociate the effects of sleep loss on brain function   per se   from the effects of sleep loss on task performance that subsequently affects brain function. Moreover, the use of resting-state fMRI may eliminate confounds of differences in task performance, effort, practice, task strategy , and reduce the potential effects of fatigue on brain connectivity. Of note, sleep deprived participants may easily become fatigued when performing tasks, therefore, the use of resting-state fMRI outperforms the use of task-based fMRI with respect to sleep deprivation studies. Nonetheless, future studies may need to combine both resting-state and task-related fMRI to more comprehensively understand the impairing effects of sleep deprivation and the restoring effects of recovery sleep on brain function and memory performance. \n\nFinally, the final analyses only included 39 subjects with an age range between 21 and 50 years. Although this sample size is not small in the sleep deprivation literature, we were not able to find significant differences in the correlation coefficients between memory performance (d-prime) and the hippocampal connectivity across baseline, TSD, and recovery sleep conditions. Thus, our results of the disrupted relationships between memory performance and hippocampal connectivity after TSD and recovery sleep need to be regarded as preliminary and future studies with a larger sample size are needed to validate our findings. In addition, because memory degradation is highly prevalent in elderly individuals, future studies are necessary to examine how sleep loss and recovery sleep impact memory function in this vulnerable population. However, our findings may have important implications for understanding memory dysfunction in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. For example, hippocampal connectivity measured by resting-state fMRI may offer a noninvasive approach for monitoring the effects of sleep loss on the episodic memory system in the human brain. Disturbed hippocampal connectivity has been consistently observed in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD), for which episodic memory degradation is a hallmark symptom . Both animal and human studies have demonstrated that sleep loss exacerbates amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaque aggregation in the brain, a fundamental process leading to AD . Moreover, a very recent study suggests that quantitative and qualitative features of human sleep may represent non-invasive biomarkers of AD pathology . Since reduced sleep duration and increased sleep disturbances are concomitant symptoms of aging and AD , disruption in hippocampal connectivity and its associations with memory performance may provide a plausible mechanism for the deleterious effects of sleep loss in this population. \n\nIn summary, here we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a well controlled in-laboratory sleep deprivation protocol and demonstrated both the impairing effects of one night of acute total sleep deprivation and the restoring effects of two consecutive nights of recovery sleep on hippocampal connectivity and episodic memory performance. We found that sleep deprivation significantly impaired hippocampal connectivity to multiple prefrontal and default mode network regions, reduced episodic memory performance, and disrupted the associations between them. Although hippocampal connectivity was fully restored to baseline levels after two nights of recovery sleep, episodic memory performance and its associations with hippocampal connectivity did not return to baseline. These findings support the critical role of sleep in maintaining the integrity of hippocampal circuits and suggest that people may need more than two nights of recovery sleep to fully restore both memory performance and their associations with brain function after one night of total sleep loss. Optimization of sleep time may represent a potential effective intervention for the deleterious effects of sleep loss on memory and hippocampal function, with therapeutic opportunities for aging and AD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA total of 70 healthy adults (age range 21\u201350 years, 41 males) participated in a 5-day and 4-night in-laboratory controlled sleep deprivation experiment , including 54 adults in the experimental group with one night of TSD (Fig.\u00a0 ) and 16 adults in the control group without sleep loss (Fig.\u00a0 ). Fifteen participants in the TSD group and one participant in the control group were excluded due to head motion, MR hardware problem, falling asleep during the scans, and/or missing behavioral data. Thus, fifty-four participants (age range 21\u201350\u2009yrs, 28 males) were included in the present study, including 39 in the TSD group (mean age = 33.5\u2009\u00b1\u20098.8\u2009yrs, 22 males) and 15 in the control group (mean age = 34.5\u2009\u00b1\u20099.0\u2009yrs, 7 males). The sleep-wake schedule of each participant was assessed by at least one week actigraphy, sleep-wake diaries, sleep and circadian rhythm questionnaires, and a night of laboratory polysomnography and oximetry measurements during the weeks preceding the study. All participants had a regular sleep-wake schedule of nocturnal sleep duration between 6.5 and 8.5\u2009hours, regular bedtime between 2200\u20130000\u2009h and wake time of 0600\u20130900\u2009h, and no evidence of habitual napping or sleep disorders. Participants could not have participated in trans-meridian travel or shift work, nor had irregular sleep-wake routines for 60 days prior to the in-lab study. Caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, medications (except 4 subjects took oral contraceptives and one subject took Mirena for birth control) or other psychoactive substances were prohibited from the week prior to and during the in-laboratory study. All participants were right-handed, not current smokers, and had no history of chronic physical or mental illness, as established by interviews, questionnaires, physical examinations, and blood and urine tests. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania and was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent before enrollment and were compensated for participating in the study. \n\n\n### In-laboratory study protocol \n  \nThe in-laboratory study lasted 5 consecutive days and 4 nights (see Fig.\u00a0  for the study protocol). All participants stayed in a laboratory room of the Clinical Translational Research Center at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Participants arrived at the laboratory on the afternoon of day 1 and were provided 9\u201310\u2009hours time-in-bed (TIB) sleep opportunity for baseline sleep on night 1. The first fMRI scan session took place on the morning of day 2 (0700\u20131000\u2009hours). Participants were then randomized to either a TSD or a control condition. On night 2, participants in the SD group were kept awake and then underwent the second fMRI scan on the morning of day 3 (0700\u20131000\u2009hours). On nights 3 and 4, these participants received 12 and 8\u2009hours recovery sleep, respectively. We used two consecutive nights of recovery sleep because previous studies have suggested that neurobehavioral and brain activity deficits after sleep loss may not be fully recovered after one night of sleep . The third fMRI scan took place on the morning of day 5 (0700\u20131000\u2009hours). Participants in the control group (Fig.\u00a0 ) also had the same three fMRI scans on the mornings of days 2, 3, and 5, but they were provided 8\u2009hours TIB sleep on nights 2 to 4. Because previous studies have suggested that time-of-day may modulate brain activity and memory performance , the time of fMRI scans and cognitive tests were fixed for all subjects and kept constant across the whole protocol to minimize the potential confounding time-of-day effects. \n\nThroughout the 5-day protocol, participants were continuously behaviorally monitored by trained staff in a semi-isolated living area. They were provided meals at regular, pre-specified hours, as well as snacks within reasonable limits. When not testing during the study, they were permitted to engage in non-strenuous activities such as reading and watching television. They were not allowed to do any physically demanding tasks, work on laptops, or leave the study environment. \n\nDuring the afternoons (1400\u20131800 hours) of days 2 to 5, all participants completed a scene encoding and recognition task to measure episodic memory function after SD. For the episodic memory task, participants were asked to view 90 or 150 color pictures during the encoding session and told to remember them for later recognition testing. Each day participants learned a different set of picture stimuli consisting of scenes, landscapes, objects, and non-famous people, which were pseudo-randomly selected from the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS)  and online, The number of pictures was kept the same across different days. Pictures with extreme emotional valence were excluded. The pictures were matched in terms of overall visual complexity, brightness, contrast, and emotional valence. Each picture was displayed on the computer screen for 1\u2009second with 0.5\u2009second inter-stimulus interval. A few minutes after the encoding task, participants performed the recognition tests, in which they viewed 30 pictures from the encoding session mixed with 60 new pictures as foils. Participants were required to make a forced-choice response as to whether they remembered the picture from the encoding session (\u2018old\u2019) or believed they had not viewed the picture before (\u2018new\u2019). There were four types of responses: (i) old pictures correctly recognized as old (\u2018hits\u2019); (ii) new stimuli correctly recognized as new (\u2018correct rejections\u2019); (iii) old pictures incorrectly judged to be new (\u2018misses\u2019); and (iv) new pictures incorrectly judged to be old (\u2018false alarms\u2019). Task performance was calculated on the basis of hit rate [hits/(hits + misses)], false alarm (FA) rate [false alarms/(false alarms + correct rejections)], and signal detection accuracy d-prime (d\u2019). According to the signal detection theory, d-prime is calculated as the normalized distance between the probability distributions of signal and noise and noise alone . Greater d-prime indicates participants have better performance to discriminate target from nontarget therefore a better memory in the task. Differences in episodic memory performance across the four consecutive days (days 2\u20135) were analyzed using repeated measures one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA). \n\n\n### Imaging data acquisition and analysis \n  \nAll MRI scans were performed using a 3\u2009T Siemens Trio system (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). A multiband gradient-echo EPI sequence was used for resting-state BOLD fMRI data acquisition with the following parameters: TR\u2009=\u20092\u2009s, TE\u2009=\u200924\u2009ms, FOV\u2009=\u2009220 \u00d7 220\u2009mm, matrix = 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 36, slices thickness = 4\u2009mm, 36 interleaved slices without gap. A total of 210 images were acquired from about 7\u2009min scanning for each participant. Participants were instructed to remain still in the scanner, keep their eyes open and look at a cross fixation on the center of a screen. An eye-tracking camera was used to monitor participants\u2019 eyes to confirm that they did not fall asleep during the scan. After the functional scans, high-resolution (1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm ) T1-weighted anatomic images were obtained using a standard 3D MPRAGE sequence for structural reference. \n\nImage data processing and analyses were carried out with the Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM 12, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, UK) and the REST 2.0 toolbox ( ), implemented in Matlab 14 (Math Works, Natick, MA). The 3 translational/rotational motion parameters and the framewise displacement (FD) were calculated. To control for the effect of head motion, the threshold of head motion parameters were set as 2 for translational/rotational motion and 0.5 for mean FD. Data from subjects whose head motion parameters were over the threshold were discarded. After head motion correction, scrubbing, and co-registration, functional images were smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 4\u2009mm and then normalized to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Linear trends were also removed. All functional volumes were finally band pass filtered at 0.01\u20130.08\u2009Hz to reduce low-frequency drift and physiological high-frequency respiratory and cardiac noise. Nuisance covariates including six head motion parameters, global mean signal, white matter signal and CSF signal were regressed out before the seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis . \n\nThe hippocampal seed was defined as the bilateral hippocampus from an automated anatomical labeling region of interest library . The Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between the mean BOLD fMRI signal time series of the seed region and all other voxels within the brain were calculated, generating a correlation map for each participant. Fisher\u2019s r-to-z transformation {z\u2009=\u20090.5 Ln [(1\u2009  +  \u2009r)/(1 \u2212 r)]} was then applied on these correlation maps to improve the normality of the correlation coefficients. A whole-brain voxel-wise group-level paired t-test was performed on these z-transformed correlation maps to compare resting-state brain connectivity patterns before and after TSD and determine the effects of one night of acute TSD on hippocampal connectivity. The threshold was defined as whole brain family-wise error (FWE) corrected   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. The regions showing significant changes in connectivity to hippocampus were then defined as the regions of interest (ROIs) to determine the restoration effects of two nights of recovery sleep on hippocampal connectivity. Spearman and Pearson correlation analyses, as well as permutation tests were performed to examine the relationships between hippocampal connectivity and episodic memory performance (d-prime) separately during each scan day using SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 18.0, IBM, Chicago, IL). Specifically, we used a permutation testing procedure to test the significance of the Pearson correlation: (i) the observed Pearson correlation was computed between the hippocampus-R.vmPFC connectivity and the d-prime; (ii) the values of d-prime were permuted relative to the connectivity values; (iii) Pearson correlation was then re-computed after each permutation; (iv) (i) and (ii) were repeated 10,000 times to build a null distribution of Pearson correlations for comparison with the observed Pearson correlation. Moreover, we used a correlation comparison method suggested by Diedenhofen and Musch  to evaluate whether correlation coefficients between memory performance (d-prime) and the hippocampal connectivity were statistically different across baseline, TSD, and recovery sleep conditions. \n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nBrain Regions\tx, y, z\tp value (FWE corrected)\tCluster Size\tPeak T\nBS\u2009>\u2009TSD\tBS\u2009>\u2009TSD\tBS\u2009>\u2009TSD\tBS\u2009>\u2009TSD\tBS\u2009>\u2009TSD\nMedial Superior Frontal Gyrus\t3, 66, 15\t<0.001\t68\t5.39\nPosterior Cingulate Cortex\t0, \u221254, 36\t<0.001\t145\t4.83\nR.

The current study investigated the relationship between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, neural activity during a picture-encoding task, and subsequent memory recall. \n\n Methods:   A total of 70 patients with BD grouped according to genotype [ValVal or Met carriers (MetVal/MetMet)] underwent fMRI while performing a picture-encoding task. Memory for the encoded pictures was tested with a subsequent free recall memory task. \n\n Results:   There was no difference between the ValVal homozygotes and Met carriers in the involvement of hypothesized memory encoding regions i.e. hippocampus and dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC). However, an exploratory whole-brain analysis showed greater encoding-related lateral occipital cortex activity in Met carriers. Behaviorally, Met carriers also showed better free recall of the encoded pictures. \n\n Conclusions:   We found no effect of the BDNF genotype on encoding-related hippocampal and dPFC activity in BD, although Met carriers showed superior memory performance after the scan, which could be related to more efficient perceptual processing during encoding. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nCognitive impairments in bipolar disorder (BD) are associated with reduced functional capacity and poor prognosis ( ). Specifically, patients\u2019 verbal memory and executive function are among the strongest predictors for vocational capacity ( ). The pattern of cognitive impairment in BD is heterogeneous, as some patients remain cognitively intact while up to 60% present with selective or global impairments ( ). It is likely that genetic factors play a role in this heterogeneity, but the contribution of risk genotypes to the cognitive impairments in BD is poorly understood. It is important to gain a better understanding of these relationships and the factors that contribute to the cognitive heterogeneity seen in BD in order to offer personalized treatments and identify new therapeutic targets. \n\nSeveral candidate vulnerability marker genes believed to confer risk of cognitive deficits in psychiatric disorders have been explored using cognitive assessments and imaging genetics ( ). These include the Val66Met single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its relationship with memory function. In the Val66Met polymorphism, a valine to methionine substitution at codon 66 results in a switch from guanine to adenine at position 196 in the pro-region of the BDNF gene, leading to reduced activity-dependent BDNF secretion and potential associated changes in hippocampal functions such as episodic memory ( ,  ). \n\nThere is some evidence suggesting that the Val66Met polymorphism affects cognition and neural processing, although findings from existing studies are mixed ( \u2013 ). A systematic review of studies using clinical and healthy populations found that 23 of 63 studies showed a significant relationship between memory and Val66Met carrier status ( ). For example, Egan et al. ( ) found reduced free recall memory for an auditory short story in Met carriers, which is known to rely on the hippocampus, although this effect of genotype was not present on a second measure of free recall [California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT)]. Some studies have also reported relationships between Val66Met and aspects of memory that are known to be less dependent of the hippocampus such as recognition memory ( ,  ). However, in a study using a similar task to the task used in the current study, Dodds et al. ( ) presented healthy participants with scene pictures during encoding and asked participants to make indoor/outdoor judgments of the pictures as they were presented. Subsequently, participants completed a recognition memory test indicating whether the presented pictures were old or new. This study found no differences in memory performance or neural activity during encoding between BDNF Val66Met genotypes among these healthy individuals. However, subsequent studies using similar paradigms have found both reduced ( ) and increased ( ) MTL activity during memory encoding, and hence, inconsistencies in studies with healthy participants remain. \n\nGiven the albeit mixed evidence for impact of BDNF genotype on memory performance and related neural processing across healthy and psychiatric populations, it is pertinent to consider that BDNF genotype might play a role in the cognitive heterogeneity seen in BD but only few studies have investigated the relationship between memory and Val66Met genotype in BD. One study showed that Met carriers with BD displayed reduced verbal memory performance (and smaller hippocampal volumes) compared to both healthy and depressed Met carriers, suggesting a specific disadvantage for Met carrier BD patients on memory function ( ). Another study using a more general screening for cognitive function including memory did not find an association with Val66Met status ( ). To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the neural underpinnings of the association between BDNF Val66Met genotype and memory performance in BD, which may provide a more sensitive measure of the relationship between genotype, memory function, and neural mechanisms. \n\nIn this study, we investigated the effects of BDNF genotype on encoding-related hippocampal and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity and memory retrieval in a strategic picture-encoding task in 70 patients with BD in full or partial remission. We used a picture encoding task identical to Dodds et al. ( ) but used a free recall memory task to assess memory performance instead of a recognition task. Free recall of complex scenes relies heavily on the hippocampus ( ) and also the PFC ( ,  ) and these neural mechanisms appear to be specific for free recall over for instance item memory ( \u2013 ). Further, studies have indicated a possible advantage of Met carriers in terms of PFC function and working memory ( \u2013 ). For instance, one study showed that over-expression of BDNF in mice resulted in decreased working memory function ( ). Also, altered PFC activity has been associated with cognitive deficits in BD ( ,  ). Hence, we hypothesized that i) Met carriers would show reduced hippocampal and/or increased dorsal PFC (dPFC) activity during picture encoding and ii) this altered activity would be associated with impaired free recall for the encoded pictures. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSeventy BD patients in partial or full remission were included in the study. Baseline data for the patients was obtained from patients\u2019 participation in two randomized intervention studies investigating cognitive function in BD ( ,  ). Participants were between 18 and 65 years of age (mean \u00b1 SD; 37 \u00b1 10) and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. All participants were screened with Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) to confirm diagnosis of BD. Participants were also rated on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS-17; ( )] and Young Mania Scale [YMRS; ( )] to confirm that they were in partial or full remission (HDRS and YMRS scores \u226414). The original studies were approved by the local ethics committee, Danish Data Agency, and Danish Medicines Agency, and written consent was obtained from all participants prior to beginning of the study. For further details on the recruitment and screening processes, please see previous studies ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Genotyping \n  \nGenomic DNA was extracted from blood samples with the Maxwell Blood DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s protocol and the samples were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium PsychArrayBeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). \n\n\n### Magnetic Resonance Imaging \n  \nfMRI data was collected at the Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance with an eight-channel head coil on a 3T Siemens Trio MR scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Blood oxygen level-dependent T2*-weighted functional images were acquired using echo-planar imaging (EPI) with the following parameters: repetition time (TR), 2490 ms; echo time, 30 ms; slice thickness, 3 mm; field of view (FOV), 192 \u00d7 192 mm using a 64 \u00d7 64 grid, flip angle 20\u00b0. A total of 117 volumes were acquired in a single fMRI session and each volume consisted of 42 slices. A field-map was recorded to allow distortion correction of the acquired EPI images. Participants also underwent a high-resolution structural scan where a T1-weighted 3D structural image was acquired to co-register with the functional images, with the following parameters: TI = 800, TE = 3.93, TR = 1540 ms, flip angle 9\u00b0, 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm voxel size, 256\u00d7256 FOV, and 192 slices. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Analysis \n  \n#### Pre-Processing \n  \nPre-processing was carried out with the fMRI Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT; version 6.0) in FMRIB\u2019s software library (FSL;  ). Standard pre-processing steps included non-brain removal, realignment, correction for B0 field distortions, slice time correction, and spatial normalization of functional and structural images to a Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) template. The normalized functional images were spatially smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian smoothing kernel with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 5 mm. The time series in each session was high pass filtered (to max. 0.008 Hz). \n\n\n#### Statistical Analysis \n  \nAt the first level, picture encoding and rest events were modelled as boxcar functions and convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. A picture encoding BOLD contrast was computed by subtracting non-encoding periods from the picture encoding events. \n\nAt group level, we assessed differences in the picture-encoding contrast task between the two genotype groups. The group-level statistical estimation was carried out using nonparametric permutation tests with the FSL Randomise tool ( ,  ) using default settings and 5000 permutations. This method was used as it has been shown that permutation testing produces nominal results for clusterwise inference, while parametric statistical methods failed to do so ( ). ValVal and Met carrier genotype groups were contrasted for each of the pre-determined regions of interest (ROIs). The ROIs were constructed on the MNI template and included bilateral hippocampi and the dPFC. The hippocampal ROI was anatomically defined, while the dPFC ROI was a spherical ROI based on a previous paper investigating dPFC activity during encoding and subsequent free recall ( ) ( ). The bilateral hippocampus was defined using cortical maps thresholded at 30% provided by the Harvard-Oxford cortical structure atlas implemented in FSLView ( ). In addition to these ROI analyses, we conducted an exploratory whole-brain analysis applying a brain mask to investigate whether genotype groups\u2019 encoding-related activity differed in any other (unforeseen) regions. For analyses at the group level, demographic variables including age, sex, years of education, and clinical variables (HDRS and YMRS) were modelled as regressors of no interest. The resulting data were assessed using Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) to identify potential clusters ( ). \n  \nVisualization of the dPFC (above) and hippocampal (below) ROIs. \n  \nFinally, we extracted the encoding-related BOLD signal change from the predefined ROIs and any additional regions showing differential response between genotype groups and correlated these values with participants subsequent recall score. \n\n\n\n### Picture Encoding and Retrieval Task \n  \nStimuli pictures consisted of images of complex scenes collected from the International Affective Picture System [IAPS; ( )]. Several studies have demonstrated that encoding of such complex images is related to hippocampal activity ( ,  ). All images were matched for valence, arousal, and complexity. Participants received instructions on the screen prior to the beginning of the task. During fMRI, participants viewed six 24-s picture blocks, each block consisting of six pictures. Each picture was presented on the screen for 3 s followed by an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 1 s in a pseudo-randomized order. Each picture block was followed by a short rest in which participants saw a fixation cross presented in the middle of the screen for 24 s. The total duration of the task was approximately 5 min. Participants were instructed to pay careful attention to the presented pictures, as they would be required to complete a subsequent memory task. Hence, the task comprised a strategic memory-encoding component. Participants were also instructed to make indoor-outdoor judgments for each picture, ensuring that participants paid attention to the task. Each picture block contained an equal number of indoor and outdoor scenes. \n\nImmediately following the scanning session, participants completed a free recall test of the pictures, in which participants were instructed to tell the experimenter about as many pictures they could remember and describe each picture in detail. One point was awarded for each remembered picture, yielding a total free recall score. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nAnalyses of behavioral data and extracted mean percent signal change from the identified clusters in the FSL Randomise analysis were performed using SPSS (version 22; IBM Corporation). \n\nAs only a small number (N = 4) of participants carried the MetMet genotype, ValMet and MetMet carriers were pooled together in a Met-carrier (MetCar) group (N = 26) and compared to ValVal homozygotes (N = 43). Performance on the picture memory task was calculated as the number of correctly recalled images on the free recall test. For each participant, a raw score was calculated with a score of 1 being given for each remembered picture. The total number of false positives was also recorded. ValVal vs MetCar genotypes were compared for demographic and clinical variables and performance on memory tests using independent samples t-tests (two-tailed) and \u03c7 . The relationship between neural activity in ROIs/significant clusters and memory performance was assessed with Pearson\u2019s correlations and Fisher\u2019s r to z transformation. Likewise, the relationship between clinical measures, age, years of education, memory recall, and neural activity was assessed with Pearson\u2019s correlations. Interaction effects between genotype and total number of medications on memory recall and encoding-related activity was assessed with a univariate ANOVA. \n\nFor all tests, it was ensured that assumptions were met, and where assumptions were violated, data were either square-root transformed to fit a Gaussian distribution or analyzed with non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U). The alpha-level was set at P = 0.05. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nOf the 70 participants recruited for the study, two participants had missing behavioral data and were omitted from fMRI analyses, yielding N = 68 subjects (ValVal: N = 42; ValMet/MetMet: N = 26) for analysis. There were no differences between the ValVal and the ValMet/MetMet genotype groups in demographic or clinical variables including age, years in education, age at onset, illness duration, number of hospitalisations, mood symptoms, or medication status (P > 0.05;  ). \n  \nMeans (SD) for demographic and clinical variables, picture memory task performance, and significance levels for differences between the ValVal and the ValMet/MetMet groups in remitted patients with bipolar disorder. \n  \nHDRS-17, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 items; YMRS, Young Mania Rating Scale; SD, standard deviation. \n  \n### Functional MRI Analysis \n  \n#### Main Effect of Task \n  \nTo confirm that the task was associated with the expected activity in visual areas and the hypothesized ROIs, we carried out a non-parametric one-sample t-test across all subjects showing that picture encoding was associated with activity in a large network of brain regions, including the dorsal PFC, occipital, parietal, and temporal regions (see  ; network shown in green). Across all participants, picture encoding vs. baseline was also associated with increased activity in the predefined ROIs: the bilateral hippocampi and the dPFC (TFCE corrected P < 0.05). \n  \nEncoding activity during encoding across all participating remitted patients with bipolar disorder, showing activity in a large network (marked in green).

An exploratory whole-brain analysis showed that Met carriers displayed greater activity in a cluster located to the lateral occipital (LO) cortex compared to participants with the ValVal genotype (peak coordinate: x = \u201358 y = \u201366, z = \u20138;  ;  ). \n  \nSignificant clusters for the picture encoding task. Cluster peak and local maximum is represented with x, y, z MNI coordinates and Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement corrected P-values. \n  \nL, left; MNI, Montreal Neurologic Institute; R, right; TFCE, Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement. \n  \n\n#### Relationship Between Neural Activity and Memory Performance \n  \nAcross all subjects, there was no statistically significant correlation between hippocampal activity (mean % signal change) and memory recall, r(68) = 0.07, P = 0.56. There was also no statistically significant difference in this correlation between the ValVal (r = -0.07, P = 0.65) and the Met carrier (r = 0.05, P = 0.80) groups, Z = - 0.47, P = 0.64. In the dPFC, there was no statistically significant correlation between memory recall and mean % signal change, r(68) = 0.10, P = 0.42, although when comparing the correlations for the two genotypes, these were significantly different, Z = 2.33, P = 0.02, which was due to a positive correlation between mean % signal change in the dPFC and memory for ValVal [r(42) = 0.29, P = 0.06], while this correlation was negative for Met carriers, r(24) = -0.31, P = 0.13. We also investigated the relationship between memory recall and the activity in the identified significant cluster in the occipital lobe across all subjects but this correlation was also non-significant r (68) = 0.17, P = 0.17. Furthermore, there was no difference in correlation between activity in the significant cluster and memory recall between the two groups, Z = 0.65, P = 0.51. \n\n\n\n### Behavioral Analyses \n  \nPicture recall after the scan: An independent samples t-test carried out on the square root-transformed data showed that unexpectedly, Met carriers displayed a superior picture memory performance (higher number of correctly recalled pictures) in comparison with Val homozygotes [mean \u00b1 SD, Met carriers: 10.3 \u00b1 5.0, Val homozygotes: 8.0 \u00b1 5.3; t(67) = 2.35, P = 0.02, d = 0.61;  ]. There were no differences between the two groups in the number of false positives (i.e., \u201cmade up\u201d pictures) (U = 437.0, P = 0.71, \u03b7  = 0.002). There were no significant correlations between picture recall and sub-syndromal mania or depression symptoms, age, and years of education in either of the two groups or across the entire sample (P \u2265 0.20). Use of antidepressants, lithium, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and diazepines was not associated with memory recall (P \u2265 0.13). There was no significant interaction effect between val66met BDNF genotype and total number of medications on memory recall (P = 0.23). The main effect of medication was also non-significant (P = 0.27). \n  \nMean memory score on the picture memory task for the ValVal and the ValMet/MetMet groups in remitted patients with bipolar disorder. Error bars represent SE. Significance of asterisk is at the 0.05 level (exact p-value is P = 0.02). \n  \n\n### Associations Between Mood, Medication and BOLD Response \n  \nTo investigate whether associations with mood or medication status could explain our obtained fMRI results, we carried out the following analyses: Across the entire sample, subsyndromal depression symptoms showed a negative correlation with mean % signal change in the bilateral hippocampus   (HDRS  ;   r   = -0.25,   P   = 0.04). This effect was due to a strong relationship between HDRS scores and hippocampal activity within the ValVal group (r = -0.49, P < 0.001), while there was no significant relationship between HDRS scores and hippocampal activity in the Met carrier group alone (r = 0.28, P = 0.17). For the dPFC and the identified cluster in the LO cortex, there were no significant relationships between mean % signal change in these regions during encoding and HDRS or YMRS scores across the entire sample (P\u2019s > 0.20) or within the genotype groups (P\u2019s > 0.19). \n\nUse of antidepressants, lithium, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and diazepines was not associated with mean percent BOLD signal change in the hippocampal or dPFC ROIs or in the identified LO cortex cluster (P\u2019s \u2265 0.05). Assessing the effects of the total number of medications on neural activity during encoding, there was no significant interaction between val66met BDNF genotype and total number of medications for encoding-related activity in the dPFC or hippocampal ROIs, or in the identified LO cortex cluster (P > 0.05). \n\n\n### Sensitivity Analyses \n  \nTo rule out the effects of subsyndromal symptoms in the current analyses, we conducted a sensitivity analysis only including the participants in full remission (HDRS < 7; YMRS < 7), yielding a total of 34 datasets for analysis. \n\nLike in the full dataset, participants that were carriers of the Met allele showed numerically better memory performance (M = 10.17, SD = 4.51) compared to ValVal homozygotes (M = 7.62, SD = 4.40), although this effect did not reach significance for this subset of participants, t(31) = 1.59, P = 0.12. Consistent with the analyses conducted on all participants, for fMRI analyses, there was no significant effect of genotype on activity during encoding in the bilateral hippocampal ROI or the dPFC. An exploratory whole-brain analysis did also not show any significant effect of genotype on activity during encoding. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe investigated for the first time the effects of BDNF Val66Met genotype on encoding-related hippocampal response and memory performance in partially or fully remitted patients with BD. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found no impact of this BDNF genotype on hippocampal (or dorsal PFC response) during picture encoding. However, an exploratory whole-brain analysis showed that Met carriers displayed greater encoding-related neural activity in the LO cortex compared to ValVal homozygotes. At a behavioral level, Met carriers also displayed superior picture recall following the encoding session in the scanner compared to the ValVal homozygotes. \n\nThe lack of an association between BDNF genotype and hippocampal activity during encoding is in accordance with a previous study on healthy volunteers using an identical picture encoding task ( ) but contrasts with other similar studies showing either no difference ( ) or increased ( ) MTL activity during encoding of complex scenes in healthy subjects. The lack of a healthy control group in this study to serve as a baseline challenges the interpretation of the current findings in relation to existing studies in healthy volunteers and hence comprises a limitation of the current study. Nevertheless, investigating the relationship between BDNF genotype, memory, and neural mechanisms in BD alone can still be used to identify potential mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity in cognitive impairment across BD patients. In this context, our results do not suggest that differences in hippocampal processing during memory encoding between Met carriers and ValVal homozygotes contribute to cognitive heterogeneity in BD. \n\nIn the exploratory whole-brain analysis, we observed an effect of BDNF Val66Met genotype on neural processing in a cluster located to the LO cortex, with Met carriers showing greater activity during encoding in this region compared to ValVal homozygotes, indicating a potential difference in visual processing that is dependent on genotype. The lateral occipital cortex is known to be involved in visual processing and object perception and recognition ( ) and has specifically been implicated in identifying object shapes ( ). Why encoding-related processing in this area should be greater in Met carriers than ValVal homozygotes is not clear, but this finding is consistent with the observed better memory recall in the Met carrier group, although we did not observe a significant relationship between the mean percent BOLD signal change extracted from the identified cluster and subsequent memory performance. \n\nSurprisingly, we observed better picture recall in BD Met carriers than in ValVal homozygotes. This was in contrast to our hypothesis that Met carriers would show reduced memory performance and also contradicts the majority of studies reporting a relationship between BDNF genotype and memory performance, where higher Met load is often associated with poorer memory in both healthy volunteers ( ,  ,  ) and BD ( ,  ). In terms of comparison with results from studies using healthy volunteers, we expected that potential effects of Val66Met BDNF genotype would be exacerbated in BD. However, it is possible that residual BD symptoms might instead blunt potential differences due to BDNF genotype. Another possibility is that different methods of memory assessment explain the divergent findings; we used a free recall task of complex scenes whereas others investigating the relationship between BDNF genotype and memory in BD have used other tasks such as the CVLT ( ,  ). Hence, it is possible that subtle differences in the mechanisms supporting different memory types might have played a role in the divergent findings, where Met carriers may be impaired compared to ValVal homozygotes on a verbal learning task but not a visual learning task, which is consistent with our finding showing increased activity during encoding in the LO cortex known to play a role in visual processing. \n\nAlso, some studies have suggested that there might be a possible advantage of Met carriers in terms of PFC function and working memory ( ). Free recall is dependent on both PFC processing and working memory function and we did see a significant positive correlation between dPFC activity during encoding and subsequent memory for the Met carrier group that was not present in the ValVal group. Hence, it is possible that Met carriers more efficiently recruited the dPFC during encoding. \n\nAnother point is that the previous studies showing better performance for ValVal homozygotes compared to Met carriers in psychiatric populations have often used samples including both remitted and currently depressed patients (e.g. 15). Such samples may show reduced performance on cognitive tasks due to patients\u2019 affective symptoms ( ), which might interact with Met load. A strength of the current study was the inclusion of a relatively homogeneous sample of remitted or partially remitted BD patients, which limited confounding effects of affective symptoms compared to previous studies. However, this study did include patients in both partial and full remission, and hence, sub-syndromal mood symptoms could have had an impact on memory performance in this study too. In this context, we found a negative correlation between residual depression symptoms and hippocampal activity during encoding across the entire sample, suggesting that patients with more depressive symptoms recruited the hippocampus less efficiently during learning. This observation is consistent with the state-related impairments in learning and memory seen in depression. Interestingly, this association was more pronounced in the ValVal homozygotes who are believed to have more activity-dependent hippocampal BDNF trafficking and greater encoding-related hippocampal response when healthy ( ). \n\nTo further address the potential significance of residual depressive symptoms, we carried out sensitivity analyses only including patients in full remission and consistent with the main analyses, we found no significant effect of genotype on activity during encoding in the predefined dPFC or hippocampal ROIs. For the sensitivity analyses, the whole-brain analyses did not yield any significant effect of genotype. However it should be noted that the sample size was dramatically reduced in these analyses (N = 33). \n\nFor the main analyses, we used a relatively large sample size (N = 68) for assessment of differences between the genotype groups in encoding-related neural activity. In comparison, other studies used between 22 and 58 participants ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Due to a small number of participants with the MetMet genotype (N = 4), we decided to not compare patients with the MetMet and ValMet genotypes. We were thus unable to explore a potential association between Met load and clinical, cognitive and neural responses as done in previous studies ( ,  ). Indeed, this could have brought more clarity to the current results showing a weak advantage for Met-carriers on the free recall task. Further, as all participants received psychotropic medication it cannot be excluded that this has influenced the present result. Finally, as mentioned previously, having a healthy control group to serve as a baseline and comparison with previous studies using healthy subjects would have been an advantage. \n\nIn conclusion, we found no association between BDNF val66met genotype and hippocampal or dorsal PFC activity during picture encoding, although Met carriers showed an unexpected greater picture recall after the scan. Exploratory whole-brain analysis revealed larger lateral occipital cortex response in Met carriers, which might reflect increased visual processing during picture encoding in this group, although activity in this region did not correlate with subsequent memory performance. Instead, Met carriers might show more efficient processing in the dPFC during encoding compared to ValVal carriers. The absence of effects of BDNF val66met genotype on memory-related hippocampal response in our BD sample may be due to the effects of subsyndromal symptoms overriding more subtle effects of BDNF val66met genotype since we allowed subsyndromal symptoms in our sample in the interest of generalizability. Specifically, future studies should use even larger samples (n > 70), include a healthy control group, and investigate fully remitted BD patients (with scores <7 on HDRS and YMRS) or healthy, non-medicated participants at high risk for BD (first-degree relatives) to assess potential dose-dependent effects of Met load on neural and cognitive measures of learning and memory in BD. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this manuscript will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by De Videnskabsetiske Komit\u00e9er, Region Hovedstaden.

However, the mechanisms by which GCBT improves asthma-related clinical symptoms remain unknown. Previous studies have indicated that insula is an important region involved in the neuropathology of asthma. Therefore, we examined the possible alteration of functional connectivity (FC) in insula subregions after GCBT in asthmatic patients. \n\n Methods:   Forty-two asthmatic patients and 60 healthy controls (HCs) received resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scan and clinical assessments, 17 asthmatic patients completed GCBT treatment consisting of 8 sessions, and then received rs-fMRI scan and clinical assessments. \n\n Results:   Asthmatic patients had greater left ventral anterior insula (vAI) FC with the left cerebellum posterior lobe, right middle temporal gyrus, and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but less FC with bilateral postcentral gyrus, bilateral occipital lobe, and left precentral gyrus compared with HCs. FC between left posterior insula and left medial frontal gyrus also increased in the patients. In addition, right vAI showed increased FC with right caudate and left putamen. FC between right dorsal anterior insula (dAI) and left calcarine however decreased. The increase in FC in insula subregions were significantly improved following GCBT. FC between the left vAI connectivity and left postcentral gyrus was positively correlated with the percentage of improvement in 17-items Hamilton depression rating scale scores, and FC between the right dAI and left calcarine was negatively associated with the improvement percentage in asthma control test scores. \n\n Conclusions:   This study in the first time demonstrated that GCBT led to significant improvement of FC between insula subregions and other brain regions. \n\n Clinical Trial Registration:   An investigation of therapeutic mechanism in asthmatic patients: based on the results of Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (Registration number: ChiCTR-COC-15007442) ( ). \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nBronchial asthma is a common multifactorial chronic inflammatory respiratory disease that results in reversible airflow restriction. To et al. ( ) combined data from the World Health Survey collected in 2002\u20132003 to generate global estimate of asthma burden, which suggested that asthma prevalence ranged from a low of 1.04% in Vietnam to 21.51% in Australia. In China, a recent epidemiological study reported that the prevalence of asthma is 39.52% (Ding et al.,  ). The prevalence of depression has reached 13.41% among Chinese asthmatic patients (Liu et al.,  ). And depression increases the risk of asthma in adults (Tousman et al.,  ). Previous study demonstrated that group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) can improve asthma-related quality of life and depression symptoms (Yorke et al.,  ). However, little is known about the mechanisms. \n\nWith the development of neuroimaging techniques, it has become increasingly possible to observe the neurobiological underpinnings of psychotherapeutic interventions. To the best of our knowledge, GCBT-related neuroimaging studies in asthmatic patients have not yet been reported. Our previous study demonstrated that successful GCBT is associated with a reversed effect on the coordination of spontaneous brain activity in the bilateral occipital lobe and sensorimotor cortex (Zhang et al.,  ). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the relationships between GCBT and functional changes in certain brain regions were also found in patients suffering from depression (Yoshimura et al.,  ) and anxiety disorder (Doehrmann et al.,  ). These studies advanced our understanding of the mechanisms by which GCBT improves symptoms. \n\nFMRI also holds a great promise for finding the mechanisms underlying the diseases and testing new treatments (Pattinson,  ). Rosenkranz et al. ( ,  ) explored the relationship between asthma and brain by fMRI and found that insula was hyper-responsive to asthma-related emotional and afferent physiological symptoms. Banzett et al. ( ) also reported that the perception of dyspnea activated the insula cortex in healthy subjects. Insula as a \u201ccortical hub\u201d receives afferent input from lamina I spinothalamocortical tract, carries information pertaining to shortness of breath, and has strong connections with neural structures essential in processing emotional information (Liotti et al.,  ; Rosenkranz et al.,  ; Nieuwenhuys,  ; Borsook et al.,  ). However, those previous studies were mostly focused on the local function of insula (Banzett et al.,  ; Rosenkranz and Davidson,  ; Rosenkranz et al.,  ), its connectivity with other brain regions was not addressed. Furthermore, insula is divided into several subregions, including ventral anterior region which is related to chemosensory and socioemotional processing, dorsal anterior region which is involved in high cognitive processing, and posterior region which is associated with pain and sensorimotor processing (Li et al.,  ). The first aim of this study sought to explore if the insula functional connectivity (FC) of asthmatic patients was abnormal. The second aim was to investigate the therapeutic mechanism of GCBT for asthma. We deduced that asthmatic patients would exhibit abnormal insula subregions FC compared with healthy controls (HCs). Certain abnormal FC in asthmatic patients would be possibly reversed or normalized after GCBT. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nAfter consulting the statistical professor, calculating the sample size, and referencing previous related-studies (Klumpp et al.,  ; Yoshimura et al.,  ; Mason et al.,  ), 42 patients with a diagnosis of bronchial asthma without acute attacks and 60 HCs were recruited. Twenty-one asthmatic patients volunteered to participate in 8 weeks of GCBT, only 17 patients completed the whole course. The average age of 17 patients was 50.76 years (standard deviation = 12.15) with 7 were males and 10 were females. \n\nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the ethics committee (Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China) with written informed consent from all subjects. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Inclusion/exclusion criteria \n  \nParticipants who met the following criteria entered subject group: (1) were all at least 18 years old; (2) were right-handed; (3) had an educational level of junior high school at least; (4) met the diagnostic criteria of bronchial asthma and during non-acute attacks; (5) HCs were required to have a score below 7 on the 17 items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17). \n\nParticipants were excluded if they presented with other serious physical diseases, psychotic disorders, alcohol, or drug dependence or are pregnant, lactating. Participants with implanted electronic or other metal devices (such as a cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, or stent) were also excluded. \n\n\n### Evaluations \n  \n#### HDRS-17 \n  \nAll subjects including both test and control groups were given HDRS-17 evaluation. GCBT group was given another time at the end of 8-weeks GCBT. HDRS-17 (Hamilton,  ) contains 17 variables which are measured on five-point scales, and it is used to assess the depression severity. Participants with a score equal or above 7 are considered to have depression. \n\n\n#### Asthma control test (ACT) \n  \nAll asthmatic patients completed ACT. GCBT group did again at the end of 8-weeks GCBT. ACT (Nathan et al.,  ) contains 5 items with a total score arranging from 0 to 25. Patients with a total score below 20 are thought to have uncontrolled asthma. \n\n\n\n### Intervention \n  \nGCBT group received GCBT once a week for 1 h over an 8-week period and received GCBT according to the cognitive behavioral therapy manual developed by Beck ( ). GCBT consisted of 8 sessions, with each session lasting approximately 60 min weekly. It was delivered in a small group of 6\u20138 patients. The content of sessions was focused on helping patients acquire asthma-related knowledge, teaching them methods to identify and modify irrational thoughts that might deduce asthma exacerbation and maintenance, enhancing problem-solving strategies and decision-making skills to deal with practical issues of asthma control, and managing medication use and favorable behaviors. The detailed content of GCBT was displayed in Table  . \n  \n Outline of GCBT  . \n  \n\n### Brain image acquisition \n  \nImaging was performed on a 3-Tesla Scanner using a homogeneous birdcage head coil. Participants were required to keep their eyes closed, awake, and not think of specific things during scanning. Participants lay supine with the head snugly fixed by a belt and foam pads to minimize head motion. A gradient-recalled echo-planar imaging (GRE-EPI) pulse sequence was set up to acquire resting-state images. For each data volume, we acquired 36 continuous axial-slices in descending order with 3.75 \u00d7 3.75 mm in-plane resolution parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line, 3 mm slice thickness and a 0 mm gap using resting-state imaging (TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 25 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, acquisition matrix = 64 \u00d7 64, field of view = 240 \u00d7 240 mm). This acquisition sequence generated 240 volumes in 8 min. \n\n\n### Functional imaging preprocessing \n  \nAll image data were reconstructed and inspected by two experienced radiologists. Image preprocessing was performed using the DPARSF software (Chao-Gan and Yu-Feng,  ). The first 10 time points were discarded for scanner calibration and for subjects to get used to the circumstance. The remaining time points were corrected for timing differences between slices and for motion effects (six-parameter rigid body) using a reference volume in the center of the run. After head motion correction, participants with head motion of more than 2.5 mm of maximum displacement in any direction (x, y, or z) or 2.5\u00b0 of angular motion were ruled out. The resulting images were spatially normalized into a standard stereotaxic space using a 12-parameter affine approach and an EPI template image that was resampled to 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm  voxels. Following this, temporal filtering (0.01 Hz < f < 0.08 Hz) was applied to the time series of each voxel to reduce the effect of low-frequency drifts and high-frequency noise. Any linear trend was then eliminated. \n\n\n### Selection of region of interest (ROI) \n  \nThe regions of interest (ROIs) were selected according to the previous research (Deen et al.,  ), in which insula was divided into ventral anterior insula (vAI), dorsal anterior insula (dAI), and posterior insula (PI) for both right and left. The bilateral insula subregions were defined anatomically by drawing insula gray matter on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 standard brain. Each voxel in the insula subregion ROIs (converted to 3-mm resolution) was used as a seed in a whole-brain functional connectivity analysis in both asthmatic patients and HCs. \n\n\n### FC analysis \n  \nThe FC analysis was supported by REST tool kit ( ) (Song et al.,  ). Global trend, white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained by averaging the time series within the whole brain, WM and CSF masks, respectively. For each insula-ROI, a seed referenced time course was obtained by averaging the time series of all voxels in the ROI. Then Pearson's correlation analysis was performed between the seed reference time course and time series of each voxel in the brain in a voxel wise way. And a Fisher's z-transform was applied to improve the normality of the correlation coefficients (Lowe et al.,  ). Six head motion parameters and the mean time series of global signals, WM signals and CSF signals were introduced as covariates into a random effects model to remove possible effects of head motion, global signal, WM signal and CSF signals on the results. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nPredictive Analytic Software (PASW) Statistics 18 package was employed (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) to complete the analyses. Age, education, and HDRS-17 were analyzed by independent-samples   t  -test. Gender was compared by means of the Chi-square test. Paired-samples   t  -test was used to compared the scale scores before and after GCBT.   P   < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. \n\nTo determine the underpinnings of GCBT in the context of asthma, an independent-samples   t  -test was performed on the groups' insula subregions FC maps in a voxel-by-voxel manner, with age, gender, and education level as covariates at baseline. AlphaSim correction based on Monte Carlo simulation algorithm was used to correct for multiple comparisons [single voxel   P   = 0.005/6, FWHM = 6 mm, with 61 \u00d7 73 \u00d7 61 mm  gray matter mask, which yielded a corrected threshold of   P   < 0.005, cluster sizes > 945 mm , ( )]. Then, abnormal brain regions by baseline comparison with controls were selected as seeds for a subsequent paired-samples   t  -test between pre- and post-GCBT scores. AlphaSim correction was also used to correct for multiple comparisons (single voxel   P   = 0.005, FWHM = 6 mm, with selected masks, which yielded a corrected threshold of   P   < 0.005, cluster sizes > 189, 81, 108, 108 mm  for the FC of left vAI, left PI, right vAI, and right dAI respectively). The analyses were performed using the REST extract ROI series also from REST tool kit. Pearson's correlation analyses were then performed to examine correlations between abnormal brain regions'   z  -values and psychological performance of asthmatic patients using PASW 18.0 software. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and clinical data \n  \nTable   showed the detailed demographic information and scale scores before and after GCBT. Patients were significantly older than HCs (  P   < 0.05) which would be a covariate in the following statistical analysis of insula FC. There were no significant differences between asthmatic patients and HCs in terms of gender and education level. HDRS-17 scores of patients were significantly higher than HCs' (  P   < 0.001). After GCBT, patients showed significantly higher ACT scores and lower HDRS-17 scores (  P   < 0.001). \n  \n Demographics and clinical characteristics of asthmatic patients and health controls  . \n  \n Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation  . \n\n HDRS, 17-items Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; GCBT, group cognitive behavior therapy; ACT, asthma control test  . \n  \n\n### FC results in asthmatic patients and HCs at baseline \n  \nCompared with HCs, asthmatic patients showed that the left vAI has an increased FC with left cerebellum posterior lobe, right middle temporal gyrus, and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and decreased FC with bilateral postcentral gyrus, bilateral occipital lobe, and left precentral gyrus (Table  , Figure  ). They also showed an increased FC between left PI and left medial frontal gyrus (Table  , Figure  ). In the right insula, increased FC was found between right vAI with right caudate and left putamen (Table  , Figure  ). A decreased FC was found between right dAI and left calcarine (Table  , Figure  ). However, no significant differences of FC in both the left dAI and right PI were found between asthmatic patients and HCs. \n  \n Brain regions showed altered FC in asthmatic patients compared with HCs  . \n  \n Threshold was set at P < 0.005/6 (AlphaSim-corrected, cluster size > 945 mm  for left vAI, left PI, right vAI, right dAI respectively).

FC between left PI and left medial frontal gyrus were also reversed to the level of pre-GCBT (Table  , Figure  ). And FC was reversed between right vAI with left caudate and right putamen (Table  , Figure  ). After GCBT, the insula FC with other brain regions (including bilateral parietal lobe, bilateral postcentral gyrus, right precuneus, left precentral gyrus, and left calcarine) were significantly decreased in asthmatic patients (Table  , Figures  ). \n  \n Paired t-statistic maps of insula subregions FC between post- and pre-GCBT in asthmatic patients (  P   < 0.005, AlphaSim corrected)  .

After GCBT, the change of FC between left vAI and left postcentral cortex was found positively correlated with the percentage improvement in HDRS-17 scores (Figure  ). The change of FC between right dAI and left calcarine, however, showed a negatively correlation with the percentage of improvement in ACT scores (Figure  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussions \n  \nThe current study at the first time reported that GCBT might modify FC between insula subregions and other certain brain regions. \n\nIn the present study, compared with HCs, asthmatic patients showed hyper-connectivity between left vAI with left cerebellum posterior lobe, right middle temporal gyrus, and bilateral ACC, and between left PI with left medial frontal gyrus, and between right vAI with right caudate and left putamen. The findings are similar to that reported by Dodd et al. ( ) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) showing, a higher activation in almost all gray matter resting-state networks (including ventral- dorsal network, default mode network, bilateral fronto-parietal network, sensorimotor network, and prefrontal network). In our study, FC between visual network with both left vAI and right dAI were decreased. Taken together, these findings further suggested that asthmatic patients may indeed have widespread neuronal abnormalities. Asthmatic patients showed reduced FC between left vAI and sensorimotor areas, consistent with previous reports in COPD patients showing reduced cortical thickness, surface area (Chen et al.,  ), and deoxyhaemoglobin (Higashimoto et al.,  ) in sensorimotor areas. These studies suggested that abnormal breathing which results in the unbalance of carbon dioxide in cerebrovascular system might influence the function of sensorimotor areas. Interestingly, decreased FC between left vAI and right postcentral gyrus was found to be negatively correlated with asthma control level, which supported that reduced left vAI FC with sensorimotor areas might involve in the impaired breathing pattern. \n\nStraube et al. ( ) found a significant reduction of hyperactivity in the insula and ACC in spider phobic patients after CBT. CBT also decreases the metabolism in the left cerebellum and ACC in the panic patients (Sakai et al.,  ). Neuroimaging revealed that vAI is connected to visceromotor regions that regulates allostasis, as well as regions representing interoceptive and other sensory inputs associated to affective experience (Deen et al.,  ; Touroutoglou et al.,  ). The cerebellum posterior lobe (Paradiso et al.,  ; Wildgruber et al.,  ), temporal lobe (Cauda et al.,  ), and ACC (Weidt et al.,  ) are believed to play essential roles in the integration of multimodal information vital in sensorimotor and emotional. Thus, we proposed that the reversed FC between left vAI and those above brain regions after GCBT might be related to the neurobiological mechanisms underlying improved asthma-related emotion or perception. \n\nReversed FC between right vAI with right caudate and left putamen after GCBT was consistent with the findings by Baxter et al. ( ) and Schwartz et al. ( ), that patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder showed decreased activation in the caudate after CBT. They demonstrated the idea that the pathological activity of cortical-striate-thalamic circuit can be responsible for the brain mechanism of both fixed, repetitive thoughts and behaviors in obsessive-compulsive disorder (Porto et al.,  ). Caudate is believed to play a crucial role in cognitive (Jaspers et al.,  ), thus, the reversed FC between right vAI and right caudate following GCBT would be possibly associated with the asthma-related twisted thoughts (e.g., catastrophic thoughts, irrational thoughts). In addition, patients with psychosis displayed reduced activation in the left putamen when they faced fearful and angry expression (Kumari et al.,  ). Since vAI is involved in emotional process (Li et al.,  ), the reversed FC between right vAI and left putamen might be associated with the improvement of emotion after GCBT. \n\nKucyi et al. ( ) explored the neurobiological mechanisms of CBT for healthy subjects who received painful thermal stimuli, suggesting that subjects received CBT shows reversed FC between areas of default mode (DMN) and executive control network (e.g., PI). Morris et al. ( ) detected the changes of brain function with virtual reality exposure therapy-a treatment similar to CBT, founding that the neurophysiological changes in middle frontal gyrus are related to pain catastrophization in patients with fibromyalgia. Since the neural structures that promote dyspnea and pain are shared (Nishino,  ), thus, GCBT might possibly modulate the asthma through affecting FC between left PI and left medial frontal gyrus. \n\nAlso of clinical importance was the GCBT-specific decrease in the left vAI connectivity with left postcentral gyrus, which was correlated with the improvement in depression severity. It suggested that patients exhibiting a strong decrease in FC between left vAI and left postcentral gyrus tended to have a strong improvement of the depression severity with GCBT. This may be attributable to the roles of the left vAI and postcentral gyrus in depression, which show decreased global FC density in patients with depression (Guo et al.,  ; Zhuo et al.,  ). Asthmatic patients also exhibited correlation between decreased FC (connectivity between right dAI and left calcarine) and improvement in asthma control level with GCBT. Madjar et al. ( ) have reported that spontaneous respiration influences the function of the occipital lobe, a region that is characterized by high vascular density. Therefore, it was possible that favorable asthma control could improve abnormal ventilation through changing the function of occipital lobe. \n\nA limitation of the current study was that the groups were not randomized, so we could not rule out effects of selection bias for take-up of GCBT. And this study used a relatively small sample, thus, the insula subregions FC in asthmatic patients with and without depression could not be further compared. In addition, the generalizability of the results might have been reduced due to the sampling strategy. To overcome these limitations, studies with larger sample sizes are needed in the future. \n\nIn summary, this study demonstrated that successful GCBT leads to the reorganization of insula subregions FC with certain brain regions. These changes included reversions of pathophysiology detected at baseline and some non-reversed changes. GCBT improved depression severity of asthmatic patients through modulating FC between left vAI and left postcentral, and asthma control level by affecting FC between right dAI and left calcarine. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nYYua was responsibility for experimental design.

Prediction errors (PEs) are thought to mediate flexible decision-making by updating the reward values associated with available actions. In this study, we explored whether the neurobiological correlates of PEs are altered in alcohol dependence. Behavioral, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were simultaneously acquired from 34 abstinent alcohol-dependent patients (ADP) and 26 healthy controls (HC) during a probabilistic reward-guided decision-making task with dynamically changing reinforcement contingencies. A hierarchical Bayesian inference method was used to fit and compare learning models with different assumptions about the amount of task-related information subjects may have inferred during the experiment. Here, we observed that the best-fitting model was a modified Rescorla-Wagner type model, the \u201cdouble-update\u201d model, which assumes that subjects infer the knowledge that reward contingencies are anti-correlated, and integrate both actual and hypothetical outcomes into their decisions. Moreover, comparison of the best-fitting model's parameters showed that ADP were less sensitive to punishments compared to HC. Hence, decisions of ADP after punishments were loosely coupled with the expected reward values assigned to them. A correlation analysis between the model-generated PEs and the fMRI data revealed a reduced association between these PEs and the BOLD activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of ADP. A hemispheric asymmetry was observed in the DLPFC when positive and negative PE signals were analyzed separately. The right DLPFC activity in ADP showed a reduced correlation with positive PEs. On the other hand, ADP, particularly the patients with high dependence severity, recruited the left DLPFC to a lesser extent than HC for processing negative PE signals. These results suggest that the DLPFC, which has been linked to adaptive control of action selection, may play an important role in cognitive inflexibility observed in alcohol dependence when reinforcement contingencies change. Particularly, the left DLPFC may contribute to this impaired behavioral adaptation, possibly by impeding the extinction of the actions that no longer lead to a reward. \n   Highlights  \n  \nAlcohol-dependent patients (ADP) had difficulty adapting to the reversals. \n  \nThe impaired adaptation was associated with a decrease in punishment sensitivity. \n  \nThe dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of ADP failed to track prediction errors. \n  \nA reduced tracking of the negative prediction error was present in the left DLPFC. \n  \nThe clinical severity of dependence was correlated with abnormal DLPFC activity. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAlcohol has been considered as the most harmful psychoactive substance when physical, psychological, and social effects are taken together ( ,  ). It can cause structural and functional changes in a network of cortical and subcortical structures ( ,  ,  ,  ). These alterations, which partly seem to persist during abstinence ( ,  ), gradually reduce cognitive control, deteriorating individual's ability to inhibit perseverative responses and adapt to the changes in environmental contingencies. Indeed, alcohol use disorder itself can be seen as an inability to adjust responses to stimuli formerly coupled with alcohol leading to habitual, perseverative consumption patterns ( ). \n\nProbabilistic reversal learning task (PRLT) has been traditionally used to assess cognitive flexibility in addiction ( ,  ). Experiments using PRLTs have demonstrated that various substance-dependent groups including alcohol, cocaine, and stimulant-dependent patients have difficulties adapting to reversals, i.e. abrupt changes in reward contingencies ( ,  ,  ,  ). Recently, there has been an increasing interest to understand the underlying computational mechanisms of these impairments in substance use disorder through reinforcement learning (RL) models ( ,  ,  ,  ). These models are based on the idea that while individuals tend to repeat the actions leading to rewards, they tend to cease the activities that give them punishments ( ). They rely on a teaching signal called \u201cprediction error,\u201d which quantifies the discrepancy between the estimated reward value of an action and the actual reward obtained by selecting that action. Learning takes place as PE updates the selected action's reward value, which then guides action selection on the next trial. More recently, it has been suggested that healthy human subjects in value-based decision-making tasks not only learn the expected reward value of the action they select, but also consider what they would have obtained if they selected the alternative action ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). The RL models accommodate this counterfactual learning via an additional fictive update rule that updates the reward expectancy of the unselected option, assuming that subjects consider the anti-correlated reward structure of the PRLT such that if one choice is likely to be rewarded, the alternative is likely to be punished ( ). In this study, using a reward-guided decision-making task with anti-correlated action-outcome contingencies that abruptly change throughout the experiment, we hypothesized that subjects would infer and incorporate this latent feature of the task structure in decision-making and integrate both actual and fictive outcomes into their decisions. Based on the recent reports showing superior model-fitting performance of these \u201cdouble-update\u201d (DU) learning models ( ,  ,  ), we hypothesized that the DU model would fit to the behavioral data better than the standard RL models that only update the value of the selected action. Previous reports with subsets of our subjects ( ,  ) used the basic RL model to test their hypotheses related to the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity in the ventral striatum (VS) that varies with PEs, which has been shown to be reliably predicted by this model ( ). Alternatively, our approach was to compare various learning models with different assumptions about the amount of task-related information subjects may have extracted during the experiment. Our aim was to find the model that best explains the underlying computations carried out by the subjects while adjusting their responses to abruptly changing reinforcement contingencies of the task. \n\nThe combination of RL modeling and fMRI holds promise for testing various hypotheses concerning the brain mechanisms responsible for computational processes in reward-based decision-making ( ). Recently, by adopting this \u201cmodel-based fMRI\u201d approach ( ), neural representations of learning have been compared between substance-dependent and control groups to gain insight into the cognitive rigidity of addictive behavior. Research to date has mainly focused on the striatal impairments in reward-based decision-making ( ,  ) because addictive drugs seem to \u201chijack\u201d the reward-related processes governed by striatal structures and evoke a pattern of behavior similar to those evoked by natural rewards ( ,  ). However, drugs also cause structural and functional changes in the PFC, especially in the DLPFC, which possibly contribute to the decline of cognitive control ( ,  ,  ,  ). Furthermore, reduced neural recruitment in the DLPFC has been extensively reported in various drug-dependent groups performing other tasks that require cognitive flexibility ( ,  ,  ,  ; see   for a review). Moreover, a previous study with a subgroup of our subjects reported abnormal signal propagation between VS and DLPFC, possibly leading to impairments in modifying and controlling behavior following reinforcement ( ). Based on these findings, and recent evidence on the involvement of DLPFC in PRLT ( ,  ,  ,  ), the focus of this study was to elaborate on DLPFC's contribution to the inability of ADP in making flexible decisions in response to the reversals of reward contingencies. We sought to capture the neural substrates of decision-making in the PFC via a model that assumes subjects infer the unobservable (latent) reward structure of the task, which is then used to choose actions that maximize reward attained. We hypothesized that the BOLD activity in the DLPFC of ADP failing to track the PE signal derived from this model would contribute to impaired behavioral adaptation in alcohol dependence. \n\nThere is growing evidence that the human brain has distinct neural mechanisms for processing rewards and punishments ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Furthermore, recent research suggests that these mechanisms may act differently in the case of substance use disorder ( ,  ,  ). The mechanisms responsible for processing punishments may be of particular interest in understanding maladaptive decision-making in alcohol use disorder because aversive consequences of alcohol use seem to be often consciously acknowledged but behaviorally ignored by abusers. Previous studies using behavioral modeling showed that the actions of substance-dependent individuals usually fail to match with the punishment expectancies attached to them ( ,  ,  ,  ). Therefore, we hypothesized that punishments received in the current experiment would have weaker effects on the decisions of ADP compared to the decisions of HC. Negative PEs play a pivotal role in the current task as they mediate the extinction of learned actions that no longer lead to a reward when reinforcement contingencies change. In alcohol dependence, abnormal representation of these signals may contribute to the difficulties in ceasing drug-related behavior hindering the maintenance of abstinence. Therefore, one of the aims of the present study was to investigate the neural correlates of abnormal encoding of negative PEs. It has been shown that the severity of dependence symptoms ( ) and craving for alcohol ( ) are significantly related to the ability of an alcohol-dependent individual to stay abstinent in high-risk relapse situations in which the individual should override the action \u201cto consume\u201d alcohol. Therefore, we reasoned that impaired negative PE signaling in ADP would be related to high dependence severity and high craving for alcohol. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \n34 abstinent ADP and 26 HC (all male) participated in the current study (see   for sample characteristics). Subjects had no other neurological or psychiatric disorder and no current drug abuse other than nicotine. All ADP were diagnosed according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th edition ( ) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition ( ). The severity of dependence and the mean craving for alcohol were assessed with the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS,  ) and the average craving subscale of Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) ( ). The amount of alcohol intake in the past year was evaluated with the Lifetime Drinking History (LDH) questionnaire ( ). The smoking severity of the subjects was also assessed with the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence ( ). During fMRI sessions, ADP had been abstinent and were free of benzodiazepine or chlormethiazole medication for at least 1\u00a0week (>\u00a04 half-lives). Groups did not differ on age, handedness ( ) or verbal intelligence as assessed with a German vocabulary test ( ). However, there were significantly more chronic cigarette smokers in ADP than HC. All statistical analyses (including the fMRI analyses) were therefore controlled for smoking status.   \nSample characteristics.

On each trial, subjects had to choose one of the two abstract visual stimuli presented on a computer screen for 2\u00a0s. Following the action, the selected stimulus and its outcome\u2014either a green smiley for reward or a red frowny for punishment\u2014stayed on the screen for 1\u00a0s. The experiment included two runs of 100 trials separated by a short break. Trial timings were jittered by an interval of 1\u20136.5\u00a0s. \n\nThere were three block types with the following reward contingencies: 20% left- and 80% right-, (2) 80% left- and 20% right-, and (3) 50% left- and 50% right-hand choices leading to a reward, otherwise to a punishment. Reward contingencies on the two options were fully anti-correlated, so that, for instance, when one option resulted in a reward on 80% of occasions, the other option led to a punishment 80% of the time. Subjects started the experiment with either the block type (1) or (2). Block type shifted abruptly and unpredictably to any of the randomly chosen block types after ten trials (minimum block length) when subjects chose the most highly rewarding option on 70% (50% for the 3rd block type) of the trials of an entire block. Regardless of whether this learning criterion was fulfilled, reward contingencies automatically changed after the maximum block length of 16 trials. \n\nSubjects were instructed that the aim of the task was to learn by trial and error which of the two stimuli is better than the other, i.e. has a higher chance of winning. They were asked to adapt their behavior to possible changes in reward contingencies and win as often as possible. However, they were not informed about the exact timing of contingency changes or the reward probabilities (see Supplementary material for task instructions). Before entering the fMRI scanner, subjects were asked to perform a short version without the changes in reward contingencies to become familiar with the probabilistic nature of the task. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis of the behavior \n  \nThe total number of correct choices and the number of blocks for which the reversal criterion was met were compared between the two groups using two-sample   t  -tests. Response times after rewards and punishments were compared using a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 ANCOVA, with a between-subject factor   group  , a within-subject factor   outcome valence  , and a covariate for smoking status. We also measured the extent to which the outcome information gathered by the subjects during the previous four trials was integrated into the decisions to stay on the same option (win-stay behavior) or shift to the other option (lose-shift behavior). We then tested for between-group differences in win-stay and lose-shift behavior, which were assessed by a logistic regression analysis as explained elsewhere ( ) and in the Supplementary material. \n\nAll standard tests in this study were performed in R 3.0.2 ( ). Greenhouse\u2013Geiser correction was used whenever the sphericity assumption was violated. \n\n\n### Computational modeling of the behavioral data \n  \n#### Models \n  \nWe adopted a behavioral modeling approach to understand the computational processes underlying the reward-based decisions of the subjects and to explore the differences between ADP and HC in these processes. We considered three groups of computational learning models with different assumptions about the amount of task-related information subjects may have inferred during the experiment ( ). The first group of learning models consisted of the standard Rescorla-Wagner type models ( ) in which learning is based on an error measure called \u201cprediction error\u201d. Learning takes place as the PE (denoted as   \u03b4   in Eq.  ), which quantifies the discrepancy between the received outcome   R   and the expected outcome   Q  (  a  ), updates the expected value   Q  (  a  ) of the selected action at the end of each trial when   R   information is revealed (Eqs.  ,  ). It reinforces an action or facilitates its extinction depending on whether the obtained   R   is better (positive PE) or worse (negative PE) than the expected outcome   Q  (  a  ). \n\nThe effect of the reinforcement on subject's decision is represented by a free parameter called reinforcement sensitivity, as denoted by   \u03c1   in Eq.  . Higher values of   \u03c1   magnify the differences between the option values and increase the probability of the selection of the action with higher expected value. On the other hand, lower values lead to explorative decisions that are inconsistent and independent of the reward expectancies ( ). This definition of sensitivity should be distinguished from the more traditional definition as the ability to derive pleasure or displeasure from the reinforcers in the experiment. \n\nThe extent to which PE updates the expected value is determined by another free parameter called learning rate   \u03b1   (Eq.  ). To study the dependence-related behavioral patterns that are specific to processing reward and punishment, we allowed the reinforcement sensitivity parameter to take two distinct values, reward sensitivity (  \u03c1  ) or punishment sensitivity (  \u03c1  ), according to the valence of outcome ( ,  ). Learning rate was also allowed to take two different values depending on whether the received outcome   R   is a reward (reward learning rate   \u03b1  ) or a punishment (punishment learning rate   \u03b1  ). \n\nThe first group of learning models tested in this study assumes that learning can only take place through experience. Therefore, they only update the expected value of the selected action   Q  (  a  ), while leaving the expected value of the unselected action   Q  (  a  \u2032) unchanged (Eq.  ) (hence called \u201csingle-update\u201d models). The second class of models, called \u201cdouble-update\u201d models, extend the single update (SU) models by also taking into account the counterfactual outcome that could have been received from the unselected action ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Based on the idea that subjects infer and utilize the knowledge that reward contingencies on two options are fully anti-correlated, double update (DU) models update the expected values of both the selected action   a   (Eq.  ) and the unselected action   a  \u2032 (Eq.  ). It is important to note that after receiving a reward, the update rule for the unchosen option does not assume a certain punishment (or vice versa); but a lower probability of receiving reward, therefore a higher probability of receiving punishment as there is no other type of feedback in the experiment. \n\nWe generated three versions of SU and DU models with different combinations of free parameters (SU1\u20133, DU1\u20133, see  ). Additionally, with an additional DU model (DU4), we tested the hypothesis that fictive learning signals would not be utilized in updating of the action values as effectively as actual learning signals ( ). This model uses a fictive learning rate parameter, which is calculated by weighting the learning rate with an additional parameter   \u03be  . This parameter is a fractional step size, which takes a value between 0 and 1 (Eq.  ).   \nComputational learning models. Single-update (SU), double-update (DU) models, and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) use various combinations of free parameters. The potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) values inform about the convergence of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The minimum deviance information criterion (DIC) value (written in bold) designates the most parsimonious model. DIC values are reported for all behavioral data including (DIC ) and excluding the poorly-fitted subjects (DIC ).   \u03b1  : learning rate, \u03c1: reinforcement sensitivity,   \u03be  : fictive weight, \u03c4: transition probability,   \u03c6  : outcome probability. The parameters, which take different values according to the valence of the outcome, are marked with subscripts r for reward and p for punishment. \n  Table 2   \n\nIn all of the SU and DU models, action probabilities   p  (  a  ) were calculated from the expected reward values of the options using the following action selection rule, where \u03c3(z)\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0/\u00a0(1\u00a0+\u00a0exp(\u2212\u00a0z)) is the sigmoid function. The noise temperature parameter   \u03b2   in Eq.   controls the level of stochasticity in action selection. Adjusting the reward and punishment sensitivity parameters in SU and DU models is an alternative way to modify   \u03b2  , which was therefore set to 1 to avoid overparameterization. The indecision point   c   in Eq.   determines the point on the sigmoid function at which both choices are equally likely to be selected. No bias was found in the choices when reward values of options were equal (paired-sample   t  -test, t \u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.944, p\u00a0=\u00a00.348). Hence,   c   was fixed to 0. \n\nThe third group of learning models implemented in this study was Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which assume that subjects construct a state-based representation of the task via probabilities that determine contingency changes and the outcome that would arise from selecting an action ( ,  ). HMMs assign a prior belief probability to each action   b  (  a  ), which indicates the subjective belief that an action   a   is correct, i.e. associated with the higher reward contingency. At the end of each trial upon each new outcome, prior probabilities are updated to a posterior belief probability via Bayes' rule ( ) (see the Supplementary material for the implementation details of HMM). An important feature of HMM is that updating of the posterior belief probabilities does not involve computations of PEs. In contrast to SU and DU models, HMM uses the outcome information as an evidence to simultaneously update the belief probabilities of all possible actions. The amount of change in the prior belief made by an outcome is called \u201cBayesian surprise\u201d ( ), which can only be computed after belief updating. On the other hand, PEs in RL models are calculated at the time of the outcome presentation and directly used in learning ( ). \n\nHMM captures the reversal nature of the task with a free parameter called transition probability (  \u03c4  ), which governs the transitions among the belief states. The probability with which an outcome can be obtained in a particular belief state is represented by a free parameter called outcome probability (  \u03c6  ). Analogous to the distinct reward and punishment sensitivities defined in the SU and DU models, the outcome probability parameter was also allowed to take two different values according to the valence of the outcome. Reward probability (  \u03c6  ) represents the likelihood of getting a reward given that subject is in a correct belief state; whereas punishment probability (  \u03c6  ) accounts for receiving a punishment given that subject is in an incorrect belief state. We tested two versions of the HMM. The first version assumes that the chance of getting a reward from a \u2018correct\u2019 belief state equals to the chance of receiving a punishment from an \u2018incorrect\u2019 belief state. The second version allows outcome probabilities to take different values according to the valence of the outcome (see HMM1 and HMM2 in  ). \n\n\n#### Model fitting and model comparison \n  \nIndividual and group parameters were simultaneously estimated in terms of probability distributions using a hierarchical Bayesian inference method. We adopted this method because it provides a principled approach for tackling optimization problems such as numerical stability and estimations at parameter boundaries, which often occur in the modeling of choice data ( ,  ,  ). \n\nA Bayesian graphical model was created for each candidate learning model in JAGS ( ). A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm called Gibbs sampling was used to sample from the parameter distributions of the models. Three chains of 100,000 samples were generated. To reduce autocorrelation between the MCMC samples, only every 5th sample was retained. The first 5000 samples from each chain were discarded for burn-in, leaving 19,000 samples per chain. Group prior distributions were only weakly informed to keep the estimated parameters in a reasonable range [Uniform(0,1) for learning rate, fictive weight parameter and all parameters of the HMMs; Uniform(0,20) for reward and punishment sensitivities]. To assure convergence, MCMC chains were visually analyzed for each parameter whether they stabilized at the same region of the sample space ( ,  ). We also calculated the Gelman-Rubin convergence and reported the potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) of each model ( ). \n\nFor selecting the best-fitting model, we calculated the model scores in deviance information criterion (DIC) ( , see Supplementary material for details). The model with the smallest value was selected as the best-fitting model. Furthermore, to assess the level of improvement provided by the best-fitting model over the null model in predicting subject's choices, we calculated the pseudo-R  values for each subject, as described elsewhere ( ,  ), using the posterior means of individual parameter distributions. We used pseudo-R  values to single out the subjects whose behavior could not be predicted by the best-fitting model significantly better than near chance level. Based on our previous reports ( ), the threshold for near chance level was set to p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.55 which corresponds to pseudo-R \u00a0\u2264\u00a00.1375. This threshold value was selected to make sure that our results were not confounded by poor model fits because we believe that the behavioral data of the subjects whose model-fits are close to chance level should also be treated with caution due to the probabilistic nature of model fitting. Although not reported in this article because of space limitations, we also used two other threshold values, 0.50 and 0.52, to confirm that our results were not sensitive to the selected specific threshold value. \n\nAfter exclusion of these poorly-fitted subjects, we performed the model selection analysis once more to confirm that the results were not confounded by poor model fit. Model comparison was also applied separately to the choice data of HC and ADP. \n\n\n#### Comparison of the model parameters between the two groups \n  \nFor each model parameter, we computed the differences between the samples of the two groups (HC\u00a0>\u00a0ADP) at each step of the MCMC chains. We then plotted these sample differences in a histogram. The null hypothesis (H ) was rejected when the value zero\u2014indicating no significant group difference\u2014fell outside the 95% high-density interval (HDI) which spanned 95% of the histograms ( ). \n\nWe also examined the relationship between the parameters of the best-fitting model and clinical questionnaire scores. We used the scores on the ADS, average craving subscale of the OCDS, and the LDH to divide ADP into two subgroups at the median values. In the first analysis, we estimated and compared the model parameters of the \u201cseverely affected\u201d (18 subjects, ADS: 15\u201336\u00a0\u2265\u00a015) and the \u201cless severe\u201d (16 subjects, ADS: 1\u201314\u00a0<\u00a015) ADP. We used the same parameter comparison technique described above. Similarly, we categorized ADP into \u201chigh craving\u201d (19 ADP, OCDS : 10\u2013100\u00a0\u2265\u00a010) and \u201clow craving\u201d (15 subjects, OCDS : 0\u20135\u00a0<\u00a010) groups using the median score on the OCDS . Finally, taking the same approach, we compared the group parameters of the \u201chigh consumers\u201d (17 ADP, 58.56\u2013999\u00a0l\u00a0\u2265\u00a057\u00a0l) and the \u201clow consumers\u201d (17 ADP, 2.10\u201355.44\u00a0l\u00a0<\u00a057\u00a0l), which were specified according to the median score on the LDH questionnaire. We also verified the results by testing the correlation between the posterior means of individual parameter distributions of ADP and their clinical scores. \n\n\n#### Learning curves \n  \nLearning curve visualizes the adaptation of choice behavior to the reversals of reinforcement contingencies. Average learning curves of HC, ADP, and the poorly-fitted subjects were constructed by plotting the mean correct responses as a function of trial number. Choosing the stimulus with higher reward probability was considered as a correct response. The number of trials was limited to ten because blocks consisted of a minimum number of ten trials. We performed a 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 ANCOVA to compare the learning curves of the groups. The mean correct responses of the subjects at each trial after contingency reversals were defined as the dependent variable. The between-subjects factor   group   had three levels for HC, ADP, and the poorly-fitted subjects; whereas the within-subjects factor   trial   had ten levels for each trial after the reversals. Smoking status was included as a nuisance variable. \n\nA successful learning model should capture and replicate the characteristics of behavioral data. To test if the best-fitting learning model fulfilled this criterion, we examined whether surrogate learning curves matched the actual learning curves of the subjects. Surrogate learning curves were constructed by plotting the mean performance of simulated data generated by letting the best-fitting model with parameters fitted to the individual subjects perform the task 100 times. Poorly-fitted data were excluded from this analysis. Surrogate data were then compared using a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0trial ANCOVA. \n\n\n\n### FMRI data acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nImaging was performed using a 3\u00a0Tesla GE Signa scanner with a T2*-weighted sequence (29 slices with 4\u00a0mm thickness; repetition time, 2.3\u00a0s; echo time, 27\u00a0ms; flip, 90\u00b0; matrix size, 128\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0128; field of view, 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256\u00a0mm ; in-plane voxel resolution of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0mm ) and a T1-weighted structural scan (repetition time, 7.8\u00a0ms; echo time, 3.2\u00a0ms; flip, 20\u00b0; matrix size 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256; 1\u00a0mm slice thickness; voxel size of 1\u00a0mm ). \n\nFunctional imaging data were analyzed using SPM8 ( ). The first three volumes of each session were discarded. Volumes were corrected for the delay of slice time acquisition and motion. They were spatially normalized into MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space and were spatially filtered with a Gaussian kernel (8\u00a0mm full width at half maximum). Imaging data of 6 subjects (3 ADP due to motion artifacts and 3 HC due to susceptibility artifacts) were discarded. The region of interest (ROI) analyses were performed using the Marsbar toolbox in SPM ( ). \n\n\n### FMRI data analysis \n  \nFMRI data were analyzed in an event-related manner using a general linear model approach with two levels. At the first level, reward and punishment events were modeled by stick functions at the onset of the outcome. Trial-by-trial PE time-series were computed using the best-fitting learning model. Similar to outcome events, PE signals were also grouped into positive and negative PEs and included in the GLM as parametric modulators for reward and punishment conditions. Trials without a response were modeled separately. All regressors were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function as provided by SPM. The movement parameters from the realignment process were included as regressors of no interest. \n\n#### Reward and punishment representations in the brain \n  \n\u201cReward vs. punishment\u201d and \u201cpunishment vs. reward\u201d contrast images were generated for each subject and taken to the second level. For each contrast image, we performed a random-effects group-level analysis with a one-sample   t  -test across the entire sample. We also compared groups with a two-sample   t  -test. FMRI results were reported as significant at p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05 family wise error (FWE) whole-brain corrected at the voxel level. \n\n\n#### Neural correlates of the reward and punishment sensitivities \n  \nTo investigate how reinforcement sensitivity parameters estimated in behavioral modeling were correlated with reward- and punishment-related BOLD responses across all subjects, we used two independent linear regression models at the second level of the fMRI analysis. The first regression model included the \u201creward vs. punishment\u201d contrast images as the dependent variable and the reward sensitivities of the subjects as the covariate of interest. Likewise, the second regression model included the \u201cpunishment vs. reward\u201d contrast images as the dependent variable, and the punishment sensitivities of the subjects as the covariate of interest. Results were reported significant at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 SVC within the brain regions, which showed significant \u201creward vs. punishment\u201d activity (for reward sensitivity), or \u201cpunishment vs. reward\u201d activity (for punishment sensitivity) across all subjects at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE whole brain corrected. \n\n\n#### Neural correlates of prediction errors \n  \nWe performed a parametric model-based fMRI analysis to examine the differences between HC and ADP in the neural correlates of PEs. PEs were calculated using the mean values of the posterior parameter distributions estimated for each individual. Single subject contrast images of the parametric modulators positive PE ([+]PE) and negative PE ([\u2212]PE) were taken to a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 repeated measures ANOVA (flexible factorial design in SPM) with a between-subjects factor   group   (HC vs. ADP) and a within-subjects factor   PE type   (positive vs. negative).   Subjects   factor in SPM was also included to model subject constants. We tested the following contrasts: (1) the PE-related activity across all subjects, (2) between-group difference in the PE-related activity, (3) between-group difference in the [+]PE-related activity, (4) between-group difference in the [\u2212]PE-related activity. FMRI results were reported as significant at p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05 FWE whole-brain corrected at the voxel level. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Statistical analysis of the behavior \n  \nADP met the learning criterion (70% correct responses during a maximum block length of 16 trials) less often than HC (t \u00a0=\u00a01.99, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05;   M  \u00a0=\u00a011.15,   SD  \u00a0=\u00a03.86;   M  \u00a0=\u00a09.176,   SD  \u00a0=\u00a03.76), completing the task with a significantly lower number of correct choices (t \u00a0=\u00a02.586, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012,   M  \u00a0=\u00a0136.15,   SD  \u00a0=\u00a06.14;   M  \u00a0=\u00a0131.35,   SD  \u00a0=\u00a07.78). A 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02   group  \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0  outcome valence   ANCOVA with response times as the dependent variable showed no significant main effect of   group   (F(1,58)\u00a0=\u00a00.002, p\u00a0=\u00a00.960) or   outcome valence   (F(1,58)\u00a0=\u00a02.986, p\u00a0=\u00a00.089); or a significant   group  \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0  outcome valence   interaction (F(1,58)\u00a0=\u00a01.031, p\u00a0=\u00a00.314). \n\nWe also tested for between-group differences in win-stay and lose-shift behavior. A logistic regression analysis estimated the beta parameters of the four win-stay regressors and the four lose-shift regressors. These regressors model the extent to which subjects integrated the outcome information from the previous four trials (lag) into their decisions to stay on the same option or shift to the other option. The first 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04   group  \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0  lag   ANOVA with the parameter estimates of win-stay regressors revealed no significant difference between the groups (F(1, 58)\u00a0=\u00a01.479, p\u00a0=\u00a00.229, see ( A); however the main effect of the factor   lag   was found significant (F(3, 174)\u00a0=\u00a07.679, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). No significant interaction effect was found between the factors   group   and   lag   (F(3, 174)\u00a0=\u00a00.629, p\u00a0=\u00a00.597). The second 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04 ANOVA with the parameter estimates of the four lose-shift regressors indicated a significant difference between HC and ADP in lose-shift behavior (F(1, 58)\u00a0=\u00a05.971, p\u00a0=\u00a00.017, see  B). The main effect of the factor   lag   (F(3, 174)\u00a0=\u00a02.694, p\u00a0<\u00a00.047), as well as the interaction effect between the factors   group   and   lag   (F(3, 174)\u00a0=\u00a00.966, p\u00a0=\u00a00.410) were found insignificant.   \nWin-stay/lose-shift analysis.

The model comparison analysis based on the DIC scores of the models showed that compared to the SU models, the DU models and HMMs provided superior fits to behavioral data, supporting the assumption that subjects inferred and utilized the knowledge that reward contingencies on two options are fully anti-correlated. The DU2 model (the DU model with equal reward and punishment learning rates, but distinct reward and punishment sensitivities) was selected as the best model as it fitted the behavioral data of all subjects better than the other candidate models ( A and  ). The DU5 model was another candidate model with a similar DIC score. However, this model can easily be reduced to the DU2 model, because the estimated fictive weight parameter was found to be approximately equal to 1 (equal learning rates for actual and fictive outcomes).   \nModel comparison. (A) The DIC scores of the candidate learning models for all subjects. The most parsimonious model, the DU2 model (plotted with a patterned bar) has the lowest DIC score. (B) The pseudo-R  values of the subjects show the relative improvement in model-fitting provided by the DU2 model over the null model. The DU2 model was not able to predict the behavioral data of 11 subjects (5 HC and 6 ADP; marked by asterisks) better than near chance level which is marked with a horizontal dotted line at the pseudo-R \u00a0=\u00a00.1375 (corresponding to p\u00a0=\u00a00.55). (C) The DIC scores of the candidate learning models for all subjects fitted above the near chance level.   \u03b1  : learning rate,   \u03c1  : reinforcement sensitivity,   \u03be  : fictive weight, \u03c4: transition probability,   \u03c6  : outcome probability. Parameters, which take different values according to the valence of the outcome, are marked with subscripts r for reward and p for punishment. \n  Fig. 2   \n\nThe pseudo-R  values computed for each subject revealed that the DU2 model was not able to predict the behavioral data of 5 HC and 6 ADP better than near chance level ( B). To make sure that these poorly-fitted data did not confound the model comparison results, we repeated the model selection analysis for the well-fitted subjects only. We found that the DU2 model once again explained the behavioral data significantly better than the other models ( C and  ). None of the candidate models were able to predict the behavioral data of the poorly-fitted subjects better than near chance level. \n\nAdditionally, when we repeated the analysis separately for each subject group, the DU2 model provided a parsimonious fit for HC; whereas, when only ADP were considered, the HMM2 provided a slightly better fit than the DU2 model (see Supplementary Fig. 1). HMM requires the complete model of the environment, which may be seen as a strong assumption about learning given the fact that subjects were not given the chance to practice the task beforehand (orientation version did not involve reversals). On the other hand, DU model can handle the stochastic transitions and rewards of this task without constructing the model of the environment. As a matter of fact, a comparison of the surrogate learning curves generated by these models revealed that both of these models were able to predict the behavioral data of both groups statistically alike (see Supplementary material for a comparative analysis). This similarity is also consistent with the recent studies which did not perform any model comparison analysis and used the DU model based on the assumption that this model provides a good approximation of the HMM for this task design while being more parsimonious ( ,  ). \n\nAlso, our model selection was motivated by our study's hypotheses. In this study, we were particularly interested in addiction-related changes in reward-based learning guided by PEs. However, learning in HMMs do not involve computations of PE signals. Therefore, we selected the DU2 model as the best fitting model for all subjects and used this model to derive the PEs for the subsequent model-based fMRI analysis. \n\n\n#### Comparison of the model parameters between the two groups \n  \nThe posterior group parameter distributions of HC and ADP (see  ) were approximated using the DU2 model with converged MCMC samples (PSRF\u00a0=\u00a01.04, see  ). For each parameter of the DU2 model, parameter comparison between HC and ADP was performed by computing the differences between the samples of the two groups (HC\u00a0>\u00a0ADP) and plotting these differences as histograms ( A). The null hypothesis   H   of \u201cno group difference (HC\u00a0\u2212\u00a0ADP\u00a0=\u00a00)\u201d was rejected only for the punishment sensitivity parameter, as the value zero fell outside the 95% HDI (0.09\u20131.35) of the histogram. The positive value of the mean difference (HC\u00a0\u2212\u00a0ADP\u00a0=\u00a00.705) indicates that ADP had significantly lower punishment sensitivities compared to HC. The result remained unchanged when the analysis was repeated only for the well-fitted subjects (mean difference\u00a0=\u00a00.906, 95% HDI\u00a0=\u00a00.24\u20131.58). On the other hand, neither the learning rates, nor the reward sensitivities showed differences between groups (learning rate: mean difference\u00a0=\u00a00.003, 95% HDI\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.14\u20130.15; reward sensitivity: mean difference\u00a0=\u00a00.265, 95% HDI\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.61\u20131.17).   \nHistograms of parameter differences. A. Between-group comparisons in DU2 model parameters indicate lower punishment sensitivity in ADP. B. Parameter comparison between less severe (LO) and severely affected (HI) ADP indicate greater reward sensitivity in severely affected ADP. Mean values of the histograms are shown with solid black lines. The point of no group difference is marked with a red dashed line. 95% of the distributions are found within arrows.

N: sample size,   \u03b1  : learning rate,   \u03c1  : reward sensitivity,   \u03c1  : punishment sensitivity. \n  Table 3   \n\nTo examine the relationship between the parameters of the DU2 model and the clinical questionnaire scores, we ran additional model fitting analyses within ADP. First, we sought to determine whether the severity of alcohol dependence (assessed with ADS) was related to the parameters of the DU2 model. The posterior parameter distributions of the less severe (LO) and the severely affected (HI) ADP were approximated using MCMC samples. Difference distributions, which were computed by subtracting the parameter distributions of the severely affected ADP from those of the less severe ADP, were plotted as difference histograms ( B). Reward sensitivity parameter was found significantly different between these subgroups as the value zero indicating no difference was outside the 95% HDI (\u2212\u00a02.31\u00a0\u2212\u00a0[\u2212\u00a00.147]) of the histogram. The negative mean difference (severely affected\u00a0\u2212\u00a0less severe\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.21) indicated that the severely affected ADP had significantly higher reward sensitivities relative to the less severe ADP (M \u00a0=\u00a01.419, SD \u00a0=\u00a00.828; M \u00a0=\u00a02.633, SD \u00a0=\u00a01.672). Also, a significant positive correlation was found between the posterior means of individual reward sensitivity distributions of ADP and their ADS scores (Pearson's r\u00a0=\u00a00.482, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). \n\nThere was no significant difference between the low craving and the high craving ADP; or between the low consumers and the high consumers. \n\n\n#### Learning curves \n  \nWe constructed the average learning curves of HC, ADP, and the poorly-fitted subjects by plotting the mean correct responses as a function of trial number (bold curves in  ). Learning curves were then compared using a 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010   group  \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0  trial   ANCOVA, which showed a significant main effect of   group   (F(2, 57)\u00a0=\u00a06.27, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), a significant main effect of   trial   (F(3.90, 222.64)\u00a0=\u00a046.46, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Greenhouse\u2013Geiser corrected) and a significant   group  \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0  trial   interaction (F(7.81, 222.64)\u00a0=\u00a06.351, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Greenhouse\u2013Geiser corrected). When the analysis was repeated for the well-fitted HC and ADP only, the main effect of   group   (F(1, 47)\u00a0=\u00a05.378, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and   trial   remained significant (F(3.21, 151.01)\u00a0=\u00a082.707, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Greenhouse\u2013Geiser corrected); whereas the significant   group  \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0  trial   interaction effect disappeared (F(3.21, 151.01)\u00a0=\u00a01.042, p\u00a0=\u00a00.404, Greenhouse\u2013Geiser corrected). Post hoc two-sample   t  -tests revealed a significant difference between the mean correct responses of HC and ADP at the 5th trial after reversal, at which both groups reached their highest performance (t \u00a0=\u00a02.894, p\u00a0=\u00a00.028, Holm\u2013Bonferroni corrected,   M  \u00a0=\u00a092.09%,   SD  \u00a0=\u00a09.27%;   M  \u00a0=\u00a081.53%,   SD  \u00a0=\u00a014.64%).   \nLearning curves of HC, ADP, and poorly-fitted subjects. Correct responses (selection of the stimulus with higher reward probability) were averaged over blocks of 10 trials for actual (solid lines) and simulated data (dashed lines). Individually estimated parameters of the DU2 model were used for simulations. Shaded regions denote standard errors. \n  Fig. 4   \n\nNext, we tested whether surrogate learning curves generated by the DU2 model followed the actual learning curves of the subjects. Specifically, we were interested whether the difference in the punishment sensitivities of the DU2 model (when fitted to the ADP and HC) translated into the difference in learning curves. First, we generated surrogate choice data. DU2 models with parameters fitted to the individual subjects performed the task (100 times per model). Second, we averaged the correct responses and constructed the surrogate learning curves for HC, ADP and poorly-fitted subjects (dashed curves in  ). Finally, we compared the surrogate learning curves using a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010   group  \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0  trial   ANCOVA. Poorly-fitted data, as well as the data recorded during blocks with L: 50%\u2013R: 50% reward contingencies, were excluded from this analysis. ANCOVA showed a significant main effect of   group   (F(1, 47)\u00a0=\u00a06.95, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011) and a significant main effect of   trial   (F(2.26, 106.59)\u00a0=\u00a0139.19, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Greenhouse\u2013Geiser corrected). The   group  \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0  trial   interaction was found to be insignificant (F(2.26, 106.59)\u00a0=\u00a01.81, p\u00a0=\u00a00.064). Post hoc   t  -tests revealed a significant group difference in the mean correct responses at the 4th trial after the reversal (t \u00a0=\u00a03.244, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, Holm\u2013Bonferroni corrected,   M  \u00a0=\u00a087.62%,   SD  \u00a0=\u00a07.99%;   M  \u00a0=\u00a078.37%,   SD  \u00a0=\u00a011.06%) in addition to the 5th trial after the reversal (t \u00a0=\u00a03.273, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, Holm\u2013Bonferroni corrected,   M  \u00a0=\u00a091.43%,   SD  \u00a0=\u00a05.88%;   M  \u00a0=\u00a083.18%,   SD  \u00a0=\u00a010.35%). Hence, replication of the between-group difference in learning curves using the simulated data confirmed the significant association found between the decrease in the punishment sensitivity and the impaired behavioral adaptation of ADP. \n\nLearning curve analysis was not affected by the selection of the near chance threshold as both values yielded comparable results. \n\n\n\n### FMRI analysis \n  \n#### Reward and punishment representations in the brain \n  \nAcross all subjects, compared to punishments, rewards elicited a significant BOLD response in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, the bilateral precuneus, and the medial orbitofrontal cortex. Additionally, the left middle/superior PFC and the right putamen displayed an increased activity for reward vs. punishment (see Supplementary Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table 1). On the other hand, a significant activation in response to punishments relative to rewards was observed bilaterally in the anterior insula/inferior PFC, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the pre-SMA (see Supplementary Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table 1). Two-sample   t  -tests revealed no significant between-group difference in the reward vs. punishment or punishment vs. reward activity (p\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.001 uncorrected). \n\n\n#### Neural correlates of the reward and punishment sensitivities \n  \nWe also sought to probe whether there are neural correlates of reward and punishment sensitivity parameters. A linear regression performed at the second level of the fMRI analysis, which examined the correlation between \u201cpunishment vs. reward\u201d activity and punishment sensitivity parameter, revealed a significant positive correlation across all subjects in the right insula/inferior PFC (MNI [x y z]\u00a0=\u00a0[32 21 5]; k\u00a0=\u00a011; t \u00a0=\u00a03.80; p \u00a0=\u00a00.024;  ). On the other hand, no significant correlation was found between \u201creward vs. punishment\u201d activity and reward sensitivity parameter (p\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.001 uncorrected).   \nNeural correlates of punishment sensitivity. The \u201cpunishment\u00a0>\u00a0reward\u201d activity in the right insula is positively correlated with punishment sensitivity parameter of the best-fitting learning model. A scatter plot of the log-transformed punishment sensitivities vs. the mean parameter estimates of the punishment-related activity in the R insula (circled area) is also shown. \n  Fig. 5   \n\n\n#### Neural correlates of prediction errors \n  \nAcross all subjects, neural correlations of model-derived PE were found bilaterally in the VS, the middle, superior and inferior prefrontal cortices, the ACC, the midbrain, the globus pallidi, the middle temporal lobules, as well as in the left insula, the left supramarginal gyrus, the right inferior parietal lobule, the right precuneus and the right cerebellum (see Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2). \n\nAmong these regions, the contrast HC\u00a0>\u00a0ADP showed a significant between-group difference in the PE-related activity in the bilateral DLPFC (right: MNI [x y z], [40 33 43], t \u00a0=\u00a05.831, p \u00a0=\u00a00.005; left: [\u2212\u00a041 18 53], t \u00a0=\u00a05.488, p \u00a0=\u00a00.014), the bilateral dorsal premotor areas (right: [25 8 63], t \u00a0=\u00a06.081, p \u00a0=\u00a00.002; left: [\u2212\u00a041 11 53], t \u00a0=\u00a05.23, p \u00a0=\u00a00.032), and the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) ([42 \u2212\u00a062 43], t \u00a0=\u00a06.112, p \u00a0=\u00a00.002) ( A and  ). Striatal activity related to PE did not differ between the two groups (p\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.001 uncorrected). Furthermore, the reverse contrast, ADP\u00a0>\u00a0HC showed no significant difference (p\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.001 uncorrected). In order to address the concern that group differences observed in the DLPFC might be confounded by the individual differences in the model-fits, we repeated the 2nd level analysis only for the well-fitted subjects. The differences between HC and ADP in the PE-related activity remained significant in the left and the right DLPFCs (left DLPFC: [\u2212\u00a023 6 43], t \u00a0=\u00a05.15, p \u00a0=\u00a00.05; right DLPFC: [35 38 23], t \u00a0=\u00a05.16, p \u00a0=\u00a00.05).   \nImpaired PE-related activity in ADP. Group differences (HC\u00a0>\u00a0ADP) in the neural correlations of (A) total prediction error (PE) (both positive and negative), (B) negative prediction error ([\u2212]PE), (C) positive prediction error ([+]PE). A threshold of p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 uncorrected with an extent threshold of 20 voxels is used for visualization (corresponds to   t  \u00a0>\u00a03.31). The color bar represents   t  -values. Bar plots show the beta estimates of the parametric modulators (D) [\u2212]PE and (E) [+]PE extracted from the peak coordinates [\u2212\u00a033 8 50] and [42 36 35] showing significant group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0PE type interaction effect.

PE was grouped into [+]PE and [\u2212]PE according to whether the obtained outcome is better ([+]PE) or worse ([\u2212]PE) than the expected outcome. The contrast \u201cHC\u00a0>\u00a0ADP\u201d showed a hemispheric asymmetry in the DLPFC activation for the between-group differences such that a significant decrease in the [\u2212]PE-related activity ([\u2212\u00a038 11 53], t \u00a0=\u00a05.298, p \u00a0=\u00a00.026) was observed in the left DLPFC ( B and  ). On the other hand, reduced [+]PE-related activity in ADP was found in the right DLPFC ([40 33 40], t \u00a0=\u00a05.218, p \u00a0=\u00a00.033) ( C and  ). \n\nThis unanticipated asymmetry in the DLPFC for negative and positive PEs prompted us to perform a post hoc ANOVA. The interaction effect between   group   and   PE type   was tested using the contrasts \u201c(HC vs. ADP)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0([\u2212]PE vs. [+]PE)\u201d and \u201c(HC vs. ADP)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0([+]PE vs. [\u2212]PE)\u201d. Results were reported as significant at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 FWE corrected for the multiple comparisons within a volume in Brodmann area 9 and 46 that shows significant PE-related activity across all subjects. The contrast \u201c(HC vs. ADP)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0([\u2212]PE vs. [+]PE)\u201d revealed a significant activation in the left DLPFC ([\u2212\u00a033 8 50], t \u00a0=\u00a03.459, p \u00a0=\u00a00.043,  D and  ); whereas the contrast \u201c(HC vs. ADP)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0([+]PE vs. [\u2212]PE)\u201d showed a significant activation in the right DLPFC ([42 36 35], t \u00a0=\u00a04.359, p \u00a0=\u00a00.016,  D and  ).   \nGroup\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0type of the prediction error (PE) interaction effects in the left and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices.

We extracted the mean parameter estimates (beta estimates) of the [\u2212]PE- and [+]PE-related activities from the clusters showing significant group differences (cluster centers at [\u2212\u00a038 11 53] and [40 33 40]). We found that [\u2212]PE-related activity in the left DLPFC is significantly correlated with ADS scores of ADP (Pearson's r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.347, p\u00a0=\u00a00.032). This result remained significant when the poorly-fitted ADP were excluded from the analysis (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.494, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). No correlation was found between the [\u2212]PE-related activity difference in the left DLPFC and OCDS  scores (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.001, p\u00a0=\u00a00.498). Additionally, we found that [+]PE-related activity were correlated neither with ADS (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.022, p\u00a0=\u00a00.454), nor with OCDS  scores (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.079, p\u00a0=\u00a00.346). None of the other subscales or the total score of OCDS were correlated with the PE-related activity in the DLPFC. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, by using a reward-guided decision-making task and a so-called \u201cdouble-update\u201d RL model, we report a relation in alcohol dependence between impaired adaptation to the changes in reinforcement contingencies and decreased sensitivity to punishments. We also report a reduced correlation between the PEs derived from this DU model and the BOLD activity in the DLPFC of ADP. Moreover, we report an association between the severity of alcohol dependence and the decrease in the DLPFC activity related to negative PE signals, which play a critical role in adaptation to contingency changes by mediating the extinction of the behavior that is no longer associated with reward. \n\nADP had difficulty adapting their responses to the changing reward contingencies of the reward-guided decision-making task, a finding consistent with the results of the previous studies with subsets of our sample (13 ADP and 14 HC in  ; 20 ADP and 16 HC  ). Statistical analysis of win-stay and lose-shift behavior revealed that this adaptation difficulty was related to the weakened influence of punishments on decisions to shift the response. To understand the underlying computational mechanisms of this impairment, we modeled the choice behavior of our subjects using computational learning models with different assumptions about the amount of task-related information subjects may have inferred during the experiment. In line with our expectations, we found that the DU model achieved the highest accuracy in predicting the choices of all subjects. Between-group comparisons of the free parameters of this best-fitting model revealed that ADP had significantly lower punishment sensitivity. This finding is congruent with our hypothesis and the previous reports on reduced loss sensitivity and lower decision consistency in drug abuse ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). A computer simulation of behavioral data using the fitted parameters of the DU model reproduced the maladaptive behavior of ADP, further verifying the association between decreased punishment sensitivity and impaired behavioral adaptation. On the other hand, no significant group difference was found in other parameters of the DU model, i.e. learning rate and reward sensitivity. We argue that the difference observed between HC and ADP in adapting to changes in contingencies may not be related to learning speed or implemented learning strategy. Slower adaptation to reversals may rather be due to the fact that ADP's choices just after reversals (when subjects receive the majority of consecutive punishments) were less affected by the action values. Therefore, our results suggest that when faced with punishment, decisions of ADP are more often replaced by random guesses, which are possibly reached in the absence of deliberation. Finally, when ADP were divided into two groups at the median ADS score, we found that relative to the \u201cless severe\u201d group, the \u201cseverely affected\u201d ADP had greater reward sensitivity, showing a behavioral pattern suggestive of increased tendency to respond actively to the stimuli leading to pursuit of rewards ( ). \n\nAcross all subjects, we discovered a positive correlation between the model-estimated punishment sensitivity and right anterior insula/inferior PFC activity in response to \u201cpunishment vs. reward\u201d. In previous neuroimaging studies featuring tasks with reversals, anterior insula, and inferior PFC responses have been shown to signal the decreases in the expected values of selected actions and predict the consecutive behavioral shifts ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Thus, our finding can be interpreted as evidence that the right anterior insula may be involved in the reduced ability of ADP to adjust choice behavior according to negative outcome experiences. As a part of the salient network, the anterior insula plays a crucial role in detecting salient events and engaging the central executive network for high-level cognitive control and attentional processing (see reviews by  ,  ). In our experiment, high performance partly depends on detecting the saliency of punishing stimuli, and channeling brain's top-down control resources via other cortical regions such as the DLPFC ( ). The significant correlation between punishment sensitivity and the activity in the right anterior insula therefore suggests that reduced punishment sensitivity in ADP can be related to a compromised detection of punishment events as being salient by the right anterior insula, which may fail to trigger appropriate cognitive control signals in alcohol dependence. However, it is pertinent to point out that punishment vs. reward activity in the right anterior insula/inferior PFC did not differ between HC and ADP despite the significant difference found in punishment sensitivity. The reason for this might be that the event-related fMRI analysis per se was not able to differentiate alterations in neural activity with respect to learning or decision-making in our patient group, which motivated us to combine model-derived PEs and the fMRI data in a model-based fMRI analysis. \n\nModel-based fMRI analysis revealed significantly lower PE-related activities in the bilateral DLPFC, the bilateral dorsal premotor areas, and the right IPS of ADP, indicating that these regions were less responsive to teaching signals that putatively facilitate behavioral adaptation. This result accords with our hypothesis that the DLPFC is implicated in the maladaptive reward-based decision-making of ADP given that the adaptive processes taking place in the PFC were captured by a computational learning model that incorporates task-related information into decisions. PEs, which form the basis for learning ( ), seem to evoke BOLD responses in the DLPFC of healthy subjects when they learned the associations between cues and affectively neutral outcomes in an associative learning task ( ). Furthermore, Fletcher et al. demonstrated that the DLPFC activity was also able to predict the subsequent decisions of these subjects. Indeed, the tendency for taking the corrective action upon receiving an error seems to get weakened by DLPFC damage ( ). Similarly, transient disruption of the DLPFC activity with transcranial magnetic stimulation impairs flexible decision-making in healthy individuals ( ). Therefore, it is possible to interpret the observed attenuation in the PE-related DLPFC activity as a decline in ADP in the selection of the corrective action in an environment requiring adaptive responses. \n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study with substance-dependent patients showing reduced PE-related activity in the DLPFC. Although the DLPFC has been regarded as an important neural substrate of maladaptive decision-making in substance dependence ( ,  ,  ,  ), a decrease in the neural tracking of PEs in this brain region has not yet been reported by other studies with substance-dependent subjects ( ,  ,  ,  ). The primary reason might be that the PEs used in our model-based fMRI analysis were derived from a model that was selected from a pool of candidate models according to its performance in predicting behavioral data. On the contrary, the previous studies cited above defined the standard Rescorla\u2013Wagner model a priori, based on their hypotheses related to the striatal PE-signaling, which has been shown to be reliably predicted by this model ( ). To confirm this interpretation, we repeated the model-based fMRI analysis with the PEs derived from the standard Rescorla\u2013Wagner (denoted as \u201cSU1\u201d in the model set). Consistent with these studies mentioned above, we also observed significant PE-related signals in the bilateral VS (see Supplementary material). However, the between-group difference we found in the PE-related DLPFC activity disappeared. It is probable that improvement provided by the DU model in explaining the computational processes underlying the choice behavior increased the model-based fMRI analysis's capability to capture the group differences in the neural correlates of these processes. Therefore, we conclude that selecting the learning model based on its performance on predicting behavioral data also improved the sensitivity of the subsequent model-based fMRI analysis. \n\nConsistent with two previous studies with subsets of our subjects ( ,  ), we found intact striatal PE signaling in ADP, which suggests that action selection in ADP is inadequately informed by otherwise properly computed reward-learning signals in the reward/valuation network. It has been suggested that DLPFC potentiates adaptive decisions by incorporating the reward expectancies into decision representations ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Consistent with this idea, simultaneous recordings from the caudate nucleus (a limbic brain structure known to encode PEs) and the lateral PFC of monkeys during a reversal learning task showed that in addition to encoding PE, the lateral PFC activity also predicts the forthcoming responses ( ). Therefore, intact striatal but reduced DLPFC activity correlated with PE suggests an ineffective integration of the reward-related information in the DLPFC of ADP which may result in selection of choices that are loosely coupled with the recently updated contingencies of the environment ( ,  ). \n\nAnother way to interpret our data is that motivational signals may not be effectively embedded into cognitive processing in alcohol dependence. For reward maximization, it has recently been proposed that cognitive control function interacts with motivation ( ). For instance, cognitive tasks offering monetary gains have shown that motivation can enhance executive processes to achieve efficient goal-directed behavior (e.g.  ). Experimental data suggest that this interplay between motivation and cognition requires robust interactions between the reward/valuation network and the fronto-parietal attentional network ( ,  ). In particular, the DLPFC in the latter network appears to bridge cognitive control and value-processing by representing both cognitive and motivational (value-based) information ( ). A previous report with a subset of our subject group demonstrated an abnormal functional connectivity between these two networks, specifically between the VS and the DLPFC ( ). Therefore, the reduced PE-related activity in the DLPFC of ADP, together with the findings of   suggest an impaired integration of motivational signals with executive control, with a possible consequence of a decrease in the engagement of cognitive control mechanisms in alcohol dependence. \n\nThe left DLPFC activity in ADP showed a decreased neural tracking of negative PEs, which, according to the RL theory, facilitate the extinction of a learned response ( ). This attenuated activity in the left DLPFC may contribute to the cognitive rigidity of ADP by delaying the extinction of the action that is no longer paired with a reward when reinforcement contingencies change. Diminished activity in the left DLPFC has also been demonstrated in ADP performing stop signal ( ) and Stroop tasks ( ), which involve extinction of \u201cold\u201d and reconfiguration of \u201cnew\u201d stimulus-response associations. Moreover, transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left but not the right DLPFC disrupted the cognitive flexibility of healthy participants ( ,  ). Here, it is important to note that the ranges of the negative PEs used in this study were determined by the punishment sensitivity parameter of the DU model estimated for each subject. Therefore, the reduced tracking of these signals suggests a neural substrate in the left DLPFC for the diminished influence of adverse consequences over the actions of ADP. An additional finding was that the right DLPFC of ADP showed a reduced tracking of positive PEs, which may reflect impairment in initiating actions to select the action that was formerly punishing and became rewarding after a contingency reversal. \n\nCorrelating the PE-related activations in the DLPFC with a severity index of alcohol dependence (Alcohol Dependency Scale, ADS) revealed that the diminished encoding of negative PEs in the left DLPFC was more prominent in ADP with high severity scores. This finding suggests that functional abnormalities in the left DLPFC may contribute to the difficulties severely affected ADP commonly experience in overriding drug-related behavior and maintaining abstinence. On the other hand, neither the PE-related activity in the DLPFC nor the PE-related activity in the VS of ADP was found to be correlated with the craving scores of ADP (as measured using OCDS ). This finding is discordant with   showing an association between the striatal PE signals and OCDS . This discrepancy, which may be due to sample-to-sample variation between these two studies or the methodological differences in behavioral modeling, needs to be clarified by future studies. \n\nOne limitation of this study was the magnetic susceptibility artifacts leading to the loss of signal intensity in the orbitofrontal cortex, as this region is located in the vicinity of the sinonasal areas. Future studies should tackle this problem with a more sensitive scanning method. Also, only male participants were recruited to avoid gender's confounding effects. Future studies with female subjects are of interest, as differences between gender groups in addictive behavior have been noted in several studies ( ,  ,  ). Finally, it is important to bear in mind that our correlational design limits causal inferences. Therefore, longitudinal studies are required to determine whether the alterations in the PE-related DLPFC activity reflect changes in cognitive flexibility due to alcohol dependence, or they result from preexisting vulnerabilities. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, our results may contribute to the elucidation of the behavioral mechanisms and their neural correlates involved in impaired decision-making in substance dependence. They may, in particular, help us to understand the cognitive processes underlying the difficulties in overriding previously rewarded, but currently punishing drug-related actions with non-drug-related ones. There is some evidence that computer-aided cognitive training can treat impaired cognitive processes; improving information processing, verbal and non-verbal memory, attention, and problem-solving ( ). Moreover, it has successfully been shown with alcohol-dependent individuals that cognitive training can support rehabilitation as part of the traditional treatment (e.g.  ,  ,  ). Therefore, it is possible that a focused training of adaptation to reversing reinforcement contingencies might be a valuable treatment module for improving clinical outcomes in alcohol dependence, especially in severe cases. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: t0005\n### Label: Table 1\nUnnamed: 0\tADP (34)\tHC (26)\tStatistics\tp\nAge\t44.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.27, 23\u201360\u00a0years\t41.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.59, 28\u201361\u00a0years\tt58\u00a0=\u00a01.21\t0.22\nSex\tAll male\tAll male\t\t\nSmoking\t25 smokers\t11 smokers\t\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a04.75\t0.02\nFTND\t5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.73, 1\u201310\t3.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.37, 0\u20137\tt34\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.71\t0.1\nEDI\tRight-handed\tRight-handed\t\t\nVerbal IQ\t102.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.92, 85\u2013125\t103.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.93, 90\u2013125\tt58\u00a0=\u00a00.41\t0.68\nLDH last year (kg)\t89.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0166.04, 2.10\u2013999\t5.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.27, 0.12\u201368.88\tt58\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.55\t0.01\nOCDS sum\t17.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.09, 4\u201333\t2.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.56, 0\u201311\tt58\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a07.51\t0.001\nOCDS craving\t8.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.06, 0\u201340\t28.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a035.60, 0\u2013100\tt58\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.78\t0.007\nADS\t15.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.73, 1\u201336\t\u2013\t\t\nDays of abstinence\t17.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.92, 7\u201346\u00a0days\t\u2013\t\t\n### Caption\nSample characteristics.

Thirty Cantonese\u2013Mandarin\u2013English trilingual speakers, who were highly proficient in Cantonese (L1) and Mandarin (L2), and moderately proficient in English (L3), performed a picture-naming task in three dual-language contexts (L1-L2, L2-L3, and L1-L3). After each of the three naming tasks, participants performed a flanker task, measuring contextual effects on the inhibitory control system. Behavioral results showed a typical flanker effect in the L2-L3 and L1-L3 condition, but not in the L1-L2 condition, which indicates contextual facilitation on inhibitory control performance by the L1-L2 context. Whole brain analysis of the fMRI data acquired during the flanker tasks showed more neural activations in the right prefrontal cortex and subcortical areas in the L2-L3 and L1-L3 condition on one hand as compared to the L1-L2 condition on the other hand, suggesting greater involvement of the cognitive control areas when participants were performing the flanker task in L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts. Effective connectivity analyses displayed a cortical-subcortical-cerebellar circuitry for inhibitory control in the trilinguals. However, contrary to the right-lateralized network in the L1-L2 condition, functional networks for inhibitory control in the L2-L3 and L1-L3 condition are less integrated and more left-lateralized. These findings provide a novel perspective for investigating the interaction between bilingualism (multilingualism) and inhibitory control by demonstrating instant behavioral effects and neural plasticity as a function of changes in global language contexts. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nBilingualism is a form of \u201cmental juggler\u201d ( ), as speaking one language often involves simultaneous access to the non-target language in the brain ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ). Therefore, for bilingual speakers, managing two languages requires constantly selecting words in the intended language and suppressing activations of the non-target language, a routine that necessitates the engagement of inhibitory control. As a result, the experience of using multiple languages might enhance bilinguals\u2019 performance in non-linguistic domains. Previous studies have shown that bilinguals are less distracted, as compared to monolinguals, when performing inhibitory control tasks, including the Simon task ( ;  ), the Stroop task ( ), and the flanker task ( ). Moreover, interpreting training has been shown to improve inhibitory control processes ( ). \n\nThe past decade has witnessed a dramatic increase in the use of neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural system of bilingual language control and the effects of second language acquisition on inhibitory control (e.g.,  ;  ;  ).   proposed a brain network for language control during bilingual speech production. The network includes the left prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), basal ganglia, and inferior parietal lobule.   hypothesis is that this neural network is dedicated to the selection and temporal sequencing of language representations during bilingual word production, and the pipeline works in the following order: The left basal-ganglia and ACC modulate the neural activity levels in the left prefrontal cortex, which influences neural activity in the inferior parietal cortex. Each of these areas has implications in distinct cognitive processes: The prefrontal cortex inhibits the non-target language and corrects errors; the ACC monitors conflicts and detects errors; the basal ganglia, especially the caudate nuclei, supervises the language selection and lexical access; the inferior parietal lobule, as a key region for working memory, serves a goal maintenance function.   further clarified distinct contributions of the left and right supramarginal gyri (SMG) in the inferior parietal lobules: The Left SMG is responsible for bias selection away from the language not in use; on the contrary, the right SMG is responsible for bias selection toward the language in use. This neural network for bilingual language control has been testified in a number of studies. In an fMRI study on German\u2013Italian\u2013English trilinguals,  , ) showed that language-switching directions influenced brain activation levels in the caudate nuclei, while activation levels of the supplementary motor area (SMA)/ACC did not vary as the function of language proficiency, which suggests a domain-general role for SMA/ACC in control tasks. Using meta-analysis approaches,   showed that 10 neuroimaging studies involving language switching reported significant and reliable neural responses in the following brain regions: The left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right precentral gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus (STG), midline pre-supplementary motor area, and bilateral caudate nuclei. Taken together, it is clear that the prefrontal cortex and caudate nuclei are highly involved in the regulation of bilingual speeches. These brain areas have also been reported in studies of non-linguistic cognitive tasks (e.g.,  ). However, how these areas are connected with one another as part of the control network remains unclear. \n\nTaking the advantage of the functional connectivity approach, researchers have attempted to identify the interactions between the language control network and the cognitive control network during L2 acquisition. For example,   in an L2 vocabulary training study showed that the language processing network and cognitive control network were highly integrated at the initial stage of vocabulary learning, but as the learning proceeded and the vocabularies are being consolidated, this integration decreased.   expanded this line of research. Instead of lab-based short-term vocabulary training, they studied neural adaptations in the development of L2 processing by examining a group of classroom Spanish L2 learners who were native English speakers over the course of one academic year. Their results show that with increased L2 experience, the overall activations in the control areas such as the ACC decreases while its connectivities with semantically related regions such as the MTG increases. The authors claim that the ability to utilize cognitive control mechanisms to regulate access to the L2 representations is a more critical issue in the beginning, relative to the latter stage, of L2 acquisition. Taken together, these studies suggest an important role of the cognitive control network in early L2 acquisition. \n\nOne possibility is that the high demand and long-term practice of language control, which involves inhibitory control, during in L2 acquisition, that allows bilinguals outperforming monolinguals in several cognitive control tasks. However, participants\u2019 background variables, such as socioeconomic status and ethnic origins ( ;  ;  ), also seem to matter for the cognitive advantage in bilinguals. It is also possible that language processing contexts account for some of the variances (e.g.,  ). Studies of neural plasticity on high temporal scales ( ;  ;  ) support the notion that different global language contexts (single or dual-language contexts) may lead to distinguished neural activation patterns during target word selection ( ).   proposed an adaptive control hypothesis: Language control processes adapt to the recurrent demands of the interactional context. For example, in a dual-language context, in which both languages are used (but to different speakers), language processing engages the control network comprising bilaterally inferior frontal and parietal cortices, the ACC/pre-SMA, basal ganglia, and thalamus ( ). In a dense code-switching context, however, speakers routinely interleave their languages in the course of a single utterance and adapt words from one of language in the context of the other language. The neural network of language control would rely more on a cerebellar-prefrontal connection as compared to the dual-language context because, in a dense code-switching context, language control involves higher demands for opportunistic planning ( ). \n\nAlthough the adaptive control hypothesis is a recent theory on the neural mechanisms of bilingual control, there has been increasing interest in the influence of language contexts on non-linguistic executive functions, such as inhibitory control. In a study using event-related potentials (ERPs),   examined effects of immediate changes in language processing contexts on executive function in a group of early Welsh\u2013English bilinguals. The cognitive control performance of these participants was measured using a modified version of the classic flanker task, in which participants were instructed to press a button to indicate the direction of an arrow presented within an array of flankers (arrows pointing to the same or the opposite direction). Critically, a word is presented before the flanker trial to implicitly prime a language context. The contextual words were either in Welsh (L1), English (L2), or both languages in separated blocks. The results showed higher accuracy rates when bilingual participants performed incongruent trials of the flanker task in the dual-language context as compared to single-language contexts. The P300 amplitude was also reduced in the dual-language, as compared to the single-language context, indicating less flanker interference effect in the Welsh\u2013English context. Therefore, the authors claimed that changes in language processing contexts could modulate non-linguistic cognitive control in bilinguals. \n\nIn a further exploration,   examined the effect of language contexts on cognitive control in a group of Chinese\u2013English bilinguals. Unlike the highly proficient Welsh\u2013English bilinguals in  , participants in   were native speakers of Chinese who have a moderate level of proficiency in English. All participants performed an antisaccade task, which measures response inhibition (or response suppression), interference inhibition (or inhibitory control), and task switching, three key subcomponents of executive functions ( ). Response suppression refers to the ability to withhold an inappropriate response (e.g., triggered by a habitual cue), as is most classically established in the go/no-go paradigm. Inhibitory control refers to the process when multiple sources of information (e.g., the printing color and the word meaning in the classic Stroop paradigm) are competing for attention which needs to be drawn to the target attribute of the stimulus. Task switching refers to the ability to alter between two tasks that require different cognitive processes and responses. The critical difference between response suppression and inhibitory control is that the former taps onto the process of response execution, whereas the latter mainly measures the control of selective attention. In  , Chinese\u2013English participants performed an antisaccade task in the pre-test and then complete a cued digit-naming task involving both Chinese and English. Following the naming task, the participants performed the same antisaccade task again in the post-test. The results showed that the bilingual naming task enhanced response suppression, impeded the inhibitory control, and made no influence on the performance of task switching. Therefore, the authors suggest that moderate proficient bilinguals may rely heavily on response suppression when making speech production in two languages. As a consequence, the bilingual naming task improved their performance in the antisaccade task. Meanwhile, because of the limited cognitive resources and more involvement of response suppression, inhibitory control might have been allocated with less cognitive resources when moderate proficient bilinguals name digits using alternating languages, explaining the decreased performance in inhibitory control. Task switching involves a different mechanism from response suppression and inhibitory control and was not influenced by the bilingual context. \n\nTo reconcile discrepancies in previous studies, the present study explores the effect of language contexts on the neurocognitive mechanism of inhibitory control in a group of Cantonese\u2013Mandarin\u2013English trilinguals, who were highly proficient in Cantonese (L1)  and Mandarin (L2), and moderate proficient in English (L3). One possibility is that the discrepancies between   and   are not necessarily contradictory; they might arise as a result of differences in the participants\u2019 language background. The Welsh-English bilingual participants in   were highly proficient in both languages; in contrast, the Chinese\u2013English bilinguals in   were intermediate learners of English. Bilinguals with high and low levels of L2 proficiency might adopt different processing strategies during speech production and, therefore, have incomparable implications for executive functions. In the same vein, age of L2 acquisition could also explain discrepancies between the two studies. Early and late bilinguals might engage different cognitive and neural mechanisms during language processing, so that the effect of language context on executive control might not be comparable between the two types of bilinguals. Finally, it is worth noting that unlike Chinese and English, Welsh and English are both alphabetical languages. Switching between two languages with more similarities in linguistic structures might engage different executive components as compared to switching between two languages that differ more radically. \n\nTo verify that language contexts may exert different effects on the inhibitory control of bilinguals with different language backgrounds, the present study examined trilingual speakers while they performed a flanker task ( ) following picture naming in different dual-language contexts: the L1-L2 context, the L2-L3 context, and the L1-L3 context. Within-subject comparisons of their performance in the flanker task following the three contexts will provide a more confident answer to the modulation effect of language context on inhibitory control. It is our hypothesis that in the L1-L2 context (Cantonese\u2013Mandarin), as in  , bilingual context would facilitate inhibitory control performance; in the L2-L3 (Mandarin\u2013English) and the L1-L3 (Cantonese\u2013English) contexts, as in  , the bilingual context would have no beneficial effect on inhibitory control. \n\nThe second goal of the current study is to examine how dual-language contexts modulate the functional brain network for inhibitory control, which is usually right-lateralized. For this purpose, effective connectivity analyses, following a recently developed procedure for valid group modeling, namely Group Interactive Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME,  ) was performed to identify causal relationships between key brain regions that subserve inhibitory control in different dual-language contexts. If dual-language contexts do not influence inhibitory control process, participants should display a typical flanker effect and comparable brain activation patterns as well as common functional brain network when performing the flanker task. If dual-language contexts do modulates inhibitory control, it is our hypothesis that the L1-L2 context would elicit a right-lateralized network for inhibitory control, while the L1-L3 and L2-L3 contexts might engage a less typical inhibitory control network, because of the more demanding task on linguistic processing and language control in the L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts, relative to the L1-L2 context. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThirty students (10 males; age range 18\u201325) were recruited from the Guangdong University of Foreign Studies in Guangzhou, a city with a large Cantonese\u2013Mandarin bilingual community. All participants were highly proficient early bilinguals of Cantonese (first language, L1) and Mandarin (second language, L2): They were raised up in a Cantonese family and have acquired Mandarin since early childhood. At the time of testing, participants use both languages on a regular basis. \n\nAll participants were late learners of English (third language, L3) in the mainstream classroom and had a moderate level of proficiency. They started to learn English at an average age of 7.4 (\u00b11.82). According to their self-report, English and Mandarin were used as the main instruction languages in their English class (English usage: 52% \u00b1 0.22; Mandarin usage: 40% \u00b1 0.2; Cantonese usage: 7% \u00b1 0.11), implying considerable experiences of switching and translation between English and Mandarin as a result of English learning. \n\nAs shown in   Table   , to assess the participants\u2019 linguistic knowledge and background variables in each of their three languages, we asked them to complete the following measures: (1) responses to the Language History Questionnaire (LHQ 2.0;  ) including the age of language acquisition (AoA), usage habits, switching frequency, and language abilities, (2) vocabulary knowledge in each language as examined through naming accuracy rates in a picture naming task (48 out of the 96 high-frequency non-living objects were selected as the stimuli from the battery of   and matched between languages, and (3) the   as measurements of their English proficiency. \n  \nDemographic variables, measures of cognitive skills, and language background information of the Cantonese\u2013Mandarin\u2013English trilingual participants. \n    \nBased on language experience, usage habits, and language proficiency, the participants in the current study were characterized as (1) highly proficient in Cantonese and Mandarin, and with extensive experiences of switching between the two languages during conversations (i.e., in the L1-L2 context), and (2) moderately proficient in English but with more Mandarin\u2013English switching experience (i.e., in the L2-L3 context) than Cantonese\u2013English switching experience (i.e., in the L1-L3 context). All participants were right-handed as measured by the handedness inventory ( ). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment. The Human Research Ethics Committee for Non-Clinical Faculties at the School of Psychology of South China Normal University approved this study. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Materials and Procedure \n  \n#### Cognitive Assessments \n  \nBefore the fMRI session, all participants received a battery of behavioral tests that are designed to measure their non-verbal intelligence (the Raven\u2019s Standard Progressive Matrices;  ) and working memory (the odd-even sequencing task, an adaptation of number-sequencing subtest form the WAIS-III;  ) as shown in   Table   . \n\n\n#### fMRI Procedure \n  \nParticipants completed six event-related fMRI runs, each lasting 6 min and 36 s. As shown in   Figure   , every picture-naming run was presented prior to a flanker run. The order of the three dual-language contexts (i.e., L1-L2, L2-L3, and L1-L3) was counterbalanced between participants in a Latin square design. \n  \nExperiment paradigm   (A)   and fMRI scanning sequence   (B)  . \n  \nThe Picture Naming Task: As shown in   Figure   , picture-naming tasks in the three dual-language contexts followed the same paradigm, each involving two different languages. During the picture-naming task, participants named pictures in two languages alternatingly, with 24 pictures per language. The stimuli were randomly selected from 96 black and white drawings for concrete non-living objects (e.g., piano) in the UCSD International Picture Naming Project (IPNP) picture database  ( ). All stimuli corresponded to high frequency words in both Chinese ( ) and English ( ), and were matched for word frequency (  t   = 0.4,   p   = 0.69) between the two languages. To ensure the familiarity of the object names, we asked an independent group of 35 individuals (age range: 18\u201321) from the same population to rate the familiarity of the object names on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very infrequent; 5 = very frequent). There were no significant differences between the levels of familiarities of object names in the three languages [L1 = 4.0 \u00b1 0.62, L2 = 4.13 \u00b1 0.71, L3 = 3.94 \u00b1 0.74;   F   = 2.65,   p  s > 0.05]. \n\nIn each trial of the picture naming task, a frame was presented for 500 ms and then a picture of an object appeared in the center of the frame for 3000 ms, followed by a blank screen of 500 ms. The color of the frame (blue, red, and green) served as the naming cue (blue for Cantonese, red for Mandarin, and green for English). Participants were instructed to covertly name the picture in the target language within 3000 ms. The 48 picture-naming trials were presented in a pseudo-random order with a jittered inter-stimulus interval (min = 2000 ms, max = 12000 ms) optimized with OptSeq2 ( ).  During the inter-trial interval, a central fixation cross was presented. Due to equipment limitation and to minimize head movements during naming, naming responses were collected outside of the MRI scanner. As an orientation procedure, we informed participants that they would later complete a behavioral test related to the naming task inside the scanner. We collected behavioral data with the same task outside of the scanner 2 weeks after the fMRI sessions (e.g.,  ;  ). \n\nThe Flanker Task: Immediately following each picture-naming task, participants were scanned in a flanker task session, to examine the influence of language context on their inhibitory control process. During the flanker task ( ), participants responded to the direction of a red chevron (i.e., the target) surrounded by other black chevrons (i.e., the flankers). As shown in   Figure   , in congruent trials, flanker chevrons point in the same direction as the target, whereas in incongruent trials, flankers pointed in the opposite direction to the target. Twenty-four congruent trials and 24 incongruent trials were randomly presented during each flanker task scanning session, with jittered inter-stimulus intervals (min = 2000 ms, max = 12000 ms). Each trial began with the presentation of a red fixation for 500 ms, followed by the stimulus for 3000 ms, and then a blank buffer of 500 ms. \n\n\n\n### MRI Acquisition \n  \nMRI images were acquired on a 3-T scanner (Siemens Trio Tim) equipped with a 12-channel phased-array head coil at the South China Normal University, using a T2 -weighted gradient-echo EPI sequence (TE = 30 ms; TR = 2s; flip angle = 90\u00b0; slices = 32; matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64; FoV = 192 mm \u00d7 192 mm; thickness = 4 mm). Participants lay supine in the scanner and viewed the visual stimuli via a back-projection mirror, while their heads were immobilized with cushions. For each run, the functional scanning was always preceded by 6 s of dummy scans (fixation) to ensure tissue steady-state magnetization. High-resolution (1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm) anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted, 3D inversion-recovery gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence. \n\n\n### Data Analyses \n  \n#### Whole Brain Activations \n  \nThe fMRI data were preprocessed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software running under MATLAB (SPM12; Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London).  All three flanker runs followed the same data processing procedure. The first three scans (dummy scans) of the 198 volumes collected were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration. The remaining 195 volumes were then realigned to the first volume for head-motion correction, co-registered to the individual anatomical images and then to the EPI template in SPM12 based on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotactic space, and resampled into 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm cubic voxels. The head motion and rotation of all participants were less than 3 mm of displacement or 3\u00b0 of rotation. \n\nFor each participant, functional images collected from each flanker run were grouped into congruent and incongruent conditions. Individual brain activations corresponding to congruent or incongruent conditions (in contrast to fixation) were analyzed using general linear model (GLM) and were entered into the second level of group analysis to show the neural correlates underlying inhibitory control. \n\nAlphaSim program in the REST ( ) software was used to correct for multiple comparisons in SPM (10,000 interactions). All the brain activations reported below survived an FWE-corrected cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.05 (single voxel:   p   < 0.001, number of voxels > 12) ( ) and were in the MNI coordinate space. \n\n\n#### ROI Selection and Analysis \n  \nBased on previous fMRI literature on language control and inhibitory control ( ;  ;  ;  ), we selected 12 regions of interest (ROIs) to compose a cortical-subcortical-cerebellar network, which includes the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (33, 36, 21), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (48, 9, 21), bilateral insula (INS) (\u00b136, 3, -3), bilateral supramarginal gyri (SMG) (\u00b118, 0, 21), bilateral caudate nuclei (CN) (\u00b118, -21, 24), bilateral thalamus (THA) (\u00b121, -30, 3), and bilateral cerebellum (CERE) (\u00b115, -69, 42). Averaged time course data of all the voxels within a sphere (6 mm radius) in each ROI were extracted using the DPBABI software ( ) . \n\nTo identify activation changes in those regions between congruent and incongruent conditions following the three different dual-language contexts, the present study sorted time series of the 12 ROIs by experimental conditions (e.g., congruent and incongruent). The averaged time course signals across all trials of the congruent/incongruent conditions were converted to percentage signal changes (PSC) using the formula (signal-baseline)/baseline \u00d7 100 for each time point, and the baseline constant was the mean signal of the fixation baseline (e.g.,  ). The averaged PSC values for each condition in every context were considered as representative activation level of each ROI for every participant. \n\n\n#### Effective Connectivity \n  \nTo examine the influence of dual-language context on functional brain connectivity of inhibitory control process in the trilinguals, we made use of recent advances in connectivity modeling (extended unified structural equation modeling, euSEM) ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ) and a recently developed Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME), an automatic and freely distributed MATLAB-based program . \n\nThe euSEM approach has provided a flexible and efficient method for analyzing the causal interactions of brain regions for cognitive functions, as has previously been applied in   and  . The procedure for using the euSEM in the current study is consistent with  , but with two experimental conditions in every language context, namely congruent and incongruent conditions of the flanker task. As with other SEM-based approaches, GIMME works from individual-level correlation matrices. The covariance matrices used for the euSEM analysis include the ROI time series at time t (contemporaneous series, where each \u201ct\u201d is a single brain volume or TR) and the same ROI time series at the next time t + 1 (lagged series). For the euSEM analysis, the covariance matrices also include two time series of the effects of the task inputs (congruent and incongruent) for both time t and t + 1, convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. In addition, the bilinear series can be used to measure the influence of task inputs on the relationship between ROIs by examining time series of each ROI at each time t multiplied by the convolved task input series at time t. The model selections at the group and individual levels are implemented in the following steps. First, Lagrange Multiplier equivalents (i.e., modification indices;  ) are used to identify which effects (including connections among ROIs, the direct and bilinear effects), if freed, optimally improve model fit   across all individuals.   The probability of detecting an effect across all individuals was set at 75%; selection of this criterion was informed by empirical and simulated studies on the likelihood of detecting a true effect should it exist in a given sample (e.g.,  ,  ;  ;  ;  ). The program iterates until the 75% criterion is met. Second, the model is pruned by eliminating connections that are no longer significant for 75% of the group after other connections are freed. Third, individual-level models are estimated in a semi-confirmatory manner. All connections freed in the group model (described in the two steps above) are freed at the individual level. The automatic search procedure within LISREL ( ) then iteratively frees connections that optimally improve model fit, according to the Lagrange Multiplier equivalents ( ). Finally, the model is pruned by eliminating individual-level connections that become non-significant after other individual-level connections are freed, and a confirmatory model is fitted. Model fit parameters, that were found to demonstrate reliability in simulation studies (e.g.,  ) and fMRI studies (e.g.,  ), were chosen   a priori   so that two of the following four criteria were satisfied in the final model: confirmatory fit index (CFI) \u2265 0.9; non-normed fit index (NNFI) \u2265 0.9. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \nAs shown in   Figure   , participants performed more quickly in the congruent condition as compared to the incongruent condition, displaying a typical flanker interference effect ( ) in all three dual-language contexts (  p  s < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in response times between the congruent or incongruent trials following the three dual-language contexts (  p  s > 0.05). \n  \nReaction times (bars; left axis) and accuracy rates (lines; right axis) in the flanker task for the Cantonese-Mandarin-English trilinguals in the L1-L2, L2-L3, and L1-L3 contexts. Reaction times for the congruent condition (C) and incongruent condition (I) were significantly different in the three contexts. For accuracy rate, there was no significant difference between congruent and incongruent conditions when the flanker task was presented in the L1-L2 context. The asterisks indicate significant differences (  p   < 0.001;   p   < 0.05). Error bars depict SEM in reaction time data. \n  \nFor accuracy rates, the flanker interference effect (higher accuracy rates in the congruent as compared to the incongruent trials) was found following the L2-L3 context (two-sample   t  -test,   t   = 2.27,   p   < 0.05) and the L1-L3 context (  t   = 2.32,   p   < 0.05), but not the L1-L2 context (two-sample   t  -test,   t   = 1.14,   p   = 0.26), suggesting a facilitation effect of the L1-L2 context on inhibitory control process. \n\n\n### fMRI Results \n  \n#### Whole-Brain Analysis \n  \nAs shown in   Table   , in the L1-L2 context, incongruent trials elicited additional brain activations in the left inferior parietal lobe. In the L2-L3 context, incongruent conditions involved extra neural responses in the right inferior frontal gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus. In the L1-L3 context, both congruent and incongruent trials evoked neural activities in the right prefrontal cortex, right insula, and subcortical areas. See Supplementary Figure   for brain activations during the naming tasks. \n  \nWhole brain activations associated with the flanker conditions for the Cantonese\u2013Mandarin\u2013English trilinguals in the L1-L2, L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts. \n  \nNo significant differences of neural activations were found between congruent and incongruent conditions in the L1-L2 and L2-L3 contexts. In the L1-L3 context, incongruent condition, as compared to the congruent condition, showed more neural responses in the bilateral inferior occipital gyri (Brodmann area 19, or BA 19), right middle occipital gyrus and bilateral middle temporal gyri (MTG). It is well-known that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is the hub for declarative memory and keeps semantic representation ( ). MTG might be a multimodal semantic processing hub, storing long-term conceptual knowledge, processing lexico-semantic information, and fulfilling semantic integration, especially in the L2 lexical processing ( ). The stronger activation of the bilateral MTG in incongruent trials following L1-L3 context might imply competition of cognitive resources between inhibitory control task and the demanding semantic processing in L1-L3 context. As illustrated in   Figure   , dual-language contexts (i.e., the L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts) involving a moderate proficient language (L3) displayed increased brain activity in the right prefrontal cortex, bilateral insula and inferior parietal lobules, as well as subcortical areas, particularly the bilateral caudate and putamen, as compared to the L1-L2 context. \n  \n (A)   Overall brain activations associated with congruent and incongruent trials of the flanker task as presented in the L1-L2, L2-L3, and L1-L3 contexts;   (B)   Regions of interests that were sensitive to the flanker effect in different dual-language contexts. MFG, middle frontal gyrus; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; INS, insula; CN, caudate nucleus; THA, thalamus; SMG, supramarginal gyrus; CERE, cerebellum; L, left hemisphere; R, right hemisphere;   p   < 0.05. \n  \n\n#### ROI Analyses \n  \nThe following 12 ROIs were chosen based on the extant imaging literature of inhibitory control and language control (see ROI Selection in the Section of Materials and Methods): The right MFG, right IFG, bilateral INS, SMG, CN, Thalamus (THA), as well as bilateral cerebellum (CERE). Our analyses of the percent BOLD signal changes in those ROIs found (1) significant flanker effects in all the three dual-language contexts in the right cerebellum [right CERE,   F   = 15.56,   p   < 0.001]; (2) brain activations in the right IFG and left cerebellum were associated with the flanker effect in the L2-L3 context [right IFG,   F   = 5.65,   p   = 0.024; left CERE,   F   = 6.19,   p   = 0.019]; (3) neural responses in the right cerebellum, right MFG, right IFG, and left INS were associated with the flanker effect only in the L1-L3 context [MFG,   F   = 7.09,   p   = 0.013; IFG,   F   = 58.75,   p   = 0.006; INS,   F   = 4.37,   p   = 0.045] (  Figure   ). \n\n\n#### Connectivity Analysis \n  \nAn extended unified Structural Equation Model (euSEM) analysis was conducted on the fMRI data of the flanker tasks following the L1-L2, L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts. All group maps (  Figure   ) had an excellent fit to the data for roughly 97\u2013100% of the participants, depending on the measure ( ). Specifically, in the L1-L2 context, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) evaluated the model fit as excellent for 100% of the participants\u2019 data, while Standardized ROOT Mean Square Residual (SRMR) and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) showed excellent fit for 97% of the data. In L2-L3 context, CFI, SRMR and the RMSEA results indicated an excellent fit for 100% of the data, as is the same in the L1-L3 context. \n  \nConnectivity maps for inhibitory control process in three dual-language contexts (L1-L2; L2-L3; L1-L3). Significant contemporaneous and lagged relationships at group-level were shown, and auto-regressive lagged connections are omitted for clarity. Connection strength is denoted by beta coefficients, reflected here as the color the line. The solid line indicates contemporaneous relationship, namely area X at time T influences brain activation of area Y at time T; dotted line illustrates lagged relationship, namely area X at time T influences brain activation of area Y at time T + 1. Nodes (ROIs) are MFG, middle frontal gyrus; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus; INS, insula; CN, caudate nucleus; THA, thalamus; SMG, supramarginal gyrus; CERE, cerebellum; R, right hemisphere. \n  \nAs shown in   Figure   , the cortical-subcortical-cerebellar network for inhibitory control following the three dual-language contexts shared common connections: The right INS and thalamus strongly influence their left homologous areas, implying the right-dominant network for inhibitory control; the right IFG feeds to the right MFG, suggesting that the right IFG is highly engaged in bottom\u2013up process of inhibitory control; the right thalamus influences brain activations in the right caudate in a lagged relationship, implying the key role of right thalamus in the communications between cortical and subcortical areas. In all the three contexts, right INS influences right IFG and left SMG. Not surprisingly, the left and right SMG are connected to each other as for the bilateral caudate nuclei. \n\nObviously, in all three dual-language contexts, inhibitory control relied on collaborations between a frontal-parietal network, a cortical-thalamic-striato pathway and bilateral cerebellum. However, dual-language contexts influence inhibitory control network in the trilinguals. To be specific, inhibitory control in the L1-L2 context recruits an efficient and right lateralized network: The right INS as the hub of the network feeds to the right IFG, modulating brain activation in the right MFG indirectly and activating the right SMG; the right THA, as a mediator of frontal-thalamic-striato pathway, receiving positive information from the right INS, feeds to the right CN; right THA is also a key relay station for cortico-cerebellar pathway, forwarding information from the right INS to the left cerebellum, which sends strong and positive influence to the right cerebellum; right SMG forward information from the right IFG to the left SMG, which passes information to the right insula, completing the frontal-parietal sub-network. \n\nWhen the dual-language context involves a moderate proficient language (L3), the functional brain network for inhibitory control in the same group of participants changed immediately. Specifically, in the L2-L3 context, the frontal-parietal sub-network runs in the reverse pipeline: The right IFG actively influences the right INS, which as a hub sends direct and positive information to the left SMG, feeding directly to the right SMG; the right IFG receives feedback from the right SMG and connects to the right MFG. As in the L1-L2 context, right INS influences bilateral caudate via THA in a lagged relationship. The left cerebellum receives inputs directly from the right SMG and feeds to the right cerebellum. Interestingly, the right CN activates left CN in the L2-L3 context, as is the same in the condition of the L1-L3 context. \n\nL1-L3 context involves a moderate proficient language and engages less switching experience between the two languages. Compared with the L1-L2 and L2-L3 contexts, inhibition control in the L1-L3 context relies on a more left-lateralized and less integrated network, compared with the networks in the other two dual-language contexts. In L1-L3 context, the left SMG works as the hub of the inhibitory control network: The right MFG takes the lead and sends orders directly to the left SMG, which relays to the right INS, right SMG, right THA, and right cerebellum. The right THA, as in the other two conditions, forward positive information to the right CN in a lagged relationship, thus completing the cortico-thalamic-striato pathway. For the cerebellar components, the right cerebellum receives weak influence from SMG on the contralateral side and feeds to the left cerebellum. \n\nTaken together, the cortical-subcortical-cerebellar network for inhibitory control involves a frontal-parietal sub-network, cortico-thalamic-striato pathway, and bilateral cerebellum. However, this neural pattern can be modulated by language contexts on a short timescale. In dual-language contexts with intensive code switching between two proficient languages (i.e., the L1-L2 context), the inhibitory control process seems to be facilitated and rely on a right-lateralized control network. When the dual-language context involves a less proficient language, especially when the two languages are radically different from each other, the inhibitory control process relies on a more left-lateralized and less integrated neural network: In the L2-L3 context, the right IFG feeds to right INS and receives feedback from the right SMG; in the L1-L3 context, the right MFG is highly engaged and the whole network relies on the left SMG to modulate brain activations in the cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar areas. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe current study examines the dynamic influences of language contexts on inhibitory control in trilinguals. We explored the neural correlates and functional brain networks activated while Cantonese\u2013Mandarin\u2013English trilingual speakers performed the flanker tasks in three dual-language contexts. As bilingual language processing engages inhibition of the non-target language ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and acquiring a second language facilitates the development of cognitive control ( ;  ;  ), we expected a facilitatory effect of dual-language contexts on participants\u2019 cognitive control performance (e.g.,  ). Our participants were highly proficient in L1 and L2, but moderately proficient in L3. They frequently switch between L1 and L2 in everyday life, but not between L1 and L3 or L2 and L3. We, therefore, expected to observe significant facilitatory effect of the L1-L2 context as compared to the L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts on inhibitory control. \n\nThe results showed the classic flanker effect in the L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts, but not in the L1-L2 context. Consistent with results in a previous study ( ), the effect of contextual priming was observed in accuracy rates but not reaction times, suggesting that independent cognitive mechanisms might account for flanker effects in the two types of measurements. Previous studies (e.g.,  ) using a similar flanker task showed that in the incongruent condition, bilinguals activated a widespread set of brain regions, including the fusiform gyri, inferior frontal gyri, supplementary motor area, inferior parietal regions, and subcortical areas. In the present study, those brain regions for inhibitory control failed to show significant activations in incongruent condition (when compared to the congruent condition) in the L1-L2 context. Moreover, none of the ROIs showed significant interference effects in the L1-L2 context in terms of their BOLD signal change (  Figure   ). These findings suggest that the neural efficiency of the inhibitory control network was enhanced in the L1-L2 context, reducing the classic flanker effect in both the behavioral and the neural anatomical level (e.g.,  ;  ). Effective connectivity analysis shows the following pattern of results: The right insula functions as the hub of the frontal-parietal network, feeding to the right IFG, which mediates the right MFG and bilateral SMG; the right MFG and bilateral SMG then send information to the right THA, which positively modulates brain activations of bilateral caudate nuclei in a lagged relationship and directly influences the cerebellar pathway. The important role of the right insula in inhibitory control has been well documented. In an event-related fMRI study,   showed that performing a response inhibition task activated the right hemisphere, including the right MFG, IFG, insula, and inferior parietal lobule. A more recent study dissociated the functional role of the right IFG and insula in inhibitory control and suggests that the right insula is particularly important for detecting behaviorally salient events, while the right IFG is more involved in implementing inhibitory control ( ). Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that the right frontal-insular cortex has been implicated in switching between central-executive and default-mode networks ( ). \n\nIn the L2-L3 context, behavioral results showed significant flanker effects in both reaction times and accuracy rates (see   Figure   ). Analysis of the neuroimaging data showed that the flanker effect was associated with brain activations in the right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral insula, left rolandic operculum, bilateral supramarginal gyrus, and right thalamus. This pattern of activations is highly consistent with neural mechanisms underlying typical flanker effects (e.g.,  ). ROI analyses showed that the flanker effect was associated with activations in the right IFG and left cerebellum, where no such significant activations were found in the L1-L2 context, suggesting a priming effect on the inhibitory control when the dual-language context involves two highly proficient languages. Connectivity map shows a similar frontal-parietal network, but in the reverse relationship. To be specific, in the L1-L2 context, the right IFG sends feedback to the right MFG and completes the frontal-parietal circuitry via the right SMG and left SMG; in the L2-L3 context, flanker task involves more engagement of the IFG: The IFG passes positive influences to the right INS, forwarding information to the left SMG and the right THA; the right SMG receives signals from the left SMG and sends feedback to the IFG, completing the frontal-parietal loop. \n\nIn the L1-L3 context, the flanker effect is associated with a different neural network, in which the left SMG is the hub. As illustrated in   Figure   , the right MFG influences the left SMG, which influences the right INS, the right IFG, and finally the right MFG, completing a frontal-insula-parietal network without the right SMG; meanwhile, the left SMG directly modulates brain activations in the right THA, which communicates with the right CN in a lagged relationship as in the other two contexts; furthermore, the left SMG feeds to the right cerebellum, which connects to the left cerebellum. This distinction of the neural network in the L1-L3 context, as compared to the L1-L2 and the L2-L3 contexts, is further supplemented by increased activations in the right MFG, right IFG, bilateral basal ganglia and cerebellum (see   Table   ). ROI analyses also showed that activations in the right MFG and right cerebellum were associated with the flanker effect. \n\nResearch in neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience has established the role of the left supramarginal gyrus in the inferior parietal lobule in second language acquisition. Neuroimaging data showed that early bilingualism is associated with increased gray matter density in the left inferior parietal lobe ( ). In addition, researchers have found that the lateral inferior parietal cortex contributes to attentional focalization and target detection in both auditory and visual modalities, indicating its involvement in domain-general attentional processes (e.g.,  ;  ). As summarized by  , second language acquisition might tune this attentional control area into a \u201cmultilingual talent area\u201d as phonological storage and attentional control functions were also subserved by this left inferior parietal lobe. The right SMG, as suggested by  , was particularly involved in language selection in conversations that involve multiple languages. As illustrated in   Figure   , in the L1-L2 context, the right SMG is influenced by the right IFG in a top-down control process, while in the L2-L3 context, it sends feedback to the right IFG, forming a bottom\u2013up stream. \n\nIt is worth noticing that in the L1-L2 context, consistent with the adaptive control hypothesis ( ), the right IFG feeds to the right insula, which influences the right thalamus, thus modulating subcortical areas such as the caudate and connecting the cerebellum. The thalamus has been reported to directly connect to the regions of basal ganglia ( ) and has reciprocal structure connections with the cerebellum as a relay station (e.g.,  ). The left caudate and putamen might be more involved in verb interference effects ( ;  ), while the right homologous areas play a more important role in inhibitory control. Based on our results of trilinguals, dual-language contexts modulate the involvement of inhibitory control areas and their interactions. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe finding that dual-language contexts lead to functional reorganizations of the inhibitory control network not only reconciles discrepancies in previous studies (e.g.,  ;  ), but also provides a novel perspective for investigating the interplay between language control and non-linguistic cognitive processes. To fully understand the nature of the neural mechanisms subserving non-linguistic skills (e.g., executive functions), researchers have to consider the influences of processing contexts. Results of the current study provides empirical evidence in favor of the adaptive control hypothesis ( ), which suggests that interactional contexts (e.g., single-language, dual-language, or frequent-switching) modulate language control processes by adaptive changes in the neural regions and circuits associated with specific control processes. Critically, our results showed that the cognitive system and its underlying neural network are highly plastic, allowing quick development of functional reconfigurations. Short-term language engagement, in the form of contextual priming, can instantly rewire the related brain mechanisms. This finding sheds new light on therapy training programs for individuals with minor cognitive impairment (MCI). Whether or not L2 proficiency, age of acquisition, and cross-language similarities (e.g., alphabetical or non-alphabetical) distinctly contribute to the modulation effects of bilingual contexts requires further exploration. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nJYa, JYe, RW, KZ, and YW designed the study.

The ability to objectively identify individuals with chronic pain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is important for the advancement of diagnosis, treatment, and theoretical knowledge of brain processes associated with chronic pain. The purpose of our research is to investigate specific neurological markers that could be used to diagnose individuals experiencing chronic pain by using multivariate pattern analysis with fMRI data. We hypothesize that individuals with chronic pain have different patterns of brain activity in response to induced pain. This pattern can be used to classify the presence or absence of chronic pain. The fMRI experiment consisted of alternating 14 seconds of painful electric stimulation (applied to the lower back) with 14 seconds of rest. We analyzed contrast fMRI images in stimulation versus rest in pain-related brain regions to distinguish between the groups of participants: 1) chronic pain and 2) normal controls. We employed supervised machine learning techniques, specifically sparse logistic regression, to train a classifier based on these contrast images using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. We correctly classified 92.3% of the chronic pain group (N\u200a=\u200a13) and 92.3% of the normal control group (N\u200a=\u200a13) by recognizing multivariate patterns of activity in the somatosensory and inferior parietal cortex. This technique demonstrates that differences in the pattern of brain activity to induced pain can be used as a neurological marker to distinguish between individuals with and without chronic pain. Medical, legal and business professionals have recognized the importance of this research topic and of developing objective measures of chronic pain. This method of data analysis was very successful in correctly classifying each of the two groups. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nChronic pain, defined as pain that persists for an extended time after the injury has completed the healing phase  \u2013 , is one of the most prevalent health problems in developed countries  \u2013 . It is estimated that chronic pain affects more than 100 million Americans  ,  \u2013 . The increased medical expenses, lost income and lowered productivity make chronic pain one of the most costly health problems in the world. \n\nDespite the importance, interest, and expense associated with chronic pain, there is still no widely accepted objective measure of chronic pain. Diagnosis of chronic pain is based primarily on the subjective reports of the individual  ,  , or subjective reports by care providers. However, cognitive, communicative, and psychological impairments, as well as deception  \u2013 , preclude the reliable use of self-reports in certain situations. While objective measures of pain may not replace subjective pain ratings as argued by Robinson et al.,   and Sullivan et al.,  , it is likely that brain based objective measures of pain may augment and facilitate diagnosis, treatment, and promote better understanding of the underlying cause of different types of pain  ,  \u2013 . For example, while a doctor may identify the presence of a fever by asking the patient if they feel hot or cold, an objective measure of temperature taken by a thermometer greatly improves the diagnosis. \n\nRecently, several studies have focused on assessing the presence and sensitivity of acute pain by applying multivariate pattern analysis to brain imaging data  ,  ,  \u2013  (See   for a comprehensive review of applying machine learning algorithms to pain neuroimaging). Many of these studies were successful at classifying the presence or absence of pain in normal healthy individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain activity data. Depending on the nature of the decoding task and training/testing method, classification performance was as follows: Thermal pain tolerance versus temperature sensation: 91% using Gaussian process classification  ; 86% using relevance vector machines  ; 91% and 86% respectively using support vector machines  ,  ; 95% using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularized principal components regression  . Thermal pain detection versus thermal pain tolerance: 71% using Gaussian process classification;  ; 69% using relevance vector machines  , 68% using support vector machines  . Thermal pain detection versus temperature sensation: 71% using Gaussian process classification  ; 68% using relevance vector machines  ; 91% using support vector machines  ; 61% using laser stimulated near-threshold painful from non-painful trials  . The study by Wager et al.,   in particular defines a \u2018neural pain signature\u2019 that may be a universal signature for pain composed of weighted activity from many brain regions that may be generalized across subjects and is sensitive to different types of pain. It is unclear, however, whether the \u2018neural pain signature\u2019 derived from acute pain will generalize to chronic pain  . \n\nThere is evidence supporting the position that individuals with chronic pain may have a functional reorganization in brain regions associated with pain compared to individuals without chronic pain  ,  \u2013 . This functional reorganization may be the cause of their symptoms in the absence of any physical injury to the body. This reorganization may manifest itself in the form of differences in intrinsic brain connectivity reflected in resting state networks that have been shown to differ in individuals with chronic pain  . Cortical reorganization in individuals with chronic pain has also been shown to manifest itself in regional differences in grey matter density  ,  \u2013 . In particular the study by Ung et al.   utilizes multivariate pattern analysis to successfully classify the presence or absence of chronic pain using morphological differences in the anatomical magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of 47 patients and 47 normal controls with an accuracy level of 76%. \n\nWe hypothesize, based on long-term reorganization in brain processes associated with chronic pain, that individuals suffering from chronic pain do have different patterns of brain activity that can be recorded by fMRI. In this experiment we record alternating periods of painful stimulation each followed by a period of no stimulation using fMRI brain scanning. Since there is known variability in subjective pain sensation in different individuals   we chose to investigate brain activity in response to each individual\u2019s subjective maximum tolerable level in this experiment. Multivariate pattern analysis, in this case, sparse logistic regression (SLR)  , is predicted to be able to recognize differences of brain activity between individuals with chronic pain and normal controls in response to induced pain. A leave-one-out cross-validation procedure is used to train and test the SLR classifiers based on differential activity in contrast images of induced pain relative to rest in specific brain regions thought to be involved with pain processing (Including: primary somatosensory cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, inferior parietal cortex, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex  ). A classifier is defined as a set of variables (in our case, weights of the extracted features of the SLR) that sorts the data samples into different categories. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure the total number of classifiers is equal to the number of participants to be classified. Each classifier is trained on data for all participants except the one upon which it is tested. \n\nOur study extends the use of fMRI data and multivariate pattern analysis techniques to classify individuals with and without chronic pain. Many applications of multivariate techniques to fMRI data have been designed to classify types of stimulus, conditions or trials within a single individual using the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activity from several scans as input from the same individual  ,  ,  . Our goal differs from these studies in that it seeks to demonstrate generalized diagnostic performance for identifying presence or absence of chronic pain for individuals not used during training of the classifier. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Ethics Statement \n  \nAll participants were informed of the experimental procedures to be used. All procedures were approved by the New England Institutional Review Board (NEIRB) in accordance with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave written informed consent prior to the experiment. Participants were paid for taking part in the experiment. \n\n\n### Subjects \n  \nTwenty-six screened individuals participated in this study. Thirteen of the participants had chronic pain (chronic pain group) and thirteen of the participants had no chronic pain (normal, control group). The two groups of participants were matched for gender (nine female and four male), handedness (ten right, two left, one ambidextrous), and race (ten Caucasian, three Black African American). None of the participants had a history of psychiatric illness, organic brain disease, unstable medical illness, or history of serious head injury. The mean age for the chronic pain group was 51.8 years (SE 1.89, range 43 to 65) and the normal group was 48.7 years (SE 2.37, range 38 to 62 years). There was no significant difference in age between the two groups (T\u200a=\u200a0.95, p\u200a=\u200a0.36). \n\nAll chronic pain subjects suffered from muscle-skeletal low back pain. The diagnosis of muscle-skeletal low back chronic pain by the participant\u2019s physician was based on several different criteria including: the duration of the participant\u2019s complaint (minimum of six months), radiological or MRI type exams, tests performed for allodynia and hyperalgesia, confirmation of muscle atrophy, physical weakness, numbness or altered feeling, sleep disorders, memory dysfunction, and range of motion limitation. Additionally, physicians may have augmented their analysis with subjective participant-reported testing information such as the Pain Catastrophising Scale  ; Waddell Signs  , Visual Analog Scale  , and the Fear Avoidance Belief\u2019s Questionnaire   for example. None of the subjects in the normal control group reported suffering from chronic pain. \n\n\n### Equipment \n  \nThe equipment used in this experiment consisted of the following: \n  \nSeimens 1.5 Tesla Entera MRI scanner. \n  \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) approved constant current stimulation device and pulse generation device. \n  \nStimulating Electrodes. \n  \nCoaxial Shielded Lead. \n  \nItem one was used to gather and record data, and items two through four were used to time and deliver stimulation. The stimulation equipment used is compatible for use in the MRI scanner. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nParticipants filled out a questionnaire, were interviewed, and then questioned prior to being included in the study. To prepare for the experiment, the chronic pain participants were required not to take any medication for 12 hours prior to scanning. On the day of the experiment, the level of stimulation that each participant could withstand was determined by applying two self-adhesive electrodes to the participant\u2019s lower lumbar area, one on each side of the spine. The electrodes were then connected to the leads of the constant current generator and pulse timing apparatus. A current of 0.4 mA was initially applied to the participant and increased in 0.1 mA increments until the participant indicated that this was the highest pain level that they could withstand for the duration of the study. This level, for each participant, was the level used during the fMRI experiment for that participant. The stimulation level for the chronic pain group (mean\u200a=\u200a0.819 mA, SE\u200a=\u200a0.116) and the normal group (mean\u200a=\u200a0.662 mA, SE\u200a=\u200a0.063) was not significantly different (T\u200a=\u200a1.22, p\u200a=\u200a0.25). The participants were instructed to remain still throughout the fMRI scanning procedure. Subjects were instructed to inform the experimenter if the pain level was too high and that the experiment could be discontinued at any time. \n\n\n### Experiment \n  \nThe experiment consisted of two conditions: electrical stimulation alternated with no stimulation (rest). Electrical stimulation while the participant lay in the scanner was conducted using the same equipment and level as had been previously determined for each individual. The electrical stimulation was delivered first for 14 seconds then followed by 14 seconds of no stimulation (rest). This sequence was repeated 5 times. The experiment consisted of two fMRI data gathering sessions (approximately 5.25 minutes each) separated by one session in which a T1 high-resolution (0.5\u00d70.5\u00d71 mm) anatomical brain scan was acquired (approximately 4.5 minutes) for each participant. The mean normalized anatomical T1 MRI scans (axial slices from Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) z \u221250 to +85 in 3 mm steps) for the chronic pain group and the normal control group, are displayed in  . Total time for each participant in the MRI room was less than 15 minutes. The order in which subjects underwent scanning was random. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Collection and Preprocessing \n  \nThe experiment was conducted using a Seimens 1.5 Tesla Entera scanner. Functional T2* weighted images were acquired using a gradient echo-planar imaging sequence (repetition time 3670 ms, time to echo\u200a=\u200a60 ms, flip angle\u200a=\u200a90 degrees). A total of 36 interleaved axial slices were acquired with a 3\u00d73\u00d73 mm voxel resolution covering the cortex. A single run consisted of 86 scans (approximately 5.25 minutes). Images were preprocessed using SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping version 8: Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, University College London). Echo planar images (EPI) were unwarped and realigned. The images were then spatially normalized to MNI space (2\u00d72\u00d72 mm voxels) using a template T1 image and the mean EPI image as the source. The images were smoothed using an 8\u00d78\u00d78 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. \n\nRegional brain activity was assessed using a general linear model employing a boxcar function convolved with a hemodynamic response function (block design experiment). High pass filtering (cutoff period 128 seconds) was carried out to reduce the effects of extraneous variables (scanner drift, low frequency noise, etc). Auto-regression was used to correct for serial correlations. For each participant the contrast image of the electrical stimulation condition relative to the no stimulation condition was determined. We hypothesized that this contrasted image would differ for the participant with chronic pain compared to those without chronic pain. \n\n\n### Feature Selection for the SLR Decoder \n  \nOne major challenge for analyzing fMRI data, is the problem of over-fitting the data (an inability to generalize classification to novel test data), since there are far more features than subjects. We utilize two methods to reduce the number of features to overcome problems associated with over-fitting. \n\nThe first method was to utilize a multivariate pattern analysis technique, sparse logistic regression (SLR)  . SLR automatically selects only a few relevant features to be used for training and classification. This method has been shown to be quite effective for fMRI data where there are many more features than there are samples for training  . SLR is a Bayesian extension of logistic regression in which feature selection and training of the model parameters is performed simultaneously, selecting a few highly relevant features to be used for classification. This avoids problems related to over-fitting and enhances classification performance on novel data  . SLR utilizes supervised learning to train a classifier (SLR decoder) based on a known set of input stimuli. For a review of multivariate techniques applied to fMRI data see  ,  \u2013 . \n\nThe second method is to reduce the initial number of features by focusing only on brain regions known to be involved in pain processing, specifically chronic pain processing. We carried out our analyses only on brain regions found to be active during induced pain by Giesecke et al.,  . The brain regions active during induced pain in both chronic pain subjects and normal control subjects (without chronic pain) were: \n  \nprimary somatosensory cortex, \n  \nsecondary somatosensory cortex, \n  \ninferior parietal cortex, \n  \ninsula, and \n  \nanterior cingulate cortex. \n  \nWhile the cerebellum was included in the Giesecke et al.,   study, it was not used in this study, since it wasn\u2019t consistently included in the field of view in the fMRI scanning for all the subjects. \n\nA mask was created using a standard MRI based anatomical atlas (WFU PickAtlas SPM toolbox). The mask (6686 voxels) of these regions of the brain (relative to 153595 voxels over the entire brain) was used for training and testing the SLR decoder. \n\n\n### Training and Testing the SLR Decoder \n  \nClassification of each individual\u2019s data was based on a statistical contrast image from each subject (the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) result of the electrical stimulation relative to no stimulation contrast image SPM con_0001.img) consisting of the masked voxels as described above. A leave-one-out cross validation technique was used to train and test the classification performance of the SLR. Using this cross-validation technique, 25 participants were used to train a SLR decoder which was then tested on the one sample that was left out. Independent SLR classifiers are trained using this procedure until all 26 samples have been tested in an unbiased manner. Performance was assessed by calculating the percent-correct for each of the two groups. \n\n\n### Statistical Analyses \n  \nNon-parametric methods were used to assess the significance of the performance of the SLR decoder using permutation testing of 1000 randomly shuffled labels  ,  . This was accomplished by determining the number of times the performance of the decoder trained with accurate labeling was greater than the distribution of decoders trained with random labeling (assessed using p<0.05). Mean posterior accuracy and the posterior probability interval (serving as a confidence interval at p<0.05) were calculated based on procedures reported in  . Statistical significance of the selected features (using the false discovery rate (FDR) correcting for multiple comparisons pFDR <0.05,  ) was determined in the following manner: The number of cross-validation iterations, out of 26, a feature (voxel) is selected by the SLR decoder using the real labels is compared to the distribution of the number of cross-validation iterations a feature is selected using 1000 permutations of randomly shuffled labels. Essentially, a comparison is made between the number of times a specific voxel is selected using the correct labeling relative to chance (random labeling). \n\nStandard random-effects analyses was used to assess differences in brain activity between the two groups (using SPM8). A between subjects t-test was used to determine differences between chronic pain and normal control subjects over the masked voxels used to train the SLR decoders (using the stimulation relative to rest contrast images). Random-effects between subject t-tests, weighting the brain activity by pain threshold level, were conducted to determine whether differences in general properties of stimulation are responsible for the SLR decoding performance obtained in our study. An additional random-effects analysis was carried out for the chronic pain group to assess the correlation between brain activity and the duration since the onset of the chronic condition. \n\nFor the demographic variables of age and pain threshold level, Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit tests were conducted to determine if the data was normally distributed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test differences in the medians of the chronic pain group and the normal group for the variables of interest when the data was found not to be normally distributed. \n\nThe same preprocessing and statistical parametric analysis methods were carried out for all subjects in both the chronic pain group and the normal control group. The chronic pain versus normal group labeling that each subject belonged to was unknown to the person conducting these analyses. Given that the procedure is completely automated the programs do not have information regarding the group that a particular subject belongs to. This is not the case when training the multivariate pattern analysis classifiers. The utilization of supervised machine learning techniques, in this case sparse logistic regression, to train a classifier to distinguish between two groups requires that the labels be known. During testing, the classifier computes the predicted label of the individual based on the feature weights learned during training. It is important to emphasize that the classifier is completely blind to the true labels of the samples during testing. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe results of the SLR classification for the chronic pain and normal group are given in  . The percent correct was determined by mean performance of the 26 classifiers trained using the leave-one-out cross-validation method explained previously. Significance at p<0.05 was determined using permutation tests of SLR classification over the randomly shuffled labels (1000 random samples) of the subjects in the training set. The overall classification accuracy for both groups together was 92.3% (p<0.05) with a D Prime of 2.924. The percent correct classification for the chronic pain group (sensitivity) was 92.3% (p<0.05) and for the normal group (specificity) was also 92.3% (p<0.05). Posterior mean accuracy and posterior probability intervals were computed using methods reported in   and given in  . \n   Performance of the Sparse Logistic Regression Classifier Chronic Pain versus Normal Group.        \nThe initial number of selected features before training was 6686. This was reduced by using the automatic relevance determination (ARD) characteristic of SLR  ,  ,   to a mean number of 2.85 extracted features across the 26 independently trained SLR classifiers (22 of the classifiers selected 3 features and 4 of the classifiers selected 2 features). It should be noted that the features are the individual voxels selected by the SLR classifier and the weights are the values assigned to each feature used for sorting the data into the different categories. Only five unique features (voxels) were used across the 26 independently trained SLR classifiers. The brain region of these selected voxels and their MNI coordinates are given in  . \n   MNI Coordinates for Sparse Logistic Regression Selected Voxels Weights Classifying Chronic Pain and Normal Individuals.        \nThe five features (voxels) selected defined three clusters of brain activity: Two of the clusters were located in the left primary somatosensory cortex S1, and one of the clusters was located in the left inferior parietal cortex ( ,  ). The features located in the primary somatosensory cortex S1 had negative weights (  blue clusters) signifying that the chronic pain group had lower activity relative to the normal group. The features located in the inferior parietal cortex had positive weights (  red cluster) signifying that the chronic pain group had greater activity relative to the normal group. \n   The three brain regions defined by the voxels selected by the sparse logistic regression located in the primary somatosensory cortex Brodmann Area BA 3 (MNI coordinates \u221242, \u221225,58 and \u221218,\u221243,61) consisting of negative weights (normal group greater than chronic pain group) and the inferior parietal cortex BA 40 (MNI coordinates \u221257,\u221249,25) consisting of positive weights (chronic pain group greater than normal group).  \nA. Shows the three regions rendered on the surface of the brain. These three regions B. Somatosensory (MNI \u221242,\u221225,58), C. Somatosensory (MNI \u221218,\u221243,61), D. Inferior parietal cortex (MNI \u221257,\u221249,25) rendered on surface of MRI images sagittal, coronal, axial slices with MNI coordinates with an 8 mm sphere from center coordinate. \n  \nAll three clusters had features that were significant correcting for multiple comparisons ( ). The only feature (voxel) that was not significant, only being selected for one SLR classifier, was adjacent to the feature (voxel) that was selected for the other 25 SLR classifiers. \n\nTwenty-three of the correctly identified subjects had negatively weighted features from the primary somatosensory cortex S1 and positively weighted features from the inferior parietal cortex (IPC). The two subjects that were incorrectly classified (one chronic pain subject and one normal subject) involved features located in the primary somatosensory cortex S1. \n\nA standard random-effects (SPM8) between-groups two-sample t-test was carried out using the same contrast images that were used during training and testing of the SLR decoder. There were no significant differences (positive or negative) between the chronic pain group (N\u200a=\u200a13) and the normal control group (N\u200a=\u200a13) using a corrected false discovery rate threshold of pFDR\u200a=\u200a0.05. One cluster of activity in the inferior parietal cortex was found for the chronic pain over the normal control group within the pain related regions of interest using a lenient threshold of p<0.005 (MNI \u221260,\u221246,28; T\u200a=\u200a2.88). For the normal control group over the chronic pain group four clusters of activity were found bilaterally in different parts of the postcentral gyrus in the somatosensory cortex with a lenient threshold of p<0.005 (MNI \u200a=\u200a\u221248,\u221222,58, T\u200a=\u200a4.79; \u221221,\u221246,64, T\u200a=\u200a4.19; 60,\u221219,49, T\u200a=\u200a3.44; 39,\u221228,55, T\u200a=\u200a3.00). \n\nTo determine whether differences in general properties of stimulation were responsible for the SLR decoding performance obtained in the study, random-effects between-subject t-tests were conducted in which the brain activity (of the contrast images of stimulation relative to rest) was weighted by each individual\u2019s pain threshold level. No significant difference in brain activity (positive or negative), between the chronic pain group (N\u200a=\u200a13) and the normal control group (N\u200a=\u200a13), was indicated using a corrected false discovery rate threshold of pFDR\u200a=\u200a0.05 over the same voxels used to train the SLR decoder. The voxels selected by the SLR decoder (see  ) did not show any significant differential activity (p>0.05 uncorrected). Nor did a small-volume correction region of interest analysis (with an 8 mm search radius) detect any significant differential activity (p>0.05 corrected) around the voxels selected by the SLR decoder (see  ). \n\nTo assess the correlation between brain activity and the duration since the onset of the chronic condition, a random-effects analysis was conducted for the chronic pain participants in which the contrast images of stimulation relative to rest were weighted by the duration since the onset of the suffering of chronic pain. No significant correlation between brain activity (positive or negative) and duration since the onset of the suffering of chronic pain was indicated using a corrected false discovery rate threshold of pFDR\u200a=\u200a0.05 over the same voxels used to train the SLR decoder. The voxels selected by the SLR decoder (see  ) did not show any significant differential activity (p>0.05 uncorrected), nor did a small-volume correction region of interest analysis (with an 8 mm search radius) detect any significant differential activity (p>0.05 corrected) around the voxels selected by the SLR decoder (see  ). \n\nThe demographics of the chronic pain and normal control subjects are given in  . As indicated, handedness, gender, and ethnicity are balanced across the two groups. Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit tests, over the variables of age and pain threshold level for each of the groups, indicated that the data was not normally distributed. The nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess statistical differences (p<0.05 two-tailed) between the chronic pain group and the normal group for age (Median Chronic Pain Group\u200a=\u200a52 years; Median Normal Group\u200a=\u200a46 years; p>0.1 not significant) and pain threshold level (Median Chronic Pain Group\u200a=\u200a0.75 mA; Median Normal Group\u200a=\u200a0.6 mA; p>0.1 not significant) (See  ). There was no correlation between age and stimulation level for either group (Pearson Correlation p>0.1). Neither was there a correlation between the duration of the chronic pain and pain threshold level or age (Pearson Correlation p>0.1). \n   Plot of age (years) by pain threshold stimulation level (Milliamps) for each of the chronic pain (red) and normal control (blue) subjects.       Demographics for Subjects.        \nA Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess the statistical difference (p<0.05 two-tailed) in pain threshold between male (n\u200a=\u200a8) and female (n\u200a=\u200a18) participants (Median Male Group\u200a=\u200a0.9 mA; Median Female Group\u200a=\u200a0.6 mA; p>0.1 not significant). Even though our results show a tendency in the direction of higher thresholds for males it was not statistically significant. Although the results of several studies have shown that males have higher thresholds to experimentally induced pain than females (see   for review) there have been several studies that do not find statistical differences between males and females  ,  . \n\nEven though the chronic pain subjects had considerable variability in the duration from the onset of the chronic pain condition, the type of medication taken, and the duration the medication was taken, the SLR decoder was able to classify between the chronic and normal individuals with relatively high (92.3%) success. The two individuals that were misclassified by the decoder (one chronic pain and one normal control) do not appear to be outliers with regards to the demographic variables (see   and  ). \n\nTo ensure the SLR classification results are not due to artifacts caused by differential head movement between chronic pain and normal subjects, between group analyses were conducted using the SPM realignment parameters. The summed scan-to-scan difference in the realignment parameters (tested separately for the six realignment parameters: Translation X, Y, Z dimensions, and rotation pitch, roll, yaw dimensions) did not show any statistically significant differences between the chronic pain and normal groups (See  ). Analysis of the total deviation within a session of the six realignment parameters also revealed no statistically significant difference between the chronic pain and the normal group (See  ). \n\nA post-hoc calculation of power was conducted (using procedures given in  ) to determine the sensitivity of the results with the sample size used in our study. Given the incidence of a positive classification in the chronic pain group of 0.923 with a standard deviation of 0.277, and the incidence of a positive classification in the normal group of 0.077 with a standard deviation of 0.277 using a two-sided 95% confidence interval, the power is 100% confirming the sensitivity of the results given the sample size for each group. Power values of 80% are considered to be standard in sample size calculations  . The posterior probability interval   (given in  ) similar to a confidence interval indicates the reliability at estimating the unknown population parameter given a two-tailed 95% confidence level. The posterior probability interval in our study using 13 subjects per group ranges from 75.7% to 97.7%, which is well above the chance level of 50%. Increasing the number of subjects will decrease the posterior probability interval and increase the reliability of the classification results. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe results of the experiment show that multivariate pattern analysis (specifically SLR) of the fMRI contrast image of induced pain relative to rest can be used to classify individuals with chronic pain with a mean accuracy of 92.3% ( ). This classification performance reflects that of novel test samples of a single contrast image (not included in the training), using a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. This degree of classification accuracy is quite impressive when one considers that no statistically significant differential activity correcting for multiple comparisons is present between the chronic pain group and the normal control group using traditional univariate random-effects analysis over the same data. Similarly, it is interesting to point out that the study by  ,   did not find consistent differences between chronic pain and normal groups for acute pain stimulation using univariate analyses. The high predictive performance of the multivariate decoder and the lack of strong univariate differential activity, strongly suggests that (multivoxel) patterns of activity are neurological markers that can be utilized for identifying individuals with chronic pain. \n\nThe SLR decoder selected features in the left inferior parietal cortex and features from two different regions along the postcentral gyrus in the primary somatosensory cortex ( ,  ). These regions are part of the so called \u2018pain matrix\u2019  ,  ,  ,  . This region of the inferior parietal cortex (MNI coordinates \u221257, \u221249, 25) has been associated with heat stimulation   and cold pain  . One region of the somatosensory cortex (MNI coordinates \u221218,\u221243,61) is consistent with somatotopic representation of the trunk region  ,  , whereas, the other (MNI coordinates \u221242, \u221225, 58) is consistent with somatotopic representation of the hand  ,  . It is interesting to point out that individual decoders trained on voxels from the primary somatosensory cortex were able to significantly classify near-threshold pain versus no-pain in the study conducted by   but were not able to significantly classify between painful and nonpainful stimuli in normal individuals in the Brown et al.,   study. \n\nThe use of several different brain regions by the SLR decoder is consistent with the view of pain being a distributed process  ,  ,  . While studies using a multivariate pattern analysis have shown that classification of pain versus no pain significantly utilizes activity in the insula  ,   and anterior cingulate   these regions did not contribute to classifying individuals with chronic pain from normal individuals based on our results. These results suggest that while these regions are important for distinguishing painful from non-painful stimuli the processes in these regions may not differ between individuals with chronic pain and normal individuals. Another possibility may be that the activity in these regions is similar to activity in the somatosensory and inferior parietal regions selected by the SLR decoder. One characteristic of SLR is that it will eliminate features that are similar in order to improve generalization performance. This is perhaps one reason why features are not bilaterally represented along the somatosensory strip as one would expect given that electrical stimulation included both left and right sides of the back. With a larger training sample size it is likely that more features will be selected while maintaining high generalization performance. \n\nThe goal of this study was not to classify between pain and non-painful stimuli as has been done in many other studies  ,  ,  \u2013 , but rather to classify individuals with chronic pain from normal individuals by the patterns of the contrast in activity recorded between painful stimulation relative to rest. It has been conjectured that individuals with chronic pain may have a reorganization of processes within brain regions that is responsible for their ongoing sensation of pain  ,  \u2013 . In the study conducted by Ung et al.,  , multivariate pattern analysis over anatomical MRI of gray matter density was used to successfully classify individuals with chronic pain from normal controls with a accuracy of 76%. The weights of the support vector machine responsible for distinguishing the two groups were consistent with grey matter density decreases in chronic pain individuals in the right borderline amygdala, left medial orbital gyrus, and right cuneus; as well as grey matter density increases in the right cerebellum, regions of the temporal lobe, left primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, left primary motor cortex, the right calcarine sulcus, and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Given the increased grey matter density in somatosensory cortex in the Ung et al.   study one may expect that in our study, individuals with chronic pain would show greater activity in these pain related brain regions under equal \u2018subjective\u2019 pain conditions than normal healthy individuals. (However, see  ,  ,   in which grey matter atrophy was found in individuals with chronic pain in many brain regions including the somatosensory cortex). While greater activity was found in the chronic pain group in the inferior parietal cortex (signified by positive weights meaning chronic pain > healthy normal group), it was not the case for activity in the primary somatosensory cortex (signified by negative weights meaning chronic pain < healthy normal group). Our results are more in line with studies  ,  ,   showing grey matter atrophy in somatosensory cortex as a possible reason for less activity being shown in response to electrical stimulation. While one may predict greater neural reorganization with the duration of chronic pain (denoted by changes in brain activity), this was not indicated by the random-effects analysis of the correlation between duration since onset of the suffering of chronic pain with that of brain activity (see Results). It may be the case that reorganization of neural processing mostly occurs within the first six months from the onset of suffering and does not show a linear relationship with time. In any case, the reorganization in brain activity that takes place was differentiated from that of normal controls by the SLR decoder even with only six months since the onset of suffering chronic pain for some individuals. \n\nThere are several potential reasons why the SLR classifier weighted activity in the somatosensory cortex in the direction of normal individuals. Besides possible grey matter atrophy  ,  ,  , another possibility may be that individuals with chronic pain have a reorganization in inhibitory networks used to suppress pain that causes a reduction in somatosensory cortex activity under intense pain. There is some evidence suggesting potential motor inhibition during painful stimulation in chronic pain individuals  . It has been shown in rats that induced motor cortex stimulation can alleviate chronic pain and has the effect of suppressing somatosensory evoked potentials  . While there are studies reporting increased activity in somatosensory cortex to painful stimulation for individuals with chronic pain relative to normal individuals  , it is possible that in the high pain condition in our study, the individuals with chronic pain may be using acquired pain coping strategies that suppress activity within the somatosensory cortex. Indeed, there have been several studies in which higher pain thresholds are found for individuals with chronic back pain  ,  . \n\nIt is also possible that chronic pain individuals have some degree of residual pain when stimulated that extends longer than healthy normal individuals. Indeed it has been conjectured that chronic pain may resemble that of a persistent memory trace that cannot be extinguished  ,  . It may also be the case that the somatosensory cortex always has some degree of activation in chronic pain individuals associated with their chronic sensation of pain in the absence of any stimulation. This heightened response in the resting state may also result in less differential activity for the chronic pain individuals relative to healthy normal individuals. There is some evidence that the resting state networks of individuals with chronic pain may be different from that of normal healthy controls  ,  ,  . Several aspects of this differential activity need clarification in further research. \n\nIt is important to ensure that the classification performance of a decoder is the result of the features under investigation and not due to some extraneous confound that may be present between the chronic pain group and normal groups. One potential confound that could exist between the two groups is greater head movement in the MRI scanner for individuals with chronic pain. However, statistical analysis of the six realignment parameters did not reveal any differences between the chronic pain and normal control groups (See   and  ). \n\nAn additional confound that one may expect under equal pain conditions is differing levels of stimulation between the two groups. Some studies have shown that pain sensitivity is a correlate of chronic pain status  . When controlling for age, gender, and ethnicity, we did not find any significant difference in the mean threshold level of electrical stimulation between the chronic pain and the normal control groups. Finding no difference between the two groups is desirable, the results of the SLR decoder cannot simply be explained by differential activation in brain regions resulting from different stimulation levels. Indeed the analysis in which the brain activity was weighted by each individual\u2019s pain threshold level, showed no significant difference between the chronic pain group and the normal control group. While some studies have shown lower thresholds for pain in individuals suffering from chronic low back pain  ,   this is not always the case  ,  ,  . In the study conducted by   no difference in electrical stimulation pain thresholds were detected between individuals with chronic low back pain and normal controls. It has also been shown in some studies that individuals with chronic low back pain have higher heat pain thresholds than normal controls  ,  . Given the individual variability and the inconsistency in the published literature on the direction and significance of the difference between individuals with chronic low back pain and normal controls it is unlikely that pain threshold level will serve as a good diagnostic measure above that of the fMRI based SLR decoder presented here. \n\nIt has been shown that there are differences in the pain associated neural activity using different modalities of stimulation  . There are also differences in the temporal characteristics of the onset of the perception of pain with electric being immediate and thermal slower. Because we used only one type of stimulation modality it is possible that the differences in brain activity used by the classifier to distinguish between chronic pain and normal individuals may be a result of brain activity to properties of stimulation that are separate from those of processing induced acute pain. However we do not believe this to be the case here for the following reasons: 1. There was no statistically significant difference in the pain threshold levels used for stimulation for the chronic pain and normal control group. 2. The between-subject analysis in which brain activity was weighted by pain threshold level was not significant in the voxels selected by the SLR decoder (small volume correction analyses using a radius of 8 mm were also not found to be significant) between the chronic pain group and the normal control group. Both of these findings make it unlikely that general properties of stimulation are responsible for the classification performance reported in our study. Rather the results are more consistent with differences between chronic pain and normal individuals in the processes related to the perception of induced acute pain. Even if is found that the ability to discriminate individuals with chronic pain from normal individuals does not generalize to other modalities of stimulation it would not change the relevance of the results of our classification performance using SLR to distinguish between chronic pain and normal individuals using electrical stimulation. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe combination of the experimental design and the multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data presented in this study allowed us to recognize brain markers for chronic pain. The experimental method of using contrast images of painful stimulation versus rest enabled us to successfully identify the presence of chronic pain. This provides further evidence that individuals with chronic pain process induced pain differently from normal individuals and that this difference may arise from reorganization in brain processes resulting from the pathology. This study employs the use of multivariate pattern analysis techniques, specifically sparse logistic regression SLR  , to overcome problems of over-fitting and to successfully classify individuals with chronic pain from normal control individuals with 92.3% classification accuracy with high sensitivity and specificity ( ). While a small sample size was used, only 13 individuals in each group, the unbiased analysis methods performed in this study suggest that these results should be reliable and valid for classifying new individuals using this procedure. Future studies need to be conducted using larger group sizes with greater variability in population demographic variables such as race, gender, and age. With the use of a larger sample size the posterior probability interval will decrease around the mean posterior accuracy providing a more precise predictive measure. \n\nFuture studies should explore the effects that different forms of noxious stimulation (thermal, pressure, electric) and different levels of stimulation (equal physical level, equal just noticeable pain threshold, equal high pain threshold) have on classification performance. The general applicability of the classifier would be greatly enhanced if it were found that different types of stimulation could be used for testing even though the classifier is only trained on a specific type of stimulation being used. In the work conducted by   the classifier trained to detect the presence of acute pain using thermal stimulation was able to generalize to detect acute pain using an opiate analgesic. Future studies should determine whether the classifier generalizes across data collected on different MRI scanners. \n\nIn the present study only muscle-skeletal chronic low back pain was investigated. It would be interesting in future studies to determine if classifiers can generalize across different types of chronic pain, whether certain types of chronic pain are more easily classified, and whether performance of the classifiers can be enhanced by specifically training on each type of chronic pain. \n\nThis study presents a method by which chronic pain can be diagnosed from fMRI contrast images acquired in response to induced acute pain. The brain-based markers determined by multivariate pattern analysis can be used to objectively determine whether an individual has chronic pain. This could have great clinical significance in the diagnosis and treatment of individuals suffering from chronic pain. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: pone-0098007-t001\n### Label: Table 1\nMask\tOverall Accuracy (%Correct)\tChronic Pain (%Correct) Sensitivity\tNormal (%Correct) Specificity\tPositive Predictive Value\tNegative Predictive Value\tPosterior Mean Accuracy\tPosterior Probability Interval\tD Prime\nPain Regions\t92.3???\t92.3???\t92.3???\t92.3\t92.3\t89.2\t75.7\u201397.7\t2.924\n### Caption\nPerformance of the Sparse Logistic Regression Classifier Chronic Pain versus Normal Group.\n### Footer\n*Significant at p<0.05 utilizing 1000 permutation tests of sparse logistic regression SLR classification over randomly shuffled labels of the subjects in the training set.

Prior studies have found that male psychopathy is associated with reduced limbic and paralimbic activation when processing emotional stimuli and making moral judgments. The goal of this study was to investigate whether these findings extend to female psychopathy. During fMRI scanning, 157 incarcerated and 46 non-incarcerated female participants viewed unpleasant pictures, half which depicted moral transgressions, and neutral pictures. Participants rated each picture on moral transgression severity. Psychopathy was assessed using the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) in all incarcerated participants. Non-incarcerated participants were included as a control group to derive brain regions of interest associated with viewing unpleasant vs. neutral pictures (emotion contrast), and unpleasant pictures depicting moral transgressions vs. unpleasant pictures without moral transgressions (moral contrast). Regression analyses in the incarcerated group examined the association between PCL-R scores and brain activation in the emotion and moral contrasts. Results of the emotion contrast revealed a negative correlation between PCL-R scores and activation in the right amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate. Results of the moral contrast revealed a negative correlation between PCL-R scores and activation in the right temporo-parietal junction. These results indicate that female psychopathy, like male psychopathy, is characterized by reduced limbic activation during emotion processing. In contrast, reduced temporo-parietal activation to moral transgressions has been less observed in male psychopathy. These results extend prior findings in male psychopathy to female psychopathy, and reveal aberrant neural responses to morally-salient stimuli that may be unique to female psychopathy. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPsychopathy is a serious mental health disorder defined by a cluster of interpersonal, affective, and behavioral characteristics including impulsivity, grandiosity, and callousness (Hare,  ). A core feature of psychopathy is an inability to experience a normal range and depth of emotions, including \u201cmoral emotions\u201d such as guilt and empathy. These characteristics are early-emerging, severe, and persist into adulthood (Lynam et al.,  ). \n\nDeficits in emotion processing related to psychopathy have been demonstrated across multiple modalities. Psychopathic males show reduced physiological responses to unpleasant and fear-inducing events (Patrick et al.,  ,  ), impaired ability to identify multiple types of facial and vocal expressions (Blair et al.,  ; Kosson et al.,  ; Glass and Newman,  ; Bagley et al.,  ; Dawel et al.,  ), and reduced response facilitation to emotional words in lexical decision tasks (Lorenz and Newman,  ). Fewer investigations of these processes have been conducted in female psychopathy. One study found that low-anxious psychopathic females showed reduced startle potentiation to unpleasant images (Sutton et al.,  ). Another study found that psychopathic and non-psychopathic females performed similarly on tasks evaluating response facilitation to emotional words in a lexical decision task, and response inhibition in a passive avoidance learning task (Vitale et al.,  ). These results suggest that female and male psychopathy share some, but not all, of the same aberrant emotional responses. \n\nNeuroimaging studies have provided additional support of emotional dysfunction in psychopathy. Psychopathic males show reduced engagement of brain regions associated with emotion processing including the amygdala, anterior cingulate/ACC, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex/vmPFC when viewing emotional words, conditioned fear stimuli, statements, or pictures depicting immoral behavior, and during emotional perspective taking tasks (Kiehl et al.,  ; Birbaumer et al.,  ; Glenn et al.,  ; Harenski et al.,  ; Decety et al.,  ). Individuals with high levels of callous-unemotional traits show reduced amygdala activation to fearful facial expressions (Marsh and Blair,  ; Jones et al.,  ), and psychopathic males also show reduced vmPFC and orbitofrontal cortex activation to several types of emotional facial expressions (Decety et al.,  ). Regarding females, neuroimaging studies have reported negative correlations between self-reported psychopathic traits and amygdala responses to fearful facial expressions (Carre et al.,  ) and unpleasant pictures (Harenski et al.,  ). These results suggest that female psychopathy, like male psychopathy, may be associated with reduced engagement of limbic regions during affective tasks. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in females with clinical levels of psychopathy. \n\nEmotion deficits and associated brain dysfunction in psychopathy are believed to impair moral development. Blair ( ) proposed a neurodevelopmental account of psychopathy in which early dysfunction within the amygdala and vmPFC contributes to impaired moral socialization. The proposal is based on the importance of stimulus-reinforcement associations in moral socialization (learning that certain behaviors are harmful to others and should be avoided) and the role of the amygdala (valence, i.e., \u201cgood\u201d/\u201cbad\u201d representation) and vmPFC (outcome expectancy) in these processes. Consistent with this hypothesis, psychopathic males have shown reduced vmPFC and amygdala engagement when presented with pictures depicting immoral behaviors and complex moral dilemmas (Glenn et al.,  ; Harenski et al.,  ). \n\nWhether the neuroimaging findings in male psychopathy summarized above extend to female psychopathy is unknown. We used fMRI to scan a large sample of incarcerated females with varying levels of psychopathy, and a comparison group of non-incarcerated females, while they viewed unpleasant pictures that did or did not depict moral transgressions and thematically-matched neutral pictures. They also rated the severity of moral transgressions. We predicted that psychopathy would be negatively correlated with brain activation while viewing unpleasant relative to neutral pictures in the ACC, amygdala, and vmPFC. We further predicted that activation within the latter two regions would be negatively correlated with psychopathy when viewing unpleasant pictures depicting moral transgressions relative to pictures without moral transgressions. \n\nRegarding the moral salience aspect of the picture task used in this study, the task has been shown to reliably engage brain regions frequently implicated in moral judgment in non-clinical populations (Harenski and Hamann,  ; Harenski et al.,  ,  ). Such regions include the amygdala and vmPFC, and additionally the temporo-parietal junction [which supports several component cognitive processes related to inferring mental states (Decety and Lamm,  )], posterior cingulate and precuneus (Young and Dungan,  ). Whether engagement of these latter regions (i.e., beyond vmPFC and amygdala) would show psychopathy-related differences to moral stimuli was an open question. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe study included 164 incarcerated female volunteers recruited from a medium-security correctional facility, and 46 non-incarcerated female volunteers, who met inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were: age between 18 and 50, reading level above 4th grade, IQ above 75, no history of seizures, no current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) Axis I diagnosis, and no lifetime history of a psychotic disorder in self or first-degree relative. Non-incarcerated participants were excluded if they had any history of alcohol or drug disorder. \n\nSeven incarcerated participants were excluded from analysis due to poor task performance (e.g., drowsiness observed with real-time eyetracking,   n   = 3), or equipment malfunction/experimenter error (  n   = 4). The final sample included 157 incarcerated and 46 non-incarcerated participants. Demographic characteristics of each group are provided in Table  . \n  \n Descriptive statistics and group differences between non-incarcerated and incarcerated participants  . \n    \nAll participants completed the research version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID) (First et al.,  ) to assess past and present Axis I and II disorders. This included the substance use disorder screening questionnaire and module, which were used to evaluate alcohol and drug disorder histories for exclusion purposes (non-incarcerated participants) and quantify prior substance use severity for data analysis (incarcerated participants). The latter was accomplished by counting the total number of lifetime alcohol and drug dependence diagnoses. Substance use disorders accounted for the majority of past Axis I disorders across incarcerated participants, followed by major depression. See Table   in the online data supplement for a complete summary of Axis I and II disorders across participants. IQ was evaluated using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Wechsler,  ). \n\nPsychopathy was assessed in all incarcerated participants using the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) (Hare,  ). The PCL-R is a reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of psychopathy (Hart and Hare,  ) involving a semi-structured interview covering school, employment, relationship and criminal history, and a review of the participant's institutional records. The PCL-R is scored on 20 items measuring personality and behavior characteristics, each with a 3-point severity scale (0, 1, or 2). Total scores range from 0 to 40. Fifteen percent of all PCL-R assessments were independently scored by a second rater (ICC = 0.93). These assessments were similar in score distribution of the entire incarcerated group (  M   = 19.3,   SD   = 6.86, Range = 5\u201331). PCL-R assessments were not conducted in non-incarcerated participants. \n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all participants, after a complete description of the study procedures. The study was reviewed and approved by the University of New Mexico Human Research Review Committee. Participants received monetary compensation for participation. Incarcerated participants were paid at a rate commensurate to work assignments at their facility. \n\n\n### Task \n  \nThree picture sets (25 moral, 25 non-moral, 25 neutral) were created using the International Affective Picture System (Lang et al.,  ) and media sources. Moral pictures depicted unpleasant scenes indicating a moral transgression (e.g., a drunk driver). Non-moral pictures depicted unpleasant scenes without moral content (e.g., an angry driver). Neutral pictures depicted scenes without moral content (e.g., a normal driver). Moral and non-moral pictures were matched on emotional arousal and social complexity, and were matched to neutral pictures on social complexity (the matching procedure is described in detail elsewhere) (Harenski et al.,  ,  ). Matching on social content helped ensure that there were similar numbers of faces and bodies in the different conditions, which have been shown to differentially engage brain regions such as the temporo-parietal junction (Kret et al.,  ). \n\nParticipants rated the severity of moral transgression in each picture from 1 (no transgression) to 5 (high transgression severity). Pictures were displayed for six seconds, followed by a four-second rating scale in which a moving red bar progressed from 1 to 5. The participant pressed a button to stop the bar when it reached their desired rating. This format was chosen for simplicity (pressing one rather than several buttons). Following each rating, a four-second delay preceded the next trial. Moral, non-moral, and neutral trials were randomized along with 25 \u201cjitter\u201d fixation trials (10 seconds) randomly interspersed between picture trials. The 100 trials (25 moral, 25 non-moral, 25 neutral, 25 fixation) were presented across two runs. \n\n\n### Image acquisition and analysis \n  \nMR images were collected using a mobile Siemens 1.5T Avanto with advanced SQ gradients (max slew rate 200T/m/s, 346T/m/s vector summation, rise time 200 us) equipped with a 12-element head coil. The EPI gradient-echo pulse sequence (TR/TE 2000/39 ms, flip angle 90\u00b0, FOV 24 \u00d7 24 cm, 64 \u00d7 64 matrix, 3.4 \u00d7 3.4 mm in-plane resolution, 5 mm slice thickness, 30 slices) effectively covered the entire brain (150 mm) in 2.0 s. Head motion was minimized using padding and restraint. \n\nTo correct residual head motion, \u201cbad\u201d images (confounded by motion or radio-frequency spikes) were estimated and removed using ART-Repair (Mazaika et al.,  ). These images were determined by calculating the mean intensity for a given time series and identifying individual images whose intensity was greater than four standard deviations from the mean. The offending image(s) were replaced in the time series by a rolling mean image, and regressed in the statistical model. The mean number of images removed across participants was 5.5 (of 712). \n\nImaging data were analyzed using SPM5 ( ). Functional images were spatially normalized to the MNI template and smoothed (8 mm FWHM). Picture presentations (moral, non-moral, neutral) and the rating period for all pictures were modeled as four separate events. Each event was modeled with a six (picture) or four (rating) second hemodynamic response function. Functional images were computed for each participant that represented brain activation associated with viewing moral, non-moral, or neutral pictures. The moral + non-moral > neutral comparison evaluated brain activation to emotional pictures regardless of moral content. The moral > non-moral picture comparison evaluated brain activation to morally-salient pictures while controlling for emotional content. Participants' severity of moral transgression ratings of each picture were included as covariates of no interest to model variance associated with individual differences in ratings. PCL-R scores were entered into a regression with individual moral + non-moral > neutral contrast images, and a separate regression with individual moral > non-moral contrast images. PCL-R Factor 1 and Factor 2 scores were also entered into two separate regression analyses, one for each contrast (Factor 1 and Factor 2 scores were positively correlated at   r   = 0.47). \n\nAge and IQ were not significantly correlated with PCL-R or Factor scores. PCL-R and Factor 2 scores were significantly correlated with number of substance dependencies (  r   = 0.25, 0.31, respectively). Substance use severity is associated with reduced functioning in brain regions that overlap with psychopathy (Childress et al.,  ; Thompson et al.,  ). However, substance use may also be considered an integral aspect of psychopathy, thus it would not necessarily be informative to remove substance use-related effects from the results. To thoroughly examine psychopathy and substance-use related effects, we present all analyses with and without substance dependence included as a covariate. \n\nAnalyses were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis over the entire brain using the general linear model in SPM5. Thresholds for whole-brain family-wise error multiple comparison correction were determined using AlphaSim (Ward,  ). Hypotheses were also tested in regions of interest (amygdala, vmPFC, ACC). Peak coordinates for these regions were drawn from the moral + non-moral > neutral and moral > non-moral functional maps of the 46 non-incarcerated participants. In all a priori regions of interest, family-wise error extent thresholds were small-volume corrected using 10 mm spheres surrounding the peak coordinate. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nAll participants rated moral pictures (  M   = 4.0,   SD   = 0.59) higher on transgression severity than non-moral [  M   = 2.4,   SD   = 0.74;   F   = 1109.8,   p   < 0.0001] and neutral [  M   = 1.5,   SD   = 0.29;   F   = 3638.7,   p   < 0.0001] pictures. Non-moral pictures were also rated higher on transgression severity than neutral pictures [  F   = 478.8,   p   < 0.0001], consistent with our prior studies (Harenski et al.,  ,  ) and likely due to the unpleasant content of non-moral relative to neutral pictures. Non-incarcerated participants rated moral and non-moral, but not neutral, pictures higher on transgression severity compared to incarcerated participants (Table  ). Moral, non-moral, and neutral picture ratings in the incarcerated sample were not significantly correlated with PCL-R scores, Factor 1 scores, or Factor 2 scores (all   r  's < 0.09). \n\n\n### Imaging results \n  \nWe first examined the main effects of viewing moral and non-moral > neutral (Figure  ) and moral > non-moral (Figure  ) pictures across all non-incarcerated and incarcerated participants. The main effect of moral + non-moral vs. non-moral pictures revealed increased hemodynamic responses in limbic and paralimbic regions including the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate, as well as ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. The main effect of moral vs. non-moral pictures revealed increased hemodynamic responses in regions previously implicated in moral judgment (Greene and Haidt,  ; Moll et al.,  ; Raine and Yang,  ) including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, temporo-parietal junction, and posterior cingulate. Results were largely similar across incarcerated and non-incarcerated groups. \n  \n Main effect of viewing moral + non-moral vs. neutral pictures in non-incarcerated (NIP;   n   = 46), and incarcerated (IP;   n   = 157) participants (  p   < 0.001, uncorrected)  . \n    \n Main effect of viewing moral vs. non-moral pictures in non-incarcerated (NIP;   n   = 46), and incarcerated (IP;   n   = 157) participants (  p   < 0.001, uncorrected)  . \n  \nRegression analyses were used to examine the relationship between PCL-R scores and brain activation to moral + non-moral vs. neutral pictures across all incarcerated participants. This revealed a negative correlation between PCL-R scores and activation in the right amygdala and rostral ACC (Table  ; Figure  ). Negative correlations were also present in superior and inferior temporal cortex. The regression analysis with Factor 1 and Factor 2 scores showed that the negative correlation with right amygdala and rostral ACC activity was related to Factor 2 but not Factor 1 scores (Table  ). \n  \n Correlations between hemodynamic responses and PCL-R scores among incarcerated participants (  n   = 157) in the moral + non-moral vs. neutral and moral > non-moral picture comparison  . \n  \n BA, Brodmann Area; k, cluster size (voxels). t-values reported for all effects using beta values from GLM regression analyses.

This analysis revealed a negative correlation between PCL-R scores and activation in the right temporo-parietal junction/TPJ (Table  ; Figure  ). Additional negative correlations were present in the parahippocampal and fusiform gyrus. Factor scores were not significantly correlated with any regions of interest; however, the negative correlation between total PCL-R scores and parahippocampal gyrus activation was related to Factor 1 but not Factor 2 scores. \n  \n (A,B)   Correlation between total PCL-R scores and activation in the temporo-parietal junction when viewing unpleasant moral relative to unpleasant non-moral pictures in incarcerated individuals (  N   = 157).

In accordance with hypotheses and prior studies of male psychopathy, PCL-R scores were negatively correlated with activation to unpleasant pictures in the right amygdala and rostral ACC. PCL-R scores were also negatively correlated with activation to unpleasant pictures depicting moral transgressions in the right TPJ. These results extend prior findings regarding emotion processing in adult male psychopathy to female psychopathy, and reveal aberrant neural responses to morally-salient stimuli that may be unique to female psychopathy. \n\nReduced amygdala engagement during emotional processing is a consistent finding in male psychopathy, in such tasks as viewing emotional words, conditioned fear, making moral judgments, and during affective perspective taking (Kiehl et al.,  ; Birbaumer et al.,  ; Glenn et al.,  ; Harenski et al.,  ; Decety et al.,  ). Anatomical imaging studies of male psychopathy have also reported reduced amygdala gray matter volume (Yang et al.,  ; Ermer et al.,  ). While the anatomical findings implicated bilateral amygdala, the present findings and those of prior fMRI studies have often been lateralized to the right (Harenski et al.,  ; Decety et al.,  ) or left (Birbaumer et al.,  ; Glenn et al.,  ) amygdala, though one study reported bilateral effects (Kiehl et al.,  ). Because this is the first fMRI study of female psychopathy in an incarcerated population, it would be premature to conclude that reduced amygdala activation to emotional stimuli is right-lateralized, especially given the focus of this study on moral judgment. Whether these findings extend to other emotion paradigms is a question for future studies. \n\nThe analysis of PCL-R factor scores revealed a negative correlation between right amygdala activation to unpleasant pictures and Factor 2 scores. This is in contrast to prior male psychopathy studies in which negative associations with amygdala activation were primarily related to Factor 1 scores (Harenski et al.,  ; Decety et al.,  ). However, the correlation was no longer significant when substance dependence was included as a covariate. This is likely due to predictor criterion overlap (i.e., substance abuse is a symptom of psychopathy and measured most directly by PCL-R Factor 2 items). Additionally, the negative correlation between right amygdala activation and total PCL-R scores was significant regardless of the inclusion of substance dependence as a covariate. \n\nRelative to the amygdala, the status of ACC function in psychopathy is less clear. ACC dysfunction is proposed in some theoretical models of psychopathy (Kiehl,  ) but not others (Blair,  ). Anatomical and functional imaging studies of the ACC in male psychopathy have produced mixed findings. Anatomical studies have not reported reductions in ACC volume (Glenn et al.,  ; Ermer et al.,  ), whereas functional imaging studies have found reduced rostral ACC responses during emotion tasks (Kiehl et al.,  ; Birbaumer et al.,  ). Here we observed a negative correlation between PCL-R scores and rostral ACC activation to unpleasant pictures. The region of rostral ACC that was correlated with psychopathy corresponds to the rostral section of the anterior mid cingulate cortex/aMCC, bordering the pregenual anterior cingulate. The aMCC has been implicated in studies examining a wide variety of negative emotion and cognitive control processes and has extensive connections with subcortical brain regions including the amygdala and ventral striatum (Shackman et al.,  ). One possible explanation for functional but not anatomical psychopathy-related differences in this region is that it may be anatomically intact in psychopathy but less responsive when processing emotional stimuli due to reduced input from one or more of the emotional processing brain regions with which it is connected (e.g., amygdala). \n\nSimilar to the findings in the right amygdala, the analysis of PCL-R factor scores revealed a negative correlation between rostral ACC activation to unpleasant pictures and Factor 2 scores. Unlike the findings in the amygdala, this result was unaffected by substance dependence. Prior psychopathy studies that reported reduced ACC function did not examine associations with Factor scores (e.g., Kiehl et al.,  ; Birbaumer et al.,  ). Thus, it is unknown whether the Factor 2-ACC negative correlation during emotion processing is unique to female psychopathy or also present in male psychopathy. More research in both male and female psychopathy is needed to explore this possibility. Overall, the current results suggest that reduced ACC function during emotion processing is related primarily to the lifestyle/antisocial aspects of female psychopathy. It is also worth noting that PCL-R Factor 2 contains items relevant to the developmental nature of psychopathy, including childhood, adolescent, and adult-related disruptive behavior; thus the effects related to Factor 2 may be developmental in nature. \n\nThe comparison of moral vs. non-moral pictures yielded results that were less consistent with prior findings in male psychopathy. PCL-R scores were negatively correlated with right TPJ activation. In our prior study of male psychopathy using the same moral judgment task, psychopathy was not associated with reduced (or increased) TPJ responses when viewing moral pictures (Harenski et al.,  ). However, psychopathic males showed a positive correlation between right TPJ activation and severity of moral transgression ratings. Non-psychopathic males, in contrast, showed no correlation between right TPJ and severity ratings. Drawing from neuroimaging and lesion evidence regarding the role of the right TPJ in moral judgment (Greene and Haidt,  ; Moll et al.,  ; Raine and Yang,  ), particularly in attributing intentions to moral transgressions (Young et al.,  ; Koster-Hale et al.,  ), we proposed that intention attributions influenced severity of moral transgression ratings more in psychopathic males relative to non-psychopathic males. In the present study, female psychopathy was associated with less engagement of the right TPJ when viewing all moral pictures (regardless of how moral transgressions were rated) which could indicate a generally reduced sensitivity to the intentionality aspect of moral transgressions. \n\nAlthough the role of the TPJ in making intentionality attributions during moral judgment has been well-demonstrated, studies have highlighted other functions of this region. For example, the right TPJ has been implicated in sense of agency, self-other discrimination, and directing attention to task-relevant stimuli (Decety and Lamm,  ; Mitchell,  ). Decety and Lamm ( ) proposed that rTPJ is associated with a variety of lower-level processes (e.g., redirection of attention) that contribute to higher level functions such as mentalizing. Thus, lower TPJ activation in psychopathic females could be related to intention attribution and/or other TPJ-related processes. The moral pictures contained multiple cues that could be differentially attended to by high and low psychopathy females. In other words, specific components of the pictures that are considered relevant to moral judgment, and the amount of attention paid to those components, may differ as a function of psychopathy. Future studies employing methods such as eye tracking could shed light on this possibility. Right TPJ activation has also shown elevated activation in individuals with heightened justice sensitivity as well as in individuals more likely to exculpate harmful actions resulting from innocent intentions (Young and Saxe,  ; Yoder and Decety,  ). It is possible that females higher in psychopathy have reduced justice sensitivity, which may be emphasized when evaluating moral transgressions and related to TPJ activation. This possibility requires further study. Regarding the forgiveness of unintentional moral transgressions, psychopathic males are in fact more likely than non-psychopathic males to exhibit this behavior (Young et al.,  ). However, whether psychopathic females are similar to psychopathic males in this respect has not been investigated. \n\nPCL-R scores were unrelated to behavioral moral judgments. This result is in line with prior findings in male psychopathy using the same task (Harenski et al.,  ), and other studies showing similar moral judgments in psychopathic and non-psychopathic males (Cima et al.,  ; Aharoni et al.,  ). However, male psychopathy-related differences in certain types of moral judgment have been reported (Koenigs et al.,  ; Young et al.,  ). The moral task used in this study was relatively straightforward compared to other tasks such as moral dilemmas. Female psychopathy may be associated with abnormalities in the latter type of moral judgment. \n\nLimitations of this study should be considered. The standard PCL-R cutoff score for psychopathy is 30/40. Eight participants in this study scored 30 or higher on the PCL-R. We might have observed stronger and/or additional correlations between brain activation and PCL-R scores if more 30+ participants were included. Previous studies used lower PCL-R cutoff scores (e.g., 24) to identify female psychopathy (Vitale et al.,  ,  ) due to lower base rates of psychopathy relative to males at the 30 cutoff score (Vitale et al.,  ) and lower levels of criminal behavior in females than males (Goldstein et al.,  ). Regarding our emotion task, it should be emphasized that participants made moral judgments of all pictures. We previously demonstrated that judging morally-salient pictures on severity of moral transgression, relative to making indoor/outdoor judgments of the same pictures, was associated with greater activation in the vmPFC, a region prominent in neurodevelopmental theories of psychopathy (Harenski et al.,  ). It is possible that using a more \u201cimplicit\u201d emotional task not related to moral judgment could yield additional/different findings. \n\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated that females with clinical levels of psychopathy show reduced amygdala and ACC activation when processing emotional stimuli, similar to findings in male psychopathy. Female psychopathy was also associated with aberrant right TPJ activation related to moral judgments, but the results differed from prior findings in male psychopathy. Overall, the results provide new evidence of neurobiological dysfunction in female psychopathy and support theories of limbic and paralimbic dysfunction in psychopathy. \n\n### Conflict of interest statement \n  \nThe Reviewer, Dr. Decety declares that, despite having collaborated with Dr. Kiehl, the review process was handled objectively.

On the basis of a recent cognitive model of sequential motor behavior (C-SMB), we propose that the observed neural activity would be associated with three functional networks that can operate in parallel and that allow (a) responding to stimuli in a   reaction mode  , (b) sequence execution using spatial sequence representations in a   central-symbolic mode  , and (c) sequence execution using motor chunk representations in a   chunking mode  . On the basis of this model and findings in the literature, we predicted which neural areas would be active during execution of the unfamiliar and familiar keying sequences. The observed neural activities were largely in line with our predictions, and allowed functions to be attributed to the active brain areas that fit the three above functional systems. The results corroborate C-SMB\u2019s assumption that at advanced skill levels the systems executing motor chunks and translating key-specific stimuli are racing to trigger individual responses. They further support recent behavioral indications that spatial sequence representations continue to be used. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAn important current research issue concerns the way in which people control habitual movement sequences like writing one\u2019s signature and typing one\u2019s name. Over the years, this issue has been addressed with numerous behavioral and imaging studies (for recent reviews, see Abrahamse, Ruitenberg, De Kleine, & Verwey,  ; Ashby, Turner, & Horvitz,  ; Diedrichsen & Kornysheva,  ; Hardwick, Rottschy, Miall, & Eickhoff,  ; Keele, Ivry, Mayr, Hazeltine, & Heuer,  ; Penhune,  ; Penhune & Steele,  ; Verwey, Shea, & Wright,  ). Meta-analyses of imaging studies show that motor control and motor learning are generally associated with increased activity in the primary motor cortex (M1), the dorsal premotor cortex, the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), the superior parietal lobule, the supplementary motor areas (SMAproper and preSMA), the putamen, the thalamus, and multiple cerebellar nuclei (Hardwick et al.,  ; Laird et al.,  ; Toro, Fox, & Paus,  ). Laird et al. ( , also see Ray et al., 2013) distinguished three motor networks with different functions: (a) a network including M1, S1, and the cerebellum that is responsible for executing hand and finger movements like finger tapping, grasping, and pointing; (b) the medial superior parietal cortex that extends this M1-S1-cerebellar network and that supports the execution of more complicated motor skills like drawing and reaching; and (c) a network consisting of premotor and supplementary motor cortices that is involved in preparing and executing fixed movement sequences and their timing. These meta-analyses synthesize the commonalities across many tasks, but they do not give detailed information on the functional contribution of each of these brain structures to motor behavior in specific tasks, and exactly how practice affects the associated neural activity patterns. For that reason, there is a need for studies addressing more specifically the function of individual brain regions in motor tasks. \n\nMotivated by recent developments, we believe that a detailed understanding of the neural system requires insights from cognitive task models (Berlot, Popp, & Diedrichsen,  ; Cookson, Hazeltine, & Schumacher,  ; Forstmann, Wagenmakers, Eichele, Brown, & Serences,  ; Krakauer, Ghazanfar, Gomez-Marin, MacIver, & Poeppel,  ; Love,  ). The reason is that these cognitive models distinguish separable processes that most likely emerge from activity in different neural networks. We report here an imaging study in which participants performed a   Discrete Sequence Production   (DSP) task (Verwey,  ). This task is interesting for imaging research because extensive behavioral study has produced detailed cognitive models (Abrahamse et al.,  ; Verwey,  ; Verwey et al.,  ). Also, unlike many other motor tasks, the DSP task lends itself to scrutiny in MRI scanners because it involves movements that give little motion artefacts. \n\nParticipants in DSP experiments practice two short (\u201cdiscrete\u201d) key-pressing sequences separated by a clear break. While practicing in an initial phase in which participants react to two series of key-specific stimuli, the task turns into a two-choice reaction time task in which each response consists of a familiar keying sequence. From a behavioral perspective these discrete movement sequences are interesting because the resulting motor representations are believed to produce the building blocks of complex, hierarchically controlled motor skills (Balleine, Dezfouli, Ito, & Doya,  ; Cisek & Kalaska,  ; Park, Wilde, & Shea,  ; Shea & Kovacs,  ; for recent real world examples, see Arnold, Wing, & Rotshtein,  ; Thompson, McColeman, Stepanova, & Blair,  ; Yamaguchi, Crump, & Logan,  ). Recent interest comes from robot designers who are inspired by the way evolution shaped human motor control when they develop algorithms for motor learning and control in robots (Kupferberg et al.,  ; J. Peters, M\u00fclling, Kober, Nguyen-Tuong, & Kr\u00f6mer,  ). \n\n### C-SMB: A cognitive model for sequencing behavior \n  \nIn the present study we assessed the neural activity associated with the learning and execution of keying sequences in the DSP task, and we interpreted that activity in terms of the execution modes proposed by the   Cognitive framework for Sequential Motor Behavior   (C-SMB, Verwey et al.,  ; an extension of the   Dual Processor Model  , Abrahamse et al.,  ; Verwey,  ) .  This is a useful undertaking because C-SMB provides indications as to why imaging of different motor sequencing experiments usually shows a broad activation pattern that also greatly differs across tasks. C-SMB suggests that in the case of short, discrete movement sequences this is caused by a functional   Central Processor   and a   Motor Processor   that together are responsible for three sequence execution modes: (a) a   reaction mode   in which the Central Processor translates each key-specific stimulus into the associated response, (b) a   central-symbolic mode   in which within tens of trials responses are derived by the Central Processor from spatial and verbal sequence representations (representing, e.g., one\u2019s PIN), and (c) a   chunking mode   in which after hundreds of trials motor chunk representations are used by the Motor Processor to rapidly execute the responses that make up the motor sequence. The reduced involvement of the Central Processor in the chunking mode explains the automatic nature of motor sequence execution and the limited role of explicit sequence knowledge in sequential motor skills (Baars,  ,  ). Motor chunks include only four or five key sequence elements (Acuna et al.,  ; Verwey,  ; Verwey, Abrahamse, & De Kleine,  ; Wymbs, Bassett, Mucha, Porter, & Grafton,  ), so that longer sequences involve spontaneously developing concatenation of motor chunks. An important insight from behavioral findings is that at skilled levels the Motor Processor executing motor chunks may be racing with the Central Processor translating key-specific stimuli. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that spatial representations continue to be used for determining responses as well (Barnhoorn, D\u00f6hring, Van Asseldonk, & Verwey,  ; Verwey, Groen, & Wright,  ). \n\n\n### Neural activity in the present study \n  \nWe recently reported data from an fMRI study showing that timing in new (i.e.,   unfamiliar  ) four-key DSP sequences relies on a cortico-cerebellar network (Jouen et al.,  ). The present article used previously undescribed data from the same study in order to uncover networks associated with C-SMB\u2019s reaction, central-symbolic, and chunking modes. To that end, we analyzed the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response, relative to simple control sequences, when unfamiliar and highly practiced (  familiar  ) four-key sequences are being executed. On the basis of C-SMB, we propose that (a) the neural activity observed when unfamiliar sequences are executed reveals the neural substrate of reacting to key-specific stimuli as well as using (spatial) central-symbolic representations, and that (b) the neural activity during execution of the familiar sequences shows the neural areas involved in executing motor chunk representations and, again, reacting to key-specific stimuli. In turn, these two assumptions imply that (c) the activity overlap between unfamiliar and familiar sequences reflects the areas involved in reacting to key-specific stimuli. We note that C-SMB\u2019s distinction between neural systems for central symbolic and motor chunk representations is similar to Hikosaka et al.'s ( ) spatial and motor neural networks, but unlike Hikosaka et al. we make the explicit assumption that these sequencing systems, and the system responsible for triggering individual responses using the element-specific stimuli, may be simultaneously active. \n\nOn the basis of imaging studies with choice reaction time tasks in which individual responses are given to stimuli, we expected that reacting to key-specific stimuli in the unfamiliar and familiar sequences would activate occipital and temporal areas for stimulus processing, right dorsal prefrontal and superior parietal areas for stimulus localization, and the left dorsal premotor cortex for selecting movements on the basis of stimulus location (Adam et al.,  ; Grafton, Fagg, & Arbib,  ,  ; Picton et al.,  ; Rushworth, Johansen-Berg, G\u00f6bel, & Devlin,  ; Schumacher, Elston, & D'esposito,  ; Schwarb & Schumacher,  ). Earlier work suggests that parietal activities may reflect spatial, but also non-spatial, response selection mappings (like category membership, Seger,  ). Furthermore, the preSMA would be involved in storing and retrieving visuomotor associations during the selection of responses (Nakamura, Sakai, & Hikosaka,  ; Picard & Strick,  ; Sakai et al.,  ). \n\nExecuting unfamiliar sequences is typically associated with activity across a broad neural network. According to C-SMB, this network is involved in the spatial and/or verbal central-symbolic and the reaction modes, but does not involve activities associated with executing motor chunks. For these unfamiliar sequences, we expected activity in the well-known cortico-striatal-palidal-thalamo-cortical (in short: cortico-subcortical) executive loop that is engaged in working memory (Alexander, DeLong, & Strick,  ; Lawrence, Sahakian, & Robbins,  ; Seger,  ). This loop comprises DLPFC (in the present task possibly responsible for explicit spatial element order; Bo, Peltier, Noll, & Seidler,  ), bilateral posterior parietal cortex (coding spatial aspects of the responses and the sequence; Bo et al.,  ; Grafton, Hazeltine, & Ivry, 1998), the anterior basal ganglia (especially the associative striatum that would control element order; Bo et al.,  ; Doyon et al.,  ; Haber,  ; Jueptner et al.,  ; Seger & Spiering,  ), and several nuclei in the cerebellum (Bo et al.,  ; Floyer-Lea & Matthews,  ; Hikosaka et al.,  ; Penhune & Doyon,  ; Steele & Penhune,  ; Wymbs & Grafton,  ). SMA activity in sequencing tasks has further been associated with representing motor sequences in working memory (Cona & Semenza,  ; Doyon et al.,  ; Halsband & Passingham,  ; Jenkins, Brooks, Nixon, Frackowiak, & Passingham,  ; Rosenberg Katz et al.,  ). PreSMA activity would be involved especially in early practice (Hill & Schneider,  ), and would indicate temporal aspects of motor sequences (Cona & Semenza,  ). Dorsal and ventral premotor cortex, along with cerebellum (especially lobule VI), would support initial sequence learning (Bo et al.,  ; Wymbs & Grafton,  ). The activity usually observed in the left dorsal premotor cortex has been associated with retrieving sequence-specific, effector-unspecific knowledge (Bo et al.,  ; Gabitov, Manor, & Karni,  ; Ohbayashi, Picard, & Strick,  ), possibly in a spatial code (Nakamura et al.,  ). Instead, the activity often observed in the ventral premotor areas would represent processes critical for visually guided movements (Bisschoff-Grethe, Goedert, Willingham, & Grafton,  ; Hoshi & Tanji,  ; Mushiake, Inase, & Tanji,  ; Werner, Dannenberg, & Hoffmann,  ). \n\nC-SMB further postulates that after substantial practice short motor sequences are primarily controlled using motor chunks. Based on imaging studies with extensively practiced sequences we hypothesized that the chunking mode would activate the cortico-subcortical sensorimotor loop that includes SMA and the posterior striatum (Hikosaka et al.,  ; Seger,  ). At this practice level, SMAproper has been argued to develop and implement motor chunks (Cona & Semenza,  ; Verwey, Lammens, & van Honk, 2002), and preSMA would initiate individual motor chunks (Kennerley, Sakai, & Rushworth,  ; Ruitenberg, Verwey, Schutter, & Abrahamse,  ; Shima & Tanji,  ). Should spatial representations indeed be used at advanced skill levels too (Barnhoorn et al.,  ; De Kleine & Verwey,  ; Verwey et al.,  ), then activity can be expected in the left dorsal premotor and parietal cortices too (Nakamura et al.,  ; Ohbayashi et al.,  ). \n\nIn summary, we hypothesized that: (1) Executing relatively unfamiliar keying sequences activates a broad network underlying both the reaction and central-symbolic modes. Sequence execution on the basis of spatial central-symbolic sequence representations was expected to induce frontal activity (especially in DLPFC, dorsal and ventral premotor cortex, and SMA), bilateral posterior parietal activity, and activity in the anterior basal ganglia and cerebellar nuclei. (2) Executing familiar sequences was expected to activate a network involved in especially the chunking mode, which would include the SMA and posterior striatum, possibly extended by activity of the left dorsal premotor and some parts of the parietal cortex to support the reaction mode. Finally, (3) given the assumption that stimuli may still trigger individual responses in both unfamiliar and familiar sequences, we expected activity across the unfamiliar and familiar sequences in frontal areas (the right dorsal prefrontal and left dorsal premotor cortex, and preSMA), superior parietal areas, and temporal/occipital areas (see Table   for an overview of predictions and observed activities). \n\n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Participants \n  \nEighteen right-handed healthy volunteers participated in this study (mean age 22.5 years, SD=1.8; eight males). The participants were all students from Lyon University. Prior to the scanning session, they underwent an examination to validate their medical state and MRI compatibility. No participant had a history of neurological no psychiatric disorders. They all completed the entire fMRI test. Two of them were removed from the analysis because of the high number of motion-related artefacts in the cerebral images. The protocol was approved by the Lyon Ethics Committee (Centre L\u00e9on Berard CPP number: 06/013) and the participants gave their informed consent before the scanning session. \n\n\n### Apparatus \n  \nThe experimental protocol was implemented in Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, NY, USA) on a Windows XP-based PC that also measured the four response times (RTs) in each sequence (i.e., T T ) in both sessions. A Lumina key pad (Cedrus, San Pedro, CA, USA) was used for registering key presses that are suited for use in MRI scanners. The RTs and errors were analyzed using Statistica (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). fMRI was assessed with a 1.5 T system (Siemens CTI, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) at the Imaging Center of Lyon (CERMEP \u201cImagerie du vivant\u201d). \n\n\n### Task and stimuli \n  \nWhile performing the DSP task, participants rested four fingers of the right hand on four keys of the key pad. Visual stimuli displayed on the screen involved filling one of four permanently displayed squares. The participants responded to these stimuli by pressing the spatially corresponding key. As soon as the correct key had been pressed, the square was filled again with the background color and immediately another square was filled until four keys had been pressed. The participants were instructed to press the associated key as fast as possible while keeping errors to a minimum. Faulty key presses were immediately followed by an error message (by changing the visual stimulus from white to a color). This DSP task has previously been described more eloborately (Verwey,  ; for a review of method and results, see Abrahamse et al.,  ). \n\nWe used four experimental sequences: IRML, MLIR, RIML, and LMRI (  I  ndex,   M  iddle,   R  ing,   L  ittle finger), and two simple control sequences: IMRL, LRMI. The experimental sequences never involved key presses by adjacent fingers while the control sequences involved an order that was easy to learn in that it included a left-to-right or a right-to-left succession of the four key presses. These six sequences were divided in participant-specific ways into a familiar and an unfamiliar set, each one consisting of one control sequence and two experimental sequences. One of the two experimental sequences in both the familiar and unfamiliar sets was structured by including an 800-ms pause between the second response and the third stimulus, while all other RSIs were 0. In the structured sequence of the familiar set this pause occurred during practice but not during scanning, while in the unfamiliar-structured sequence it occurred during scanning. Because in the present study we focused on the unstructured sequences, any mention of unfamiliar and familiar sequences in his article refers to the unfamiliar-unstructured and familiar-unstructured sequences. The experimental sequences were balanced so that, across all participants, each of the four experimental sequences occurred as frequently in each of the four experimental conditions (familiar and unfamiliar sequences, without and with a pause). Likewise, the two control sequences were evenly distributed across the familiar and unfamiliar sequence sets. \n\nThe experiment included a 14-block practice session that was followed after a 30-min break by a fMRI scanning session. During practice, participants sat in front of a computer display on a table with the fingers of their right hand on a key pad. Each practice block included the three sequences of the familiar set (structured, unstructured, and control) in a random order. These sequences were practiced for a total of 1,500 trials, approximately 500 trials for each sequence. A 10-min pause was inserted halfway through the practice session. The entire practice session lasted approximately 2.5 h. \n\n\n### fMRI scanning \n  \n#### Setup \n  \nAt the start of the scanning session, participants were comfortably installed in the MRI scanner. Head movements were prevented using a foam cushion and a frontal band, which were attached to the scanner bed. The visual stimuli were displayed by video-projector on a translucent screen located behind the scanning bay. The participant looked at the screen via a mirror fixed inside the scanner at 20 cm over the participant\u2019s head. The key pad was located comfortably on the participant\u2019s lap. \n\n\n\n### Scanning procedure \n  \nBrain scanning involved assessment of the BOLD fMRI signal. For each run, whole brain coverage was obtained with EPI (echo planar imaging) images (repetition time TR=2,500 ms, echo time TE=60 ms, and flip angle 90\u00b0). Twenty-six brain sections were acquired in an interlaced mode parallel to the AC-PC plane. Slices had a thickness of 4.4 mm [matrix 64 \u00d7 64; and field of view (FOV) = 230 mm]. Following functional image acquisition, a high-resolution T1-weighted anatomic image was acquired (TR=1,880 ms; TE 3.93; flip angle 15\u00b0; matrix 256 \u00d7 256; and slice thickness 1 mm). \n\nThe scanning session involved four runs. Two runs included three unfamiliar sequences: one experimental sequence that included an 800-ms pause between the second response and the ensuing stimulus during scanning, one experimental sequence without pause, and one control sequence. The other two runs included three familiar sequences: two experimental sequences without a pause and one control sequence. These three sequences had been practiced prior to scanning, but the pause between the second response and the third stimulus in one of them was removed during scanning. Half the participants started the scanning session with a familiar sequences run, the other half with an unfamiliar sequences run. Then familiar and unfamiliar runs alternated. Each run lasted approximately 10 min and successive runs were separated by 2-min breaks. Each run included 150 trials, 50 trials with each of the three sequences. These three sequences were executed in random order. The interval between the first stimulus of two successive sequences was 4 s in duration, jittered by trials of 8-s ISI. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nProcessing of the fMRI data involved Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM 5, Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London UK;  ) running under Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). The first five scans of each run (i.e., the first 12.5 s and hence the first two or three sequences) were discarded to eliminate non-equilibrium effects of magnetization and warming up effects in the participants. For preprocessing, the functional images were realigned with respect to the first functional image for motion correction and were corrected for slice acquisition timing in reference to the middle slice in each scan. The resulting volumes were spatially normalized to fit to an EPI template in MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space. The normalized images were then spatially smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian filter kernel at an 8-Hz bandwidth. For each participant the BOLD impulse responses to different event types were modeled in the context of a general linear model (GLM) by using the hemodynamic response function (HRF) convolved with a delta (event-related) function. \n\nOn the basis of the GLM model (Friston et al.,  ), the task-related BOLD changes were estimated as linear combinations of the individual regressors and stored as participant-specific contrast images. Contrasts were realized using several regressors in order to study the differences between the experimental and control sequences (i.e., unfamiliar-experimental, unfamiliar-control, familiar-experimental, familiar-control). This involved unfamiliar-experimental > unfamiliar-control and familiar-experimental > familiar-control. The overall contrasts included the following four contrasts: unfamiliar-unstructured > unfamiliar-control, familiar-unstructured > familiar-control. These contrasts were selected to extract the activated neural structures that were differently activated when executing the familiar and unfamiliar unstructured experimental sequences relative to the control sequences. \n\nFor the statistical group analysis, the individual contrast images were then processed in a second-level random effects model by using a full factorial design to extract significant neural activations for each type of sequence. The main effects for learning unstructured sequences were processed and specific activations related to familiar and unfamiliar sequences were extracted by inclusive masking at p<.05 with the respective t-contrasts, i.e., familiar-unstructured > familiar-control and unfamiliar-unstructured > unfamiliar-control. Significance level of activation was established with a false discovery rate (FDR) correction at the voxel level (threshold of p<.005) for whole-brain voxels with minimal spatial extent of 10 contiguous voxels per cluster. In order to determine the neural structures activated in common during the familiar and unfamiliar unstructured sequences, we performed a conjunction analysis between the corresponding contrasts at p <.001, based on Nichols\u2019 procedure (Nichols, Brett, Andersson, Wager, & Poline,  ). All MNI coordinates of the cerebral activation foci were transformed into Talairach coordinates using the formula developed by Matthew Brett ( ). Brodmann areas were determined using the stereotaxic atlas (Talairach & Tournoux,  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \n#### Response times \n  \nWe analyzed RTs in the scanning session with a 2 (Familiarity) \u00d7 2 (Type: unstructured vs. control) \u00d7 4 (Sub-run: Trials 1\u201325 vs. 26\u201350 of Runs 1 and 2) \u00d7 4 (Sequence Position T \u2013T ) repeated measures ANOVA. This analysis showed main effects of Familiarity, F(1,15)=41.1, p<.001,   \u03b7  =.73, Type, F(1,15)=89.8, p<.001,   \u03b7  =.86, Sub-run, F(3,45)=16.8, p<.001,   \u03b7  =.53, and Key, F(3,45)=175.9, p<.001,   \u03b7  =.92. As expected, the difference between the unstructured and control sequences was larger in the unfamiliar than in the familiar condition, F(1,15)=4.9, p=.04,   \u03b7  =.25. Practice in the four sub-runs reduced T -T  more than T , F(9,135)=16.7, p<.001,   \u03b7  =.53 (see Figure  ).   \nResponse times in the familiar and unfamiliar and control sequences across sub-runs 1\u20134 in the test phase carried out in the scanner \n  \n\n\n#### Errors \n  \nA 2 (Familiarity) \u00d7 2 (Type: unstructured, control) \u00d7 2 (Run 1 vs. 2) \u00d7 4 (Sequence Position) repeated measures ANOVA was carried out on arcsine transformed error proportions. The Key main effect showed that error rate increased from 1.0% at Response 1, to 1.8% at Response 3, and reduced to 0.4% at Response 4, F(3,45)=9.4, p<.001,   \u03b7  =.39. This relatively high error rate at Response 3 was more pronounced for the familiar than for the unfamiliar sequences, 2.3% versus 1.3%, F(3,45)=4.5, p<.001,   \u03b7  =.23, and higher for the control than for the unstructured sequences, 2.5% versus 1.0%, F(3,45)=4.2, p=.01,   \u03b7  =.22. \n\n\n\n### Functional MRI results \n  \nIn the analyses below, we removed movement execution-related activities by using contrasts relative to the left-to-right and right-to-left control sequences, and focused on sequence learning by determining activations of the familiar and unfamiliar sequences. \n\n#### Unfamiliar sequences \n  \nActivity associated with unfamiliar sequences (revealed by the inclusive masking of unfamiliar sequences on the main effect of learning) appeared widespread across the brain (Table  , Fig.  ). Anteriorly, significant BOLD changes were found bilaterally in the supplementary motor area (SMA) forming a spreading cluster peaking on the left side (Ke=91). The frontal lobe was strongly activated predominantly in the left hemisphere forming large clusters in (1) the superior frontal and precentral gyrus (BA6) symmetrically activated in both hemispheres, (2) the left middle prefrontal gyrus (BA6) extending to the precentral cortex posteriorly and including anteriorly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC: BA9, 46) with a maximal activation at TAL -38 30 21 (Ke=261), and (3) the inferior prefrontal gyrus as a large left cluster spreading from the middle to the inferior prefrontal cortex (BA9, 6, 44) and as a right cluster peaking at TAL 61 9 27. Activity was further found bilaterally in the post-central sensorimotor cortex partially including the motor cortex (BA3, 4).   \nAnatomical and functional regions of activation for unfamiliar and familiar sequences (both relative to the control sequences) \n  \n Notes.

As illustrated in Fig.  , a substantial cluster was identified in the left temporo-occipital region including associative visual areas (BA19, 37, 39). In the subcortical structures, executing the unfamiliar sequences significantly activated the basal ganglia at two small right patches in the postero-ventral region of the putamen and caudate nucleus, and a substantial left activation in the cerebellum that formed a large cluster (Ke 327) peaking in the declive at Tal -14 -47 -13 and extending medially over 20 mm to the vermis. \n\n\n#### Familiar sequences \n  \nCerebral activation associated with familiar sequences (revealed by inclusive masking of familiar sequences on the main effect of learning) was globally reduced relative to unfamiliar sequences, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, as shown in Fig.   and Table  . Importantly, while the inferior and middle prefrontal cortices including DLPFC were no longer recruited, the SMA and the superior and middle prefrontal cortex (BA6) remained activated, forming several bilateral small clusters (Table  ). In the posterior cortex, substantial BOLD responses were found bilaterally in the superior and inferior parietal cortex (BA7, 40) forming large clusters extending medially and caudally over 10 mm into the precuneus on the left and the supramarginal region on the right. While the middle occipital regions were not recruited with familiar sequences, the right superior temporal cortex was found activated in the temporal pole (BA 38) as a limited focus peaking at TAL 40 18\u201329. In the subcortical region, a significant BOLD response was observed in basal ganglia only in the right caudate nucleus.   \nClusters of activation for the familiar sequences (familiar-unstructured>control sequences) at FDR p < .05.

The statistical data related to these activations are shown in Table  . Fig.   illustrates the activation in common for the unfamiliar and familiar sequences along with the specific activation for each of them, unfamiliar and familiar sequences.   \nAnatomic and functional regions of significant activation, relative to the control sequences, in common for familiar and unfamiliar sequences (i.e., the conjunction analysis) \n  \n Tal   Talairach coordinates,   BA   corresponding Brodmann\u2019s area \n\nFunctional area designations (in parenthesis) are based in part on Mayka et al.

As systematically shown in Table  , the regional activities that we derived from the literature using this hypothesis appeared in good alignment with the observed activities relative to the control sequences, and they also provided support for recent behavioral indications that spatial sequence knowledge continues to be used as skill develops.   \nOverview of the predicted and observed relative neural activities with the presumed cognitive functions \n  \nOverlapping activities in familiar and unfamiliar sequences include the conjunction analysis results in Table   as well as activities identical for unfamiliar and familiar sequences in Table  \n\nPosterior parietal includes superior and inferior parietal areas \n  \n\n### Unfamiliar sequences \n  \nThe RT results of the unfamiliar sequences show the typical slow first response followed by much faster execution of the ensuing responses. This RT pattern is not observed with sequences consisting of random stimulus orders (Barnhoorn, Panzer, Godde, & Verwey,  ; Verwey & Wright,  ). Performance therefore demonstrates that participants had started learning the unfamiliar sequences during the scanning session. \n\nThe neural activity pattern demonstrates that executing unfamiliar sequences activated bilateral DLPFC and anterior parts of the striatum. These two areas are parts of the executive cortico-subcortical loop that is involved in working memory (Haber,  ; Lawrence et al.,  ; Seger & Spiering,  ). Working memory is used when the links between sensory inputs, thoughts and actions are weak or rapidly changing (Miller & Cohen,  ; Postle,  ). In line with this idea, the DLPFC previously showed activation early in the course of sequence practice, and also when participants were instructed to again pay attention to the execution of an already familiar motor sequence (Jueptner et al.,  ), because DLPFC is associated with the spatial aspects of reacting in keying sequences (Robertson, Tormos, Maeda, & Pascual-Leone,  ). We further observed activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus. This area would underlie the executive functions of total response inhibition, response-specific inhibition, and response delay (Aron, Robbins, & Poldrack,  ). DLPFC most likely does this by modulating connectivity between other brain regions (K\u00fcbler, Dixon, & Garavan,  ; Passingham, Rowe, & Sakai,  ; Rae, Hughes, Anderson, & Rowe,  ). Here, the right inferior frontal gyrus may have reduced the contribution of the reaction mode network as the central-symbolic execution mode developed. \n\nThe observed activities in the left occipital and left inferior temporal areas are typically associated with perceiving and identifying visual objects, and retaining these in working memory (Ishai, Ungerleider, Martin, Schouten, & Haxby,  ; Kolb, Whishaw, & Teskey,  ; Nakamura et al.,  ). The concurrent activity in the posterior parietal cortex and precuneus can be attributed to the orienting of overt and covert spatial attention (Giesbrecht, Woldorff, Song, & Mangun,  ; Just & Varma,  ). The repeated execution of fixed spatial attention patterns during sequence execution may have been responsible for the development of spatial central-symbolic sequence representations in the posterior parietal cortex and precuneus (Abrahamse et al.,  ; Zhang & Ekstrom,  ). \n\nThe activity of the ventral part of the premotor cortex was specific for unfamiliar sequences. The ventral premotor cortices have been argued to translate allocentric perceptual coordinates into egocentric motor coordinates (Bisschoff-Grethe et al.,  ; Hoshi & Tanji,  ; Mushiake et al.,  ; Werner et al.,  ), and they did indeed appear active especially early in practice (Toni, Rushworth, & Passingham,  ). In the present unfamiliar sequences, the ventral premotor cortices may have selected responses on the basis of the stimulus locations they received from parietal areas that were developing a spatial central-symbolic sequence representation. \n\nExecuting unfamiliar sequences was further associated with activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus and the preSMA, areas known to play a domain-independent role in sequence control. The left inferior frontal gyrus overlaps in part with Broca\u2019s area, and has been argued to not only be involved in verbal but also in spatial sequence representations (Binkofski & Buccino,  ; Friederici, Rueschemeyer, Hahne, & Fiebach,  ; Koechlin & Jubault,  ). The preSMA, together with the inferior frontal left cerebellar and premotor cortex, is perhaps involved in the timing of motor chunk development (Cona & Semenza,  ).  Such a timing function would fit the left cerebellar activity observed by us and in other studies with unfamiliar sequences (Doyon et al.,  ; Doyon, Penhune, & Ungerleider,  ; Jouen et al.,  ; Jueptner et al.,  ; Steele & Penhune,  ). \n\nIn summary, the pattern of activity associated specifically with the unfamiliar sequences can be interpreted in terms of: (1) a prefrontal-striatal network that is at the basis of executive control of various functional processes including working memory, (2) a left occipital-left temporal-bilateral posterior parietal network for developing and applying central-symbolic (most likely spatial) sequence representation, (3) ventral premotor activity for selecting individual responses from the parietal sequence knowledge, and (4) a left inferior frontal-preSMA-cerebellar network responsible for timing of sequence execution. \n\n\n### Familiar sequences \n  \nThe notion that motor chunk development relies primarily on the cortico-subcortical sensorimotor loop (Cona & Semenza,  ; Kennerley et al.,  ; Ruitenberg et al.,  ; Shima & Tanji,  ; Verwey et al.,  ) is corroborated by the observed activity in the preSMA and the activity shift with practice in the posterior direction in the basal ganglia. This increasing role of motor chunks further fits the often encountered brain-wide activity reduction with practice, which can be seen in Table   as well (Chein & Schneider,  ; Hill & Schneider,  ; Picard, Matsuzaka, & Strick,  ; Wymbs & Grafton,  ). \n\nExecution of familiar sequences was further associated with activity in the right superior temporal, bilateral posterior parietal, and dorsal premotor cortices (Table  , cf. Bisschoff-Grethe et al.,  ; Wymbs & Grafton,  ). The lasting activity in the dorsal premotor cortex, which coincided with the lasting activity in parietal areas, supports the idea that the dorsal premotor cortex receives spatial information from the parietal and the prefrontal cortices allowing it to select responses on the basis of parietal sequence representations (Chouinard & Paus,  ; Rijntjes et al.,  ; Schwarb & Schumacher,  ; Wiestler, Waters-Metenier, & Diedrichsen,  ). These activities therefore support the suggestion in the   Introduction  , based on imaging studies (Nakamura et al.,  ; Ohbayashi et al.,  ) and behavioral DSP studies (Barnhoorn et al.,  ; De Kleine & Verwey,  ; Verwey et al.,  ), that after extensive practice spatial sequence representations may still be involved in triggering the responses in the familiar sequences. This may especially occur when sequences are short, like the ones in the present experiment (Ellenbuerger, Boutin, Blandin, Shea, & Panzer,  ; Panzer, Krueger, Muehlbauer, Kovacs, & Shea,  ). \n\nIn short, execution of the familiar sequences in the chunking mode was associated with the sensorimotor loop that included the posterior striatum and SMA. The present results further indicated involvement of a network including areas in the temporal, posterior parietal, and dorsal premotor cortex that probably underlay continued involvement of the spatial central-symbolic execution mode. \n\n\n### Reacting to stimuli \n  \nThe areas showing activity in both unfamiliar and familiar sequences included preSMA, bilateral dorsal premotor areas, and bilateral posterior parietal and precuneus. As argued in the   Introduction  , we attribute these activities to responding to individual stimuli using spatial and perhaps also non-spatial associations (Seger,  ). The preSMA activity common to unfamiliar and familiar sequences occurred about 10 mm from the activity associated exclusively with the unfamiliar and with the familiar sequences, suggesting the preSMA was involved in two different networks (Xiong et al.,  ). One network would be responsible for skilled motor sequence control (Cona & Semenza,  ; Verwey et al.,  ), and the other for establishing and retrieving modality- and effector-independent visuomotor associations when responding to key-specific stimuli in the reaction mode (Nakamura et al.,  ; Picard & Strick,  ; Sakai et al.,  ). \n\nReacting to stimuli seems to have also activated the dorsal premotor areas, the bilateral posterior parietal cortex, and the precuneus. In this network, the rostral part of the dorsal premotor cortex may well receive spatial stimulus information from prefrontal cortex and preSMA to select individual responses (Chouinard & Paus,  ; Schwarb & Schumacher,  ). The fact that we did not observe activity in the left occipital and inferior temporal areas across unfamiliar and familiar sequences is inconsistent with stimuli being reacted to at all practice levels. This may, however, been concealed because participants probably processed stimuli in our control sequences too (given that display of stimuli at different locations attracts visual attention; Proctor, Miles, & Baroni,  ; Yantis & Jonides,  ). \n\n\n### Unanticipated activities \n  \nWe did not anticipate the activity in S1 and left M1 when unfamiliar sequences were executed because all activities were relative to control sequences. This finding allows some speculation, however. Recent approaches assume that M1 codes movements in terms of highly familiar, meaningful behaviors like hand postures (Ejaz, Hamada, & Diedrichsen,  ; Graziano,  ; A. J. Peters, Lee, Hedrick, O'Neil, & Komiyama,  ). The present M1-S1 activity may therefore reflect learning new hand postures, and/or new sequences of already familiar hand postures. Given the effector-specificity of M1 and S1, this early M1-S1 activity may eventually be responsible for the development of effector-specific sequence learning (Hikosaka et al.,  ; Verwey, Abrahamse, & Jim\u00e9nez,  ; Verwey & Wright,  ) and coarticulation (i.e., the effect in a familiar motor sequence of the next on the current movement, Gentner, Grudin, & Conway,  ; Jordan,  ; Rumelhart & Norman,  ; Sosnik, Hauptmann, Karni, & Flash,  ). Indeed, some researchers found indications for sequence learning in M1 after extensive practice in a task especially reliant on hand postures, which is the finger opposition task (Karni et al.,  ). This M1-S1 activity may be specific for sequences that rely much on hand postures, are practiced extensively, and are eventually carried out at very high rates. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this S1-M1 activity was caused by the unusual supine position during scanning with the hand on the keyboard on the participant\u2019s lap, which may have required learning new hand postures too. \n\nThe activity in the right superior temporal cortex during execution of familiar sequences was not expected either. The right temporal cortex is usually involved in semantic knowledge (Rice, Lambon Ralph, & Hoffman,  ; Visser, Jefferies, Embleton, & Ralph,  ), and is usually not active with sequence learning. It was reported to be active though when participants were recognizing unnatural actions (Binkofski & Buccino,  ), and expert dancers were viewing familiar movement patterns (Calvo-Merino, Glaser, Gr\u00e8zes, Passingham, & Haggard,  ). In the DSP task, participants have been found to select motor chunks as a whole (Verwey,  ), and perhaps this temporal activity reflects the selection of motor chunks via an abstract representation of the movement pattern as a whole (e.g., an event file; Hommel,  ; Hommel, M\u00fcsseler, Aschersleben, & Prinz,  ). \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe present study demonstrates how a cognitive model can help understand the broad and variable patterns of neural activity that are typically reported with motor sequencing tasks. The observed neural activities were largely consistent with the hypothesis that motor sequence learning involves three sequence execution systems that develop at different rates, and that race to trigger individual elements in the sequence. We consider this study especially important because these results now allow further tests of the interpretations we gave to the obtained neural activities. \n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1.\nAnatomic area(functional area1)\tBA\tUnfamiliar sequences\tUnfamiliar sequences\tUnfamiliar sequences\tFamiliar sequences\tFamiliar sequences\tFamiliar sequences\nAnatomic area(functional area1)\tBA\tTal\tZ\tKe\tTal\tZ\tKe\nB (pre)SMA\t6\t-2 6 49\t3.77\t91.0\t-2 5 50\t3.67\t25.0\nL Middle frontal gyrusL Precentral gyrus(L PMd)\t6\t-24 -7 46\t3.78\t29.0\t\t\t\nR Superior frontal gyrus R Middle frontal gyrusR Precentral gyrus(L PMd)\t6\t\t\t\t38 -4 65\t3.87\t72.0\nR Superior frontal gyrus R Middle frontal gyrusR Precentral gyrus(L PMd)\t6\t\t\t\t38 -3 46\t3.3\t72.0\nR Superior frontal gyrus R Middle frontal gyrusR Precentral gyrus(L PMd)\t6\t\t\t\t42 -5 56\t3.28\t72.0\nR Superior frontal gyrus R Middle frontal gyrusR Precentral gyrus(L PMd)\t6\t26 -9 50\t3.45\t29.0\t24 -5 61\t3.09\t18.0\nR Superior frontal gyrus R Middle frontal gyrusR Precentral gyrus(L PMd)\t6\t24 -5 61\t3.09\t\t24 -5 61\t3.09\t18.0\nR Superior frontal gyrus R Middle frontal gyrusR Precentral gyrus(L PMd)\t6\t28 -4 70\t3.08\t18.0\t28 -4 70\t3.08\t18.0\nL Superior frontal gyrus(L PMd)\t6\t-32 -1 59\t3.44\t98.0\t-32 -1 59\t3.44\t30.0\nL Superior frontal gyrus(L PMd)\t6\t-20 -8 66\t3.4\t98.0\t-32 -1 59\t3.44\t30.0\nL Middle frontal gyrusL Precentral gyrus(L PMv/PMd)\t6,9,44\t-50 4 35\t4.91\t428.0\t\t\t\nL Middle frontal gyrusL Precentral gyrus(L PMv/PMd)\t6,9,44\t-53 9 23\t4.09\t428.0\t\t\t\nL Inferior frontal gyrus(L PMv)\t6,9,44\t-47 2 42\t4.08\t428.0\t\t\t\nR Inferior frontal gyrusR Precentral gyrus(R PMv)\t6, 9\t61 9 27\t4.42\t142.0\t\t\t\nR Inferior frontal gyrusR Precentral gyrus(R PMv)\t6, 9\t63 0 37\t3.5\t142.0\t\t\t\nL Middle frontal gyrus(L DLPFC)\t9,45,46\t-38 30 21\t4.32\t261.0\t\t\t\nL Middle frontal gyrus(L DLPFC)\t9,45,46\t-40 38 20\t3.53\t261.0\t\t\t\nL Middle frontal gyrus(L DLPFC)\t9,45,46\t-34 29 30\t3.26\t261.0\t\t\t\nR Middle frontal gyrus\t46\t44 47 16\t3.56\t24.0\t\t\t\nL Postcentral gyrusL Precentral gyrus(L S1/M1)\t4,3\t-57 -16 32\t4.21\t108.0\t\t\t\nR Postcentral gyrus (R S1)R Inferior parietal gyrus\t4,2,3,5, 40\t53 -23 40\t5.26\t1851.0\t40 -31 38\t4.14\t543.0\nR Postcentral gyrus (R S1)R Inferior parietal gyrus\t4,2,3,5, 40\t63 -18 34\t4.67\t1851.0\t34 -40 55\t4.05\t543.0\nR Postcentral gyrus (R S1)R Inferior parietal gyrus\t4,2,3,5, 40\t34 -40 52\t4.41\t1851.0\t42 -30 49\t3.82\t543.0\nR Superior parietal gyrusR Precuneus\t7\t18 -55 52\t3.73\t55.0\t20 -57 52\t3.47\t36.0\nR Superior parietal gyrusR Precuneus\t7\t26 -55 60\t3.08\t55.0\t26 -55 60\t3.08\t36.0\nR Superior parietal gyrusR Precuneus\t7\t20 -49 65\t3.4\t63.0\t20 -49 65\t3.4\t63.0\nL Superior parietal gyrusL Inferior parietal gyrusL Precuneus\t40, 7\t-28 -39 42\t5.2\t2117.0\t-34 -46 56\t5.16\t894.0\nL Superior parietal gyrusL Inferior parietal gyrusL Precuneus\t40, 7\t-34 -46 56\t5.16\t2117.0\t-46 -36 48\t4.45\t894.0\nL Superior parietal gyrusL Inferior parietal gyrusL Precuneus\t40, 7\t-20 -64 47\t4.71\t2117.0\t-12 -65 55\t4.42\t894.0\nL Middle occipital gyrusL Inferior temporal gyrus\t37, 39\t-42 -66 7\t4.35\t384.0\t\t\t\nL Middle occipital gyrusL Inferior temporal gyrus\t37, 39\t-53 -68 1\t3.76\t384.0\t\t\t\nL Middle occipital gyrusL Fusiform gyrus\t19,37\t-44 -61 -14\t3.17\t15.0\t\t\t\nL Middle occipital gyrusL Fusiform gyrus\t19,37\t-46 -62 -6\t3.07\t15.0\t\t\t\nR Superior temporal gyrus\t38\t\t\t\t40 18 -29\t3.89\t40.0\nR Pallidum-putamen\t\t22 2 0\t3.97\t29.0\t\t\t\nR Caudate nucleus (anterior)\t\t12 2 7\t3.46\t48.0\t\t\t\nR Striatum (posterior)\t\t8 8 -2\t3.43\t48.0\t24 -34 13\t3.63\t21.0\nR Striatum (posterior)\t\t6 -3 11\t3.0\t48.0\t24 -34 13\t3.63\t21.0\nL Cerebellum \u2013 declive, culmen\t\t-14 -47 -13\t4.37\t327.0\t\t\t\nL Cerebellum \u2013 declive, culmen\t\t-2 -47 -13\t4.33\t327.0\t\t\t\nL Cerebellum \u2013 declive, culmen\t\t-24 -40 -23\t4.19\t327.0\t\t\t\nL Cerebellum \u2013 declive\t\t-8 -67 -19\t3.82\t40.0\t\t\t\n### Caption\nAnatomical and functional regions of activation for unfamiliar and familiar sequences (both relative to the control sequences)\n### Footer\nNotes.

In this research, a novel feature-map based ICA framework (FMICA) was proposed to address the aforementioned deficiencies, which aimed at exploring brain functional networks (BFNs) at different scales, e.g., the first level (individual subject level), second level (intragroup level of subjects within a certain dataset) and third level (intergroup level of subjects across different datasets), based only on the feature maps extracted from the fMRI datasets. The FMICA was presented as a hierarchical framework, which effectively made ICA and constrained ICA as a whole to identify the BFNs from the feature maps. The simulated and real experimental results demonstrated that FMICA had the excellent ability to identify the intergroup BFNs and to characterize subject-specific and group-specific difference of BFNs from the independent component feature maps, which sharply reduced the size of fMRI datasets. Compared with traditional ICAs, FMICA as a more generalized framework could efficiently and simultaneously identify the variant BFNs at the subject-specific, intragroup, intragroup-specific and intergroup levels, implying that FMICA was able to handle big neuroimaging datasets in neuroscience research. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nBlood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used as an effective neuroimaging tool to study functional connectivity, which can reveal the neural correlates of cognitive processes, among multiple cortical brain regions (Biswal et al.,  ,  ; Kawashima et al.,  ; Greicius et al.,  ; Yang et al.,  ; Shi et al.,  ). A recent research interest in the literature is to study functional connectivity at multiple levels using fMRI technique (Yeo et al.,  ), and for this purpose a variety of well-known methods have been utilized, e.g., general linear model (GLM; Friston et al.,  ; Bagarinao et al.,  ), clustering methods (Golay et al.,  ; Fadili et al.,  ; Cordes et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ; Ren et al.,  ; Tang et al.,  ), principal/independent component analysis (PCA/ICA; McKeown et al.,  ; Biswal and Ulmer,  ; Baumgartner et al.,  ; Kiviniemi et al.,  ; Beckmann and Smith,  ), sparse dictionary learning (Georgiev et al.,  ; Lv et al.,  , ; Wang et al.,  ), etc. As a representative of the model-based methods, GLM requires a prior knowledge of design matrix. Therefore, GLM is not able to detect intrinsic brain functional networks (BFNs) at the resting state where no design matrix is available. On the contrary, since no prior knowledge on the spatial or temporal pattern prior of the BFNs is required, the data-driven methods are more widely used in functional connectivity study. Examples of such data-driven methods include spatial ICA (McKeown et al.,  ) and temporal ICA (Biswal and Ulmer,  ), assuming the spatial and temporal independence, respectively, while probabilistic ICA (PICA) carries out a probabilistic modeling, to achieve an asymptotically unique decomposition of the fMRI data (Beckmann and Smith,  ). Other ICA methods for fMRI data analysis include an approach making use of spatial regularity of sources (Valente et al.,  ), and the models combining the sparsity and the mutual independence of components (Calhoun et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ,  ), to improve the accuracy of the estimated brain sources. \n\nIn order to investigate the commonality of the functional connectivity inferred by ICAs across a group of subjects, roughly five group analysis methods have been developed by many researchers (Calhoun and Adali,  ). The first group analysis method performs ICA on the average of the fMRI data across all subjects, with the underlying assumption that all subjects have common time courses (TCs) and spatial maps (SMs; Schmithorst and Holland,  ). The second method, temporal concatenation group ICA model (TCGICA), performs ICA on the temporal concatenation of the fMRI data for all subjects, which allows for unique TCs for each subject but assumes common group SMs (Calhoun et al.,  ). The third one was spatial concatenation group ICA model (SCGICA), which allows for unique SMs but assumes common TCs (Svens\u00e9n et al.,  ). However, for most resting-state fMRI functional connectivity studies, SCGICA does not perform so well as TCGICA (Schmithorst and Holland,  ), possibly because the assumption of the unique time course across subjects, is more appropriate than the common-SM assumption. The fourth group ICA method called tensor-ICA concatenates the multi-subject fMRI data along a separate third dimension, and estimates a single spatial, temporal, and subject-specific mode for each component to attempt to capture a multidimensional structure of the data (Beckmann and Smith,  ), with the assumption of both temporal and spatial consistency across the subjects. The fifth group analysis approach, makes a   post-hoc   analysis of the single-subject ICAs, to combine the components into groups by spatial correlation (Sch\u00f6pf et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ), self-organized clustering (Esposito et al.,  ), or retrospective matching of the components (Langers,  ). Additionally, by incorporating the intragroup sources as a priori of ICA model, called ICA-R (ICA with references; Lu and Rajapakse,  ; Shi et al.,  ), it is expected to obtain the more accurate subject-specific brain sources. For example, a novel group information guided ICA model (GIG-ICA) with the spatial reference of the intragroup sources generated by TCGICA (Calhoun et al.,  ) was able to extract more accurate subject-specific brain sources than the traditional ICA (Du and Fan,  ). \n\nThough the ICA or ICA-based models have been widely used to analyze the fMRI data, the aforementioned methods have the many kinds of deficiencies. For example, the multi-step PCA operations in TCGICA, SCGICA and GIG-ICA for data reduction, possibly eliminate the subtle signals (Cordes and Nandy,  ), which likely is not quite proper for handling the big neuroimaging data; since tensor ICA assumes common TCs among subjects, it is inappropriate for when they are different, such as in a resting-state study or when events are randomized between subjects; the single-subject ICAs also have the disadvantage that since the data are noisy, the components might not be necessarily unmixed in the same way for all subjects. Moreover, to our knowledge, these methods are just applied in BFNs identification at individual or/and intragroup levels, and there is a need to further investigate BFNs identification at intragroup-specific and intergroup levels, especially across the multiple fMRI datasets with different acquisition parameters such as variant time of repetition (TR) and different kinds of scanners. In this study, a generalized feature-map based ICA model (FMICA) is proposed to address the aforementioned deficiencies, which can be used to analyze the big fMRI datasets at individual, intragroup and intergroup levels. \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Theory and methods of FMICA are firstly presented in the next section, and followed by the description of the experimental designs and a subsequent section on BFN identification ability validation using both the simulation data and real fMRI datasets of task and rest at the subject-specific, intragroup and intergroup levels. Results and discussions are then presented, followed by final conclusions related to the advantages and limitations of FMICA. \n\n\n## Theory and methods \n  \nIn this section, the related theory of ICA and ICA-R is presented, followed by the detailed procedures of FMICA and some key issues in FMICA implementation. \n\n### BFNs extraction and ICA/ICA-R \n  \nThe BFNs extraction has been formulated as a source separation problem, based on the functional integration property of the brain (McKeown et al.,  ; Du and Fan,  ; Shi et al.,  ). This source separation problem can usually be divided into blind source separation (BSS) and semi-blind source separation (SBSS), depending on whether the prior is given or not. With the respect to ICA model, as a representative of BSS, it is assumed that the observed fMRI mixtures (denoted as   X  ) are linearly mixed by a set of non-Gaussian sources, namely BFNs (denoted as   S  ), which can be formulated as \n\nThe goal of ICA is to estimate an unmixing matrix   W  , such that the estimated sources   Y   computed by the following equation are good approximation of the true sources   S  : \n\nTo solve Equation (1), many ICA algorithms have been proposed, e.g., the commonly used Infomax (Bell and Sejnowski,  ) and FastICA (Hyv\u00e4rinen and Oja,  ). \n\nICA-R model of SBSS incorporates the prior spatial reference (denoted as   r  ), and can be modeled in a constrained ICA framework, to the following constrained optimization problem \n\nwhere   J  (  y  ) is the contrast function of a standard ICA algorithm, and   g  (  y  ) = \u03b5(  y, r  )\u2212\u03be, with \u03b5(  y, r  ) denotes the closeness between   y   (the estimated BFN) and the reference signal   r  , and \u03be signifies a threshold parameter used to restrain the distance between   y   and   r  . To solve Equation (3), the Lagrange multiplier method can be utilized to search for the solution using Newton-like learning (Lu and Rajapakse,  ), fixed-point learning (Lin et al.,  ), or multi-object optimization (Du and Fan,  ). \n\n\n### FMICA \n  \nSupposing that there are   m   scanned fMRI datasets, i.e., Dataset , 1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m  , the fMRI data of subject   i   in Dataset  is denoted as  , where 1 \u2264   i   \u2264   n  , 1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m  , and   n   signifying the subject number in Dataset . As described in Figure  , the FMICA model mainly consists of three levels of ICA decomposition and two re-estimation of group-specific and subject-specific feature maps using ICA-R: (1) the first (or single-subject) level ICA decomposition on   to obtain the feature maps, i.e., independent components  , where 1 \u2264   i   \u2264   n   and 1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m  ; (2) the second (or intragroup) level ICA decomposition on the aggregated feature maps, i.e.,   for Dataset , to obtain the feature maps at intragroup level, i.e.,   GICS   for Dataset , 1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m  ; (3) the third (or intergroup) level ICA decomposition on the aggregated feature maps across the datasets (Dataset , 1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m  ), i.e.,  , to extract the intergroup feature maps across the different datasets, i.e.,  ; (4) the ICA-R algorithm first runs on the   GICS   regrading Dataset  (1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m  ) to extract the correspondingly intragroup-specific feature maps, i.e.,  , then on the   regarding   (1 \u2264   i   \u2264   n  , 1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m  ) to obtain the correspondingly subject-specific featured maps (denoted as  ). \n  \nFramework of FMICA. \n  \nSpecifically, in order to make the last procedure in FMICA more apparent, the corresponding details are described in the following. On the one hand, for extracting the intragroup-specific feature maps, i.e.,  , 1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m  , the ICA-R algorithm (Du and Fan,  ) is implemented on each   GICS  , where the correspondingly intergroup feature maps   are used as the spatial references. On the other hand, in order to extract the subject-specific feature maps ( ) corresponding to the subject data  , 1 \u2264   i   \u2264   n  , and 1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m  , the similar ICA-R procedure with spatial reference is implemented on each  . It is noteworthy that the spatial references may have two choices: the intergroup feature maps   or the corresponding intragroup-specifc feature maps  . Repeating the above procedure for Dataset  (1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m  ), all the corresponding intragroup-specific   and subject-specific feature maps   (1 \u2264   i   \u2264   n  ) are retrieved. However, when the number of the involved datasets is <2, i.e.,   m   = 1, the third level ICA decomposition procedure is not implemented, and both the intergroup and intragroup-specific feature maps are not generated. Facing this situation, the subject-specific feature maps ( ) are also obtained by ICA-R, where the intragoup feature maps (  GICS  ) determined by the second level ICA decomposition procedure are used as the required spatial references. \n\nFurther, the corresponding statistical parametrical maps (SPMs) for  ,  ,  , and   GICS   (1 \u2264   i   \u2264   n   and 1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m  ) are obtained by the z-score transformation, where the BFNs are generated by threshing the corresponding SPMs with cluster size controlling. \n\nFinally, in FMICA, it is worthy of noting that the intragroup or intergroup BFNs are identified by the second or third level ICA decomposition procedure, while the intragroup-specific or subject-specific BFNs are both identified by ICA-R procedure using the ones at the intragroup or intergroup level as references. It is expected that the BFNs at the intergroup, intragroup-specific and subject-specific levels, have some degree of similarity to each other in spatial distribution, but orderly capture the commonness across different groups, the specific activation parts of the spatial distribution within a certain group and within a single subject data. In a word, for a given intergroup BFN, the corresponding intragroup-specific or subject-specific one belongs to the same kind of BFN, but captures the group-specific or subject-specific difference in spatial distribution of BFN. \n\nBased on the above description, FMICA is a quite generalized framework using feature maps, which is effective to capture the common BFNs (i.e.,  ,   GICS  ), subject-specific ones (i.e.,  ) and intragroup-specific ones (i.e.,  ). This implies that FMICA can be used to not only explore the subject-specific differences within a group, but also to reveal the intragroup-specific differences across the multiple datasets. \n\n\n### Some key points in FMICA implementation \n  \nWith respect to the FMICA implementation, the number of independent components (IC) in ICA decomposition at different levels should be first addressed. For the first level ICA decomposition procedure (depicted in Figure  ), the Laplace approximation (Minka,  ) previously used in probabilistic ICA for fMRI data analysis (Beckmann and Smith,  ) is used to estimate the components number for each single-subject fMRI data; for the second level ICA decomposition, the mean order corresponding to all subjects within the same dataset is used, while the average order is usually used as the number of intragroup level components in TCGICA (Calhoun et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ) implemented in the GIFT software ( ); for the third level ICA decomposition, the average number of components in   GICS  , 1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m   is used due to the situation of the different session scans of the same subjects under the same condition (for example, Experiment 2 of Section Experimental Designs); otherwise, the stability measure retrieved by ICASSO (Himberg et al.,  ) is used to determine the optimal components number, where ICASSO runs from the minimum number (i.e., min{  x  |  x   = #(  GICS  ), 1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m  }) to the maximum one (i.e., max{  x  |  x   = #(  GICS  ), 1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m  }) to obtain the stability values under different order number. Specifically, #() is an operation of obtaining the components number of the intragroup feature maps   GICS  , 1 \u2264   k   \u2264   m   (for example, Experiment 3 of Section Experimental Designs). Moreover, in this research, FMICA takes advantage of the FastICA (Hyv\u00e4rinen and Oja,  ) and GIG-ICA (Du and Fan,  ), to perform the ICA decomposition and ICA-R decomposition, respectively. Additionally, since the performance of ICA-R depends on the accuracy of the spatial references (Du and Fan,  ; Wang et al.,  ; Shi et al.,  ), slightly thresholded feature maps which are more similar to the real activated BFNs are used as spatial references, where the corresponding z threshold value is set to 1.0 empirically. Finally, the z-threshold value and the cluster size threshold are set to 2.0 and 10 voxels, respectively, to obtain the ultimate BFNs. \n\n\n\n## Experimental tests \n  \nIn this section, the efficacy of the proposed FMICA model, was validated on the simulation data, task-related fMRI data and resting-state fMRI data. The details of the designed experiments were presented as follows. \n\n### Experimental datasets \n  \n#### Simulation dataset \n  \nThe SimTB toolbox ( ; Allen et al.,  ; Erhardt et al.,  ) was used to generate simulation dataset including 20 subjects. Each subject data was with V = 148 \u00d7 148 voxels, 12 spatial sources and 120 time points at TR = 2 s (s). The baseline intensity was set to 800, and the baseline map was shown in Figure  . Each source, depicted in Figure  , represented a spatial pattern that underwent certain activation over time. Two sources (10 and 12) shared task-related modulation in addition to having unique fluctuations. For source 10, the strength of task-modulation (expressed as the ratio between task event amplitude and unique event amplitude) was set to 4, while task-relatedness was smaller for source 12, set to 2. Task-modulation was introduced with a block design (24 s on, 24 s off, five blocks), convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function to simulate the slow dynamics of the vascular response (Friston et al.,  ). Activation for the other 10 sources was described solely unique hemodynamic fluctuations with no task-related variation. All sources had unique events that occurred with a probability of 0.2 at each TR. For task-modulated sources (10 and 12), unique events were added with smaller amplitudes (0.2 and 0.4, respectively). For sources not of interest (no task modulation), the unique amplitude was 1. For all sources, the percent signal change was centered at 3 with a standard deviation of 0.25. Additive noise was included to reach a specified contrast-to-noise ratio of 1. The time courses corresponding to the simulated 12 sources were depicted in Figure  . To simulate the subject-specific variations in spatial domain, modifications such as translation, rotation, expansion, and contraction, were also randomly added to each source of each subject, where the corresponding parameters were depicted in Figure  . \n\n\n#### Visual task dataset \n  \nSix subjects (4 males and 2 females) took part in this visual task experiment, all informed about the purpose of this study and all the participants included in this study provided written informed consent according to procedures approved by the IRB of East China Normal University (ECNU). The designed visual paradigm was a two-states (  OFF, ON  ) \u00d7 3 block design with a duration of 40 s. At the \u201cON\u201d state, visual stimulus was corresponding to a radial blue/yellow checkerboard, reversing at 7 Hz. While at the \u201cOFF\u201d state, the participants were required to focus on the cross presented at the center of the screen. The BOLD fMRI data were acquired in the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance of ECNU, on a Siemens 3.0 Tesla scanner with a gradient echo EPI with 36 slices providing whole-brain coverage, TR = 2.0 s, scan resolution = 64 \u00d7 64, in-plane resolution = 3.75 \u00d7 3.75 mm; the slice thickness was 4 mm; and the slice gap was 1 mm. This dataset was also used in our previous study (Ren et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Test-retest task-related datasets for motor, language, and spatial attention \n  \nThis test-retest fMRI datasets for motor, language and spatial attention functions were downloaded from the openfmri website ( ; Gorgolewski et al.,  ). Three task-related fMRI time series (motor, covert verb generation, and landmark tasks) were selected to validate our proposed FMICA model. Ten healthy subjects (median age 52.5 years, min = 50, max = 58) included four males and six females, of which three were left-handed and seven right-handed. Each subject was scanned twice, either 2 (eight subjects) or 3 (two subjects) days apart. All subjects were provided with the written informed consent and this study was approved by South East Scotland Research Ethics Committee 01. The fMRI data acquisition parameters were set as follows: GE Signa HDxt 1.5T MRI scanner, FOV = 256 \u00d7 256 mm, in-plane matrix = 64 \u00d7 64, slice thickness = 4 mm, slice number = 30, TR = 2.5 s, flip angle = 90\u00b0. The number of volumes in time series regarding the motor, covert verb generation and landmark tasks were 173, 184, and 238, respectively. For the convenience of description, the motor, covert verb generation and landmark tasks were denoted as Task1, Task2, and Task3, respectively. \n\n\n#### Test-retest NYU resting-state datasets \n  \nThe test-retest resting-state fMRI datasets with 25 normal participants were drawn from the Human Connectome Project ( ; Zuo et al.,  ). All the participants included in this study were provided with written informed consent according to procedures approved by the IRB of New York University (NYU). Also, the fMRI data were collected according to protocols approved by the institutional review boards of NYU and the NYU School of Medicine. Each participant was scanned three times at rest by a Siemens Allegra 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner and the fMRI data for each subject consisted of 197 contiguous EPI functional volumes (TR = 2 s, TE = 25 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, slice number = 39, matrix = 64 \u00d7 64, FOV = 192 \u00d7 192 mm , acquisition voxel size = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm ). Data of sessions 2 and 3 were collected 5\u201316 months (mean 11 \u00b1 4 months) after session 1 with an interval of 45 min. A high-resolution T1-weighted magnetization prepared gradient echo sequence was also obtained for each participant (MPRAGE, TR = 2.5 ms, TE = 4.35 ms, TI = 900 ms, flip angle = 8\u00b0, slice number = 176, FOV = 256 \u00d7 256 mm ). \n\n\n\n### Data preprocessing \n  \nAll computations of this study were performed on a personal computer with intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3210M 2.5 GHz CPU and 4 GB RAM. The operation system platform was Windows 7. All steps for preprocessing or processing were run on the Matlab platform (Matlab 2012b, Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA, USA). \n\nNo preprocessing step was involved for the simulation dataset; For the other real data, the widely used DPARSF (Yan and Zang,  ) batch processing pipeline with embedding SPM8 software ( ) was used to perform the preprocessing operations including slice-timing, motion correction, spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) EPI template and spatial smoothing with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) equal to 6 mm. Specifically, considering magnetization equilibrium, the first ten volumes were discarded for the test-retest NYU datasets. For the task-related datasets, no first volumes were discarded. \n\nThe z threshold of the z-scored SPMs from all the real fMRI datasets was set to 2.0, and the least active cluster size was set to 10 voxels. The BFNs were displayed by the MRIcroN software ( ), and their locations were assessed by the PickAtlas toolbox (Maldjian et al.,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Experimental designs \n  \nThree kinds of experiments were designed to validate the effectiveness of FMICA in this study. \n\nExperiment 1: the simulation dataset with only one session was used to validate effectiveness of FMICA in two aspects, i.e., the BFN identification ability at the subject-specific and intragroup levels. Specifically, the third level ICA step was not involved in this experiment. The corresponding pipeline consisted of three procedures: the first level ICA on simulation dataset for obtaining the initial FMs (ICs), the second level ICA for extracting the second level (or intragroup) FMs and the ICA-R procedure using the intragroup FMs as the references for obtaining the subject-specific BFNs, respectively. \n\nExperiment 2: the NYU resting-state datasets with three sessions were used to validate effectiveness of FMICA in three aspects, i.e., the BFN identification ability at the subject-specific, intragroup-specific and intergroup levels. The corresponding pipeline consisted of the following steps: the first level ICA on fMRI datasets of each rest session for obtaining the initial FMs, the second level ICA for extracting the second level FMs, the third level ICA for obtaining the intergroup FMs and the ICA-R using the intergroup FMs as the references for obtaining the intragroup-specific and subject-specific FMs, respectively. \n\nExperiment 3: the ability of capturing the group difference of intrinsic BFNs across the multiple kinds of datasets using FMICA was validated using a combination of the test-retest NYU resting-state datasets, the test-retest task-related datasets for motor, language, and spatial attention and the visual task dataset. The corresponding pipeline consisted of the following steps: the first level ICA on each aforementioned dataset for obtaining the initial FMs, the second level ICA for extracting the intragroup FMs, the third level ICA for retrieving the intergroup FMs and the ICA-R procedure using the intergroup FMs as the references for obtaining the intragroup-specific FMs. \n\n\n\n## Results and analysis \n  \n### Results of experiment 1 \n  \nAccording to Experiment 1, the BFN detection ability of FMICA at the subject-specific and intragroup levels was designed to be validated on the simulation dataset. The order in both first (individual) and second (intragroup) level ICA decomposition was set to 13 (twelve designed sources and one background source). Firstly, the 12 sources determined by FMICA at intragroup level were displayed in Figure  , which were highly approximate to the simulated ground truth sources. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the 12 estimated intragroup sources and the corresponding 12 ground truth sources were 0.9783, 0.9672, 0.989, 0.9858, 0.9634, 0.9687, 0.9687, 0.9877, 0.9717, 0.9670, 0.9868, and 0.9703, respectively, quantitatively implying the effectiveness of FMICA in the intragroup BFNs identification. Moreover, in order to investigate the intragroup BFNs estimation from the different ratios of the retained ICA components of the intragroup level to that of the individual level, FMICA was performed with a variety of such intragroup-to-individual ratios on the simulation dataset to obtain the intragroup-level BFNs, and then the mean and standard deviation (std) values of Pearson correlation coefficients between the estimated intragroup sources and the corresponding ground truth sources at each run were calculated. As shown in Table  , from which, one could draw a conclusion that increasing the number of retained components at the individual level had no effect on performance, while greatly increasing the number of retained components at intragroup level had a certain degree of negative impact on the estimated intragroup sources, possibly due to the over-spilt effects in ICA decomposition in the simulation dataset. Table   also demonstrated that using the 13 components in both first-level and second-level ICA exhibited good BFNs identification performance in this simulation dataset. \n  \nThe simulated ground truth sources and the intragroup sources estimated by FMICA. \n  \nThe subject-specific BFNs for each simulated subject were also estimated by FMICA, and then the correlation coefficients between these estimated subject-specific BFNs and the corresponding ground truth sources for each subject were also calculated, with the mean correlation coefficient across the 12 sources for each subject denoted as its subject-specific BFNs identification accuracy, which was compared to those of the traditional ICA model, demonstrating superior subject-specific BFNs identification ability as shown in Figure  . \n  \nThe comparative curves of spatial correlation regarding the subject-specific sources identified by ICA and FMICA, respectively, for the simulated 20 subjects on simulation dataset. \n  \n\n### Results of experiment 2 \n  \nIn this experiment, the test-retest NYU resting-state datasets with three sessions were used to validate effectiveness of the proposed FMICA model on identifying the BFNs at the intergroup, intragroup-specific, and subject-specific levels. At the subject-specific level, compared to the intrinsic BFNs from different subjects, the intrinsic BFNs originated from the different sessions of the same subject should be more correlated. Moreover, the intragroup-specific intrinsic BFNs from different sessions should be also highly correlated with each other due to the high reproducibility of the intrinsic BFNs (Shehzad et al.,  ; Zuo et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). \n\nEighteen intrinsic BFNs at the intergroup and intragroup-specific levels for the resting session 1 (S1), session 2 (S2), and session 3 (S3) were selected visually by the experts from the estimated components by FMICA, as displayed in Figure  , respectively, with the involved Talairach Daemon (TD) lobes, Brodmann areas, Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas regions, and the representative MNI coordinates, presented in Table  . The components IC1-IC4 were referred to the well-known default mode network (DMN; Raichle et al.,  ; Damoiseaux et al.,  ; De Luca et al.,  ), which were divided into four sub-networks (Zuo et al.,  ); IC5, IC6, IC7, and IC10 were called the auditory network, predominant visual network, lateral visual network, and sensorimotor network, respectively (Beckmann et al.,  ; Damoiseaux et al.,  ; De Luca et al.,  ; Sch\u00f6pf et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ); IC8 and IC9 were involved with the working memory function related brain regions (Wang et al.,  ,  ; Iraji et al.,  ); IC11 and IC12 involved dorsal parietal and lateral prefrontal cortex, which were two split separate components of a dorsal pathway network (Damoiseaux et al.,  ; Sch\u00f6pf et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ,  ); IC13 was the salience network as reported by Menon and Uddin ( ) and Uddin ( ); IC14 was the basal ganglia network, involving mainly caudate nucleus and putamen (Iraji et al.,  ); IC15 involved the cerebellum posterior lobe and a portion of calcarine area in the occipital lobe; IC16 was located at the brainstem and cerebellum, e.g., cerebellar vermis; IC17 involved mainly brodmann areas 47 and 34, e.g., the superior temporal pole; IC18 was located at a portion of the limic and frontal cortex, e.g., hippocampus, some areas of superior frontal gyrus, etc. The successful identification of the aforementioned well-known intrisic BFNs at the intergroup and intragroup-specific levels demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed FMICA model. \n  \nThe spatial map distribution of the intrinsic BFNs at the intergroup and intragroup-specific levels on test-retest resting-state datasets: the first column depicted the intergroup intrinsic BFNs from the three rest sessions; the second, third, and fourth columns displayed the intragroup-specific intrinsic BFNs from the first (S1), second (S2), and third (S3) rest session, respectively. \n    \nThe location information of the 18 intrinsic BFNs from the test-retest resting-state datasets shown in Figure  : the MNI coordinates (in mm), the involved brain lobes, Brodmann areas and AAL atlas regions for each network. \n  \nFrom Figure  , it could be observed that the intrinsic BFNs at the intragroup-specific level from each session were quite approximate to the corresponding ones at the intergroup level. Meanwhile, three pairs of mutual correlations among the intragroup-specific BFNs estimated from the three sessions, were calculated, as shown in Figure  , from which high correlations could be clearly observed, demonstrating great reproducibility of the intrinsic BFNs across the sessions. \n  \nThe spatial map correlation curves among the correspondingly intragroup-specific intrinsic BFNs identified by FMICA from the first (S1), second (S2), and third (S3) session of resting-state datasets, respectively. \n  \nAt the subject-specific level, the BFNs identified by FMICA were compared among sessions of the same subject and among different subjects, respectively, and mean correlation coefficients between pairs of BFNs under comparison for each subject were shown in Figure  , where Figures   were for across-sessions and across-subjects comparison, respectively. Similar to FMICA, the BFNs identified by the first level ICA were also compared among sessions of the same subject and among different subjects, respectively, and mean correlation coefficients between pairs of BFNs under comparison for each subject were also shown in Figures   for across-sessions and across-subjects comparison, respectively. It was worth noting that the 18 intrinsic BFNs at the intergroup level were used as the templates to match the best ones from the individual FMs generated by the first level ICA decomposition on each session data of each subject, aiming at overcoming the random order of the components. Moreover, based on the contrast values presented in Figures  , and the contrast ones in Figures  , two sample   T-  tests with significance level equal to 0.05 were implemented, respectively, where the mean value (0.5644, marked in Figure  ) of all points in Figure   was significantly larger than the one (0.3168, marked in Figure  ) of all points in Figure   with p value equal to 6.1630 \u00d7 e , and the mean value (0.3591, in Figure  ) of all points in Figure   was also significantly larger than the one (0.1853, marked in Figure  ) of all points in Figure   with   p   value equal to 2.1511 \u00d7 e . The mean values of the points in Figures   corresponding to the first level ICA were relatively small, and this was possibly due to that some BFNs could be identified at the intergroup level, but not separated at the single subject level by the traditional ICA. However, the ICA-R re-estimation procedure in FMICA could identify most of BFNs at the single subject level, demonstrating that the proposed FMICA could identify the subject-specific BFNs more effectively than the traditional ICA did. \n  \nThe correlation bar chart of 18 intrinsic BFNs against 25 subjects on the test-retest resting-state datasets:   (A)   denoted the mean across-sessions correlation among the intrinsic BFNs estimated by FMICA for the different sessions of the same subject;   (B)   denoted the mean across-subjects correlation among the intrinsic BFNs estimated by FMICA for the different subjects;   (C)   denoted the mean across-sessions correlation among the intrinsic BFNs estimated by FastICA for the different sessions of the same subject;   (D)   denoted the mean across-subjects correlation among the intrinsic BFNs estimated by FastICA for the different subjects. \n  \nTo intuitively compare the performance between the proposed FMICA and the traditional ICA, the spatial maps of IC1 (DMN) identified by FMICA and FastICA for all three sessions of the first four subjects (for space limitation) as shown in Figures  , respectively, were taken as an example, from which it was obvious that the DMNs identified by FMICA had higher across-sessions than across-subjects consistency and much higher both across-sessions and across-subjects consistency compared to the results of FastICA, implying that FMICA had higher subject-specific BFNs identification capability than traditional ICA. \n  \nThe individual DMNs identified by FMICA and FastICA on the test-retest resting-state fMRI datasets with respect to four examplars:   (A)   subject-specific DMNs identified by FMICA;   (B)   subject-specific DMNs identified by FastICA. \n  \nIn summary, results from the test-retest resting-state datasets demonstrated that the proposed FMICA model had high BFN identification capability at intergroup, intragroup-specific and subject-specific levels. \n\n\n### Results of experiment 3 \n  \nIn this experiment, the intergroup and intragroup-specific analysis ability of FMICA was further validated by combining the test-retest resting-state datasets, the test-retest task-related datasets for motor, language and spatial attention (i.e., Task1, Task2, and Task3) and the visual task dataset. Namely, there were ten datasets as the input of FMICA, i.e., the resting-state datasets with three sessions, three test-retest task-related datasets (i.e., Task1, Task2, and Task3) with two sessions and the visual task dataset with one session. In this experiment, as described in Section Some Key Points in FMICA Implementation, the ICASSO method was used to determine the optimal order for the intergroup-level analysis based on the stability measure of the estimated components for each order, as shown in Figure  , demonstrating that the estimated components had the highest mean/median stability and relatively small values of standard deviation (STD) and inter-quartile range (IQR), when the order was equal to 57. Therefore, the order was set to 57 in Experiment 3. \n\nIntragroup-specific BFNs for each of the 10 datasets and the corresponding intergroup BFNs, selected visually by the experts from the estimated components by FMICA, were showed in Figure   for the first five BFNs due to space limitation, and results for the remaining 25 BFNs were shown in Figure  . The TD lobes, Brodmann areas, AAL regions and the representative MNI coordinates involved in these BFNs, were recorded in Table  . It could be observed that most of the intrinsic BFNs extracted in Experiment 2 had high reproducibility in Experiment 3, and better across-sessions than across-datasets consistency of the BFNs was also observed. Correlation analysis was performed to quantify such consistency in various cases. Firstly, mean and std values of correlation coefficients among the intragroup-specific BFNs from different sessions of the resting-state datasets under the same condition (e.g., session 1 and session 2 of resting-state datasets), were calculated and presented in Figure  , demonstrating a high mean correlation of 0.8464 and thus implying high across-sessions reproducibility of the BFNs in resting-state datasets (Wang et al.,  ). Then, the same correlation analysis were performed across the test-retest task datasets of Tasks 1, 2, and 3 from the same subjects, with results presented in Figure  , showing also a high mean correlation of 0.8314 and thus implying across-tasks similarity of the intrinsic functional connectivity architecture (Finn et al.,  ). Finally, correlation analysis were performed on completely different kinds of datasets sharing neither sessions nor tasks, with results shown in Figure  , indicating a low correlation of 0.5814 inferior to that in Figures   and thus demonstrating that the proposed FMICA was able to effectively capture the differences of intragroup BFNs across the different kinds of datasets. \n  \nThe spatial map distribution of first five BFNs at the intergroup and intragroup-specific levels in Experiment 3: each column depicted a BFN at the intergroup and intragroup-specific levels; Rest_S i denoted the ith session of test-retest resting-state datasets; Task i_S j denoted the jth session of Task i from the test-retest task-related datasets; Visual denoted the visual task dataset. \n    \nThe spatial correlation curves of the intragroup-specific BFNs generated by FMICA among the test-retest resting-state datasets, three test-retest task-related datasets and visual task dataset:   (A)   the spatial map correlation curves among the intragroup-specific BFNs from the same kinds of datasets with different sessions;   (B)   the spatial map correlation curves among the intragroup-specific BFNs with respect to the test-retest task-related datasets;   (C)   the spatial map correlation curves among the intragroup-specific intrinsic BFNs from different kinds of datasets. \n  \nTo summarize, it could be stated that the proposed FMICA was effective for the intergroup and intragroup-specific analysis, and could characterize the group-specific difference. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this paper, a BFNs parcellation model based on feature maps, called FMICA, was proposed with demonstrated effectiveness. This FMICA consisted of four main procedures: (1) the first-level ICA decomposition to extract independent component feature maps for each dataset of each subject; (2) the second-level ICA decomposition to obtain the intragroup feature maps for each dataset; (3) the third-level ICA decomposition to acquire intergroup BFNs across multiple datasets; (4) the ICA-R decomposition to extract intragroup-specific BFNs and subject-specific BFNs based on intragroup feature maps and individual IC feature maps, respectively. On one hand, since FMICA used only the feature maps identified by the single-subject level ICA and the subsequent hierarchical processing steps were incorporated for multi-level analysis, it was able to effectively handle the big neuroimaging datasets with different acquisition parameters. On the other hand, the experimental results showed that FMICA had great capability for brain network identification at the subject-specific, intragroup, intragroup-specific and intergroup levels. For example, the results of Figures  ,  ,   demonstrated the FMICA's more effective identification ability of the subject-specific BFNs in contrast to the traditional ICA method; based on the results showed in Figure  , the intragroup-specific BFNs showed the better across-sessions than across-datasets consistency, while the intragroup-specific ones also uncovered group-specific difference in the spatial distribution compared to the intergroup ones (showed in Figure   and Figure  ). \n\n### Comparison with other feature-based ICA methods \n  \nIt was proposed to perform ICA analysis by summarizing fMRI data of each subject as a feature map and applying subsequently traditional ICA algorithms on these feature maps, where features could be the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) maps for resting-state data or T-statistic maps for task-related data, yielding BFNs strikingly similar to but slightly noisier than the results of spatiotemporal group ICA analysis (i.e., TCGICA; Calhoun and Allen,  ). Very recently, another novel feature-based ICA model using seed-based functional connectivity as summarizing features was proposed (Iraji et al.,  ), with performance highly depending on the choice of seeds. The proposed FMICA in this paper took spatial maps of the independent components of the subjects as feature maps for group analysis. FMICA could produce the comparable intragroup BFNs to the spatiotemporal-domain based group ICA, as shown in Figure  , implying that it was more effective than the first feature-based ICA model. Meanwhile, FMICA without the seed-based functional connectivity identification procedure was more flexible than the second feature-based ICA model, and it had extra unique advantages of identifying subject-specific, intragroup-specific and intergroup BFNs due to hierarchical processing incorporated in the model. \n\n\n### Limitations and future research \n  \nSingle-subject independent components were used as the input feature maps in the proposed FMICA model. However, edges and shapes of the feature-maps could be susceptible to the preprocessing steps in fMRI data analysis, such as the spatial smoothing with FWHM kernels of different size. Therefore, one future research topic on FMICA might be to develop a more robust model to deal with the effects of the preprocessing steps on the feature maps. \n\nSince brain activity at either resting or task states is non-stationary, and it is very important to characterize the dynamics of brain networks (Calhoun et al.,  ). Although static brain functional activity is considered in the current study, the FMICA has also the potential to provide new options to the investigation of the dynamic characteristics of brain networks. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn this study, we proposed a generalized feature-map based ICA model, named FMICA, which aimed at facing the ever-increasingly big neuroimaging datasets with diverse acquisition parameters. This proposed model was effective to characterize BFNs at the subject-specific, intragroup, intragroup-specific and intergroup levels. The success of FMICA also implied that the feature maps used as the single-subject representatives could not only reduce the high dimensions of the original fMRI data to a small one, but also capture the useful common and distinct properties embedded in each original data. In summary, this proposed FMICA was expected to have wide applications in neuroimaging neuroscience research, e.g., determining individual brain functional ROIs, characterizing differences of BFNs among individual subjects or among the contrast groups, etc. \n\n\n## Ethics statement \n  \nIn this study, all the participants included in this study of visual dataset, test-retest task-related datasets and test-retest NYU resting-state datasets provided written informed consent according to procedures approved by the IRB of East China Normal University (ECNU), South East Scotland Research Ethics Committee 01 and New York University (NYU), respectively.

{"text": "Pando-Naude, Victor and Barrios, Fernando A. and Alcauter, Sarael and Pasaye, Erick H. and Vase, Lene and Brattico, Elvira and Vuust, Peter and Garza-Villarreal, Eduardo A.\nSci Rep, 2019\n\n# Title\n\nFunctional connectivity of music-induced analgesia in fibromyalgia\n\n# Keywords\n\nChronic pain\nFibromyalgia\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nListening to self-chosen, pleasant and relaxing music reduces pain in fibromyalgia (FM), a chronic centralized pain condition. However, the neural correlates of this effect are fairly unknown. In our study, we wished to investigate the neural correlates of music-induced analgesia (MIA) in FM patients. To do this, we studied 20 FM patients and 20 matched healthy controls (HC) acquiring rs-fMRI with a 3T MRI scanner, and pain data before and after two 5-min auditory conditions: music and noise. We performed resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) seed-based correlation analyses (SCA) using pain and analgesia-related ROIs to determine the effects before and after the music intervention in FM and HC, and its correlation with pain reports. We found significant differences in baseline rs-FC between FM and HC. Both groups showed changes in rs-FC after the music condition. FM patients reported MIA that was significantly correlated with rs-FC decrease between the angular gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, and rs-FC increase between amygdala and middle frontal gyrus. These areas are related to autobiographical and limbic processes, and auditory attention, suggesting MIA may arise as a consequence of top-down modulation, probably originated by distraction, relaxation, positive emotion, or a combination of these mechanisms. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMusic-induced analgesia (MIA) is defined as the subjective reduction of pain perception after listening to music , and the effect has been reported in chronic pain conditions such as low back pain, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia . Endogenous pain inhibition depends on the descending pain modulatory system (DPMS), with areas involved such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) and rostral ventral medulla (RVM) . Thus, the possible neural mechanisms of MIA are suggested to be top-down through the DPMS, secondary to cognitive and emotional mechanisms such as distraction , familiarity , emotion , relaxation and reward . MIA may be then catalogued as a centralized type of analgesia, given that the effect seems to originate in the brain and not by peripheral nociceptive receptors . \n\nFibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain syndrome of unknown etiology that predominantly affects women, and is characterized by increased sensitivity to somatosensory nociception, and associated with other symptoms such as sleep disorders, stiffness, fatigue, anxiety, and depression . There is still no specific treatment for FM and conventional treatment can result in abuse of painkillers, which lead to other co-morbidities . FM patients seem to exhibit a decrease of central inhibition or facilitation of the nociceptive input in the DPMS , and thus are more sensitive to pain, as well as other types of sensory input such as noise . This seems to be a consequence of increased function of the pain pathways, increased membrane excitability and synaptic efficacy, as well as reduced neuronal inhibition . \n\nIn FM, studies have investigated morphological and functional characteristics of these patients using different neuroimaging techniques . Specifically, recent resting-state fMRI studies have found alterations in brain connectivity in FM patients , involving networks related to pain intensity and analgesia . FM patients have shown increased resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) of areas related to pain processing, and reduced connectivity in regions involved in pain inhibitory modulation . These findings include connectivity changes of areas such as insula, thalamus, amygdala, PAG, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, primary motor cortex, primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, basal ganglia, and prefrontal areas . Therefore, alterations in rs-FC in FM patients appear to involve not only areas related to pain processing (perception and modulation), but also related to somatomotor, executive, limbic, autobiographic, and integration processes. \n\nIn terms of MIA, there are no existing neuroimaging studies in acute or chronic pain, with the exception of our own previous study, where we showed MIA related to increased BOLD signal amplitude in the angular gyrus (AnG) in FM patients . Although the changes in amplitude were correlated with the pain self-report, the study did not include healthy controls to contrast changes in functional connectivity. Overall, if the mechanisms behind MIA are related to the DPMS, areas such as the ACC, PAG and INS should show rs-FC changes in FM patients. In this study, we wished to investigate rs-FC patterns of MIA in FM patients, compared to age and sex-matched healthy controls (HC), by means of pain self-report, rs-fMRI and seed-based correlation analyses on the rs-FC of a customized pain matrix. We hypothesized that (1) FM patients would show significant differences in rs-FC of areas related to pain processing at rest, and (2) the analgesic effect of music would be associated to changes in rs-FC of areas related to the DPMS in FM patients. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe study was conducted at the Instituto de Neurobiolog\u00eda of the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM Juriquilla, Queretaro, Mexico). A fibromyalgia group (FM, n\u2009=\u200920, age range\u2009=\u200922\u201370, mean\u2009=\u200946.4, SD\u2009=\u200912.4) and an age-matched control group (HC, n\u2009=\u200920, age range\u2009=\u200921\u201370, mean\u2009=\u200942.1, SD\u2009=\u200912.5) participated in this study. Given the difficulties of obtaining male participants with a complete diagnose of FM, and the fact that it affects predominantly women, our entire sample included only women. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation in the fMRI experiment is described in Table\u00a0 \u2009 .   \nParticipant selection criteria. \n  \nVRS, Verbal Rating Scale. \n  \n\nAll participants gave their consent verbally and in written form before the experiment. FM patients were asked not to intake painkillers at the day of testing only. The HC group were screened to ensure that they did not experience any type pain at the day of testing. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by Bioethics Committee of the Instituto de Neurobiolog\u00eda, UNAM. Patients received no compensation for participating in the study. \n\n\n### Design and paradigm \n  \nPart of the current data has been previously analyzed and published by Garza-Villarreal   et al  . , which showed that MIA related to increased BOLD signal amplitude in the angular gyrus (AnG) in FM patients by analyzing fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF). This method obtains differences in BOLD signal amplitude between conditions. In this new study, we included healthy controls to determine if the effect of music on the brain is in fact related to analgesia, and performed seed-based functional connectivity analyses of a pain-related matrix. Participants answered the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) , the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) , the Pain Self-Perception Scale (PSP) , and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)  before the MRI scanning, to establish clinical and behavioral differences between FM patients and HC. It must be noted that these scales were not used for diagnosis, only used to measure symptoms. \n\nTo evaluate pain while in the MRI scanner, pain intensity (PI) and pain unpleasantness (PU) were measured only in FM patients (Fig.\u00a0 ), using the verbal rating scale (VRS) (0\u2009=\u2009no pain, 10\u2009=\u2009worst pain possible) . PI refers to the sensory aspect of pain, whereas PU refers to the evaluative and emotional dimension of pain . PI and PU were measured immediately before and after each experimental condition. The experimental conditions consisted of five-minute long auditory tracks, either music or pink noise (control), presented while no imaging was acquired, with participants inside the MRI scanner. Prior to the study, participants provided a list of songs or artists that they would like to listen during the experiment. Songs had to be familiar, highly pleasant and slow paced. The slow pace was defined as a tempo of <120 beats per minute (bpm), determined by the researcher using a metronome. Pleasantness was reported by the participant using a 10-point verbal scale (0\u2009=\u2009unpleasant, 10\u2009=\u2009highly pleasant), and to be selected, the song had to be rated at least 9\u201310 points. When only the artist name was provided, the researcher chose the songs based on two fixed acoustic criteria: consonance (pleasantness), verbally reported by the participant, and slow tempo. We conducted a previous systematic review and meta-analysis  of publications that reported music-induced analgesia in chronic pain conditions, and we found a higher effect when participants choose familiar music to listen, making self-choice and familiarity important mechanisms of this effect. Pink noise was selected by a prior pilot study in which several types of noise were presented to healthy participants , and pleasantness ratings were obtained. Pink noise resulted as more neutral than other types of noise (i.e. white noise).   \nExperimental rs-fMRI Paradigm. Experimental conditions were pink noise and music. Image acquisitions were performed before and after each experimental condition, in which participants were instructed to stay alert with eyes opened and fixated on a white cross displayed on the center of a black background presented on a screen. Pain Intensity and Pain Unpleasantness was reported by fibromyalgia patients only, before and after each experimental condition. The washout condition was executed during the \u201cStructural Scan\u201d period. PINK NOISE, control condition; VRS, pain verbal rating scale; rs-fMRI, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging; +, fixation cross. \n  \n\nParticipants listened to the auditory stimuli inside the MRI scanner (Fig.\u00a0 ), a period in which no sequences were acquired to minimize unwanted noise. The order of the auditory stimulus presentation was counter-balanced across participants, to avoid any order effect. Auditory stimuli were presented using the NordicNeuroLab AS (Bergen, Norway) MRI-safe headphones. For each session, there were a total of four rs-fMRI acquisitions (rs-fMRI 1, rs-fMRI 2, rs-fMRI 3, rs-fMRI 4) lasting five minutes each, in which participants were instructed to stay alert with eyes opened and not to fixate on a cross presented on the screen. A wash-out condition was presented between the second and third functional acquisition, and consisted of watching a video documentary with sound (i.e., a biography of Bill Gates), period in which structural imaging was acquired (Fig.\u00a0 ). The purpose of the wash-out condition was to avoid analgesic or cognitive cross-over effects. Visual stimuli (fixation and wash-out condition) were presented in a screen projected through a mirror mounted on the MRI head coil, using the software VLC Media Player ( ). A total of eight conditions were defined for the statistical analysis: pre-control (Cpre), post-control (Cpos), pre-music (Mpre), and post-music (Mpos) for both groups (FM and HC). A baseline (BL) condition was defined as the first rs-fMRI sequence acquired by participant, and it was used to analyze differences in brain functional connectivity between groups (FM and HC) before the music intervention, and to select relevant brain areas to analyze the neural correlates of MIA. \n\n\n### Procedure \n  \nFM patients were recruited through a fibromyalgia support group and from the General Hospital of the Health Government Department (Hospital General de la Secretar\u00eda de Salud) both located in Queretaro, Mexico. HC were recruited using flyers placed in the Instituto de Neurobiolog\u00eda, and with the help of students and workers of the same institute. Potential participants were informed and interviewed by phone to make sure they met the inclusion criteria. After participants were confirmed to be eligible and accepted to participate in the study, they were asked for songs they would like to listen to during the study, that would fit the characteristics described in the previous section. Before the MRI scans, they were briefed about the study to make sure they understood the procedure and implications. Participants then answered the behavioral questionnaires described above. During the MRI scanning, participants in the FM group rated their spontaneous pain immediately before and after each auditory condition. The HC group experienced no pain; thus, pain was not measured. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nThe image acquisition was performed with a 3.0 Tesla GE Discovery MR750 scanner (HD, General Electric Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) and a commercial 32-channel head coil array. High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were obtained using the FSPGR BRAVO pulse sequence: plane orientation\u2009=\u2009sagittal, TR\u2009=\u20097.7\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20093.2\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200912\u00b0, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, FOV\u2009=\u2009256 mm , slice thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm, number of slices\u2009=\u2009168, gap\u2009=\u20090\u2009mm, slice order\u2009=\u2009interleaved, view order\u2009=\u2009bottom-up. A gradient echo sequence was used to collect rs-fMRI data using the following parameters: plane orientation\u2009=\u2009axial, TR\u2009=\u20093000\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200940\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, matrix\u2009=\u2009128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128, FOV\u2009=\u2009256 mm , slice thickness\u2009=\u20093\u2009mm, voxel size\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm, number of slices\u2009=\u200943, gap\u2009=\u20090\u2009mm, slice order\u2009=\u2009interleaved, view order\u2009=\u2009bottom-up. The total time for each rs-fMRI sequence was 5\u2009minutes with a total of 100 brain volumes acquired per run, with 4 runs per subject. During the scanning, patients were not given any instructions about the music or pink noise, but were instructed to stay alert, to keep their eyes open without thinking anything in particular. All images were saved in DICOM format, anonymized and converted to NIFTI format using dcm2nii from MRIcron . \n\n\n### Statistical analysis of questionnaires and pain measures \n  \nDescriptive and inferential statistics of data and plots were performed using R software  and the \u201cggplot2\u201d package of R . To establish behavioral differences between experimental groups (FM and HC), a two-tailed unpaired   t-student   test was performed on the results from pain self-perception, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression questionnaires. PI and PU scores of the FM group were not normally distributed, therefore, non-parametric two-tailed paired analyses were performed with the   Mann-Whitney Rank   test. This analysis was performed in the difference of variables \u0394PI (pre-post PI) and \u0394PU (pre-post PU) between the two experimental conditions (music and pink noise). \n\n\n### Functional connectivity analysis \n  \nThe rs-fMRI data was preprocessed and analyzed using the CONN Toolbox for Matlab . Structural and functional images were imported into CONN and the preprocessing pipeline included: realignment, slice-timing correction, structural segmentation and spatial normalization (simultaneous Gray/White/CSF segmentation and normalization to the MNI space), outlier detection (ART-based identification of outlier scans for scrubbing; subject motion correction\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009mm and global signal Z-value threshold\u2009=\u20093), and smoothing (spatial convolution with a Gaussian kernel with FWHM\u2009=\u20095\u2009mm). Nuisance variables were regressed out using the general lineal model. Signal timeseries were band-pass filtered between 0.008 and 0.09\u2009Hz. Nuisance variables included six motion variables, and principal components of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, a method referred as aCompCor . The aCompCor avoids artefactual anticorrelations introduced by global signal regression and reduces artifact by physiological signals. To evaluate resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) we performed seed-based correlation analysis (SCA). This analysis measures the correlation of the time-series of the BOLD signal (blood oxygen level dependent signal) of a specific region-of-interest (ROI) with the rest of the whole brain (seed-to-voxel approach). \n\nWe divided the analysis into four consecutive steps. For step-1 or \u201cseed definition\u201d, our seeds were created from 34 ROIs using fslmaths  with a 5-mm kernel sphere, each in MNI space. The ROIs were obtained from peak coordinates of several pain studies, both experimental and clinical , and cross-referenced with brain atlases (Harvard-Oxford atlas FSLview; Juelich Histological Atlas FSLview), and Neurosynth  using \u201cpain\u201d and \u201cchronic pain\u201d as search terms, to ensure the precision of the obtained coordinates. Most of the seeds were derived from the study by Cifre   et al  . , given that it showed for the first time a disrupted brain functional connectivity in FM patients. The seeds were located on the following brain regions on both hemispheres: anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), angular gyrus (AnG), amygdala (AMYG), primary auditory cortex (BA41), caudate (CAU), globus pallidus (GP), putamen (PUT), insula (INS), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), periaqueductal grey matter (PAG), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex (SI), secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), supplementary motor area (SMA), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and thalamus (THA) (Fig.\u00a0 , Supplementary Table\u00a0 ). Furthermore, we merged all 34 ROIs together to create an   a priori   brain mask using fslmerge , which concatenated all seeds into one single output. Because most of these regions, but not all, are part of the so-called pain network, we named this merged seed \u201cpain matrix\u201d. We performed seed-to-voxel whole-brain correlation analyses for both modalities: (1) the pain matrix and (2) by each seed independently. All rs-FC analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) at q\u2009=\u20090.05.   \nPain matrix rs-fMRI seed-based correlation analysis. (  a  ) 3D image of the pain matrix: ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; BA41, primary auditory cortex; AMYG, amygdala; AnG, angular gyrus; CAU, caudate; GP, globus pallidus; PUT, putamen; INS, insular cortex; mPFC, medial prefrontal cortex; PAG, periaqueductal gray matter; M1, primary motor cortex; SI, primary somatosensory cortex; SII, secondary somatosensory cortex; SMA, supplementary motor area; STS, superior temporal sulcus; THA, thalamus. (  b  ) Connectivity maps of the pain matrix for FM (left) and HC (right) respectively. We calculated the BOLD mean time-series of all 34 seeds into one single   a priori   brain mask, and correlated it with the rest of the whole brain. Colors show either positive (red\u2013yellow) or negative (blue\u2013light blue) correlations of the pain matrix. Image shows positive correlations of the pain matrix with the Default Mode Network (DMN), with areas such as mPFC, PCC, PCN, and AnG. \n  \n\nFor step-2 or \u201cbaseline rs-FC contrast\u201d, we compared the resulting correlation maps of only the baseline (BL) condition between groups (FM vs HC) using a general linear model (GLM, \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05) between-subjects design with the following covariates: age, years with FM diagnosis, and anxiety and depression symptoms. The rs-fMRI data for this analysis was taken from the participant\u2019s Cpre and Mpre conditions (before music, and before pink noise). The purpose of this was to identify specific areas already affected in FM that may change in relation to MIA. The seeds with significant differences in rs-FC between groups were included in step-3. \n\nFor step-3 or \u201crs-FC of MIA\u201d, we investigated the main effects of group (FM & HC), condition (music & pink noise) and time (pre- & post-test), and a 3-way interaction on rs-FC changes of the pain matrix. We conducted an GLM (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05), on a   post hoc   pain matrix that resulted from the step-2 analysis (BL). In a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092 ANOVA, we modeled the different conditions (8 conditions; FM_Cpre, FM_Cpos, FM_Mpre, FM_Mpos, HC_Cpre, HC_Cpos, HC_Mpre and HC_Mpos) and conducted 2-sided F-statistics to test main effects and interactions. Then, we conducted   post hoc   paired t-tests within each group to assess specific rs-FC changes from pre to post-conditions. \n\nFor step-4 or \u201ccorrelation of rs-FC and MIA\u201d, we determined if the analgesic effect of music correlated with rs-FC results in FM patients using \u0394PI and \u0394PU scores, along with the rs-FC contrast results of Mpre vs Mpos (\u0394rs-FC) values. The purpose of this analysis is to correlate subjective data (pain self-report) with objective data (rs-fMRI). All scores were transformed to Z-values and a two-tailed Pearson\u00b4s correlation analysis was performed, considering it significant at \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05. \n\n\n### Statement of significance \n  \nThis original article explores the neural correlates of music-induced analgesia in a prototypical chronic pain disorder such as fibromyalgia. Using state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques, we show that music reduces pain, and that the effect correlates with changes in brain functional connectivity of areas related to pain and analgesia. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Questionnaires and pain measures \n  \nAs expected and in accordance with previous FM behavioral studies, pain self-perception, pain catastrophizing, anxiety and depression were significantly different between FM and HC (Table\u00a0 ). The t-student test showed that patients with FM report greater pain self-perception (<0.001), pain catastrophizing (p\u2009<\u20090.001), anxiety (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and depression (p\u2009<\u20090.001) symptoms than HC. The Mann-Whitney Rank test showed that pink noise and music were significantly different in both \u0394PI (W\u2009=\u200960, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and \u0394PU (W\u2009=\u200965.5, p\u2009=\u20090.004). In other words, FM patients reported lower pain levels after listening to music, but not after listening to the pink noise. Pink noise produced a small increase of pain perception in FM patients (~1 point VRS), which was non- significant in both PI and PU (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nDescriptive and Inferential Statistics of Behavioral Questionnaires. \n  \nFM, fibromyalgia; HC, healthy controls; PCS, pain catastrophizing scale; PSP, pain self-perception scale; STAI, state-trait anxiety inventory; CES-D, center for epidemiologic studies depression scale. \n  \n\n\n### Functional connectivity \n  \n#### Baseline contrast: FM patients display altered rs-FC of the pain matrix \n  \nWe found baseline rs-FC differences of the pain matrix between FM patients and HC [F(2,38)\u2009=\u20098.33, p\u2009=\u20090.03], with no interactions with behavioral data (pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression). FM patients showed higher rs-FC between the pain matrix (34 merged ROIs) and left precuneus (PCN), left SFG, right MidFG, right PaCiG, and left PCC; and lower rs-FC with right INS, when compared with HC. The analyses by seed revealed that FM patients display higher rs-FC of the following: left ACC, left AnG, right GP, left GP, left mPFC, right PCC, left PCC, left THA; and lower rs-FC of the following: right ACC, left AMYG, left AnG, left GP, left INS, right SMA (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). These results showed a disrupted rs-FC of the pain matrix in FM patients, when compared with HC. In our study, covariates did not show any significant influence in the main contrasts thus, rs-FC alterations in FM patients seem to be independent of age, years with FM diagnosis, as well as anxiety and depression symptoms. A total of 12 seeds from the original 34 were significantly altered when comparing FM vs HC, thus, only these seeds were included in the step-3 (rs-FC of MIA) analysis.   \nBaseline Condition FM vs HC.

We conducted a GLM (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05), on a post hoc pain matrix that resulted from the baseline contrast (12 merged ROIs). In a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092 ANOVA, we modeled the different conditions (8 conditions; FM_Cpre, FM_Cpos, FM_Mpre, FM_Mpos, HC_Cpre, HC_Cpos, HC_Mpre and HC_Mpos) and conducted F-statistics to test main effects and interactions. The group main effect showed that FM display higher rs-FC of the pain matrix with left and right PCN, left INS, left PCC, and right AnG [F(8,152)\u2009=\u20094.47, p\u2009=\u2009<0.001]. Thus, FM patients and HC seem to process the experimental conditions in a different manner. The condition main effect showed that music has a significant effect on the pain matrix, with higher rs-FC of the pain matrix with right ACC [F(8,152)\u2009=\u20094.49, p\u2009=\u20090.02], when compared to pink noise. Thus, music and pink noise appear to display different connectivity patterns in the pain matrix of participants. The time main effect showed that the connectivity patterns were altered between time-points, possibly driven by rs-FC change in participants after listening to music [F(8,152)\u2009=\u20094.1, p\u2009=\u20090.02]. This effect was evidenced by higher rs-FC of the pain matrix with right AnG and right MidFG, and lower rs-FC of the pain matrix with right PaCiG and right PCN. Finally, we found a 3-way interaction between group, condition and time variables located in the right PCN [F(8,152)\u2009=\u20093.24, p\u2009=\u2009<0.001].   \nrs-FC of MIA in FM. The bars represent the effect size of each condition of rs-FC of the pain matrix. A 3-way interaction is obtained by main effect of group (FM vs HC), condition (music vs pink noise), and time (pre- vs post- test). FM patients rs-FC of the pain matrix is significantly different to that of HC. The experimental conditions have a different effect on rs-FC of the pain matrix in both groups and time points. The connectivity patterns before and after music, significantly differ in both groups, while pink noise has no significant effect. A 3-way interaction was found in the precuneus (see Table\u00a0 ).

All analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.05. \n  \n\n\n\n### Post hoc contrasts \n  \nWe conducted post hoc paired t-tests within each group to assess specific changes from pre to post-conditions. The Cpre vs Cpos contrast was not significant in either FM patients or HC, neither in the pain matrix nor by seed analyses. Thus, the control condition (pink noise) behaved as expected, and had no significant effect on rs-FC of the participants\u2019 pain matrix. However, the Mpre vs Mpos contrast revealed that after listening to music, FM patients showed decreased connectivity of: (1) the pain matrix (12 merged ROIs) with right PCN, right PCC and right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC); (2) the left ACC with right posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) and right superior parietal lobe (SPL); (3) the left AnG with right PCN, left superior frontal gyrus (SFG), right SFG, right PCC, and right posterior MTG; and (4) the left INS with left M1. They also showed increased connectivity of the left AMYG with right MidFG (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). Interestingly, we found that increased rs-FC of the pain matrix in the baseline condition, significantly showed opposite connectivity patterns after listening to music, namely a decrease of rs-FC. Additionally, increased rs-FC between left ACC and right STG (primary auditory cortex) in the baseline condition, significantly decreased after listening to music. Moreover, the increased rs-FC between left AnG and right PCN found in the baseline condition, also significantly decreased after listening to music. Thus, the connectivity changes after music may be interpreted as a \u201cnormalization\u201d from the baseline disrupted rs-FC seen in FM patients when compared to HC.   \nMpre vs Mpos Contrast.

Correlated areas  : CRBL, cerebellum; LG, lingual gyrus; MidFG, middle frontal gyrus; MTG, middle temporal gyrus; M1, precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex); OFC, orbitofrontal cortex; PCN, precuneus; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; SI, postcentral gyrus (primary somatosensory cortex); SFG, superior frontal gyrus; SLOC, superior lateral occipital cortex; SPL superior parietal lobe; STG superior temporal gyrus. All analyzed contrasts were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.05. \n  \n\nThe HC group also showed significant changes in rs-FC after listening to music. We found increased connectivity of: 1) pain matrix (12 merged ROIs) with left superior lateral occipital cortex (SLOC); 2) the right AMYG with right SI, left SLOC, and right SLOC; 3) the right AnG with left lingual gyrus (LG); and 4) the right INS with left CRBL (Fig.\u00a0 , Table\u00a0 ). In other words, HC showed an overall increase of rs-FC after listening to music, that could be secondary to cognitive and emotional processes, as the pain-related regions are not exclusive to pain. Finally, we found no significant interactions with age, anxiety or depression symptoms in either of the groups. \n\n\n### Correlation of resting state functional connectivity and music-induced analgesia \n  \nWe found significant correlations between pain scores and rs-FC of the pain matrix. First, we found a negative correlation between the decrease of pain intensity (\u0394PI) and rs-FC decrease of the pain matrix (12 merged ROIs) with right PCN (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.47, p\u2009=\u20090.03) after listening to music. Then, we also found results while testing correlation by seed, namely significant correlations between the change of pain intensity (\u0394PI) and the change of in rs-FC in FM patients after listening to music (\u0394rs-FC). \u0394PI was negatively correlated with the decrease of rs-FC between: 1) left AnG and right PCC (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.28, p\u2009=\u20090.04), and 2) left AnG and right PCN (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.49, p\u2009=\u20090.04), and it was positively correlated with the increase of rs-FC between left AMYG and right MidFG (r\u2009=\u20090.56, p\u2009=\u20090.02) (Fig.\u00a0 ). In other words, the greater the analgesic effect the greater the decrease of rs-FC between AnG, PCC and PCN, and the greater the increase of rs-FC between AMYG and MidFG. \u0394PU did not show any significant correlation with rs-FC of the pain matrix after listening to music.   \nMusic-Induced Analgesia correlates with rs-FC changes in FM patients.

We found that the rs-FC of several brain regions from the pain matrix were already affected in FM patients, and that the rs-FC of those regions changed (reduced) after listening to music and correlated with analgesia reports. \n\n### Disrupted resting state functional connectivity in fibromyalgia \n  \nOur results showed baseline rs-FC differences of the pain matrix between groups. FM patients showed higher rs-FC between the pain matrix (34 merged ROIs) and left precuneus (PCN), left SFG, right MidFG, right PaCiG, and left PCC; and lower rs-FC with right INS, when compared with HC. FM patients displayed significantly higher rs-FC on cingulate cortex (posterior and anterior) and mPFC, parietal cortex (AnG), and subcortical regions (GP and THA), than healthy controls (HC). The higher rs-FC of frontal and parietal regions with precuneus, may suggest a dynamic coupling of the default mode network (DMN) during pain perception, secondary to a focused attention on their condition . FM patients may continuously engage autobiographical and self-awareness processes, commonly produced during rumination . Our results seem to be consistent with previous neuroimaging studies demonstrating that these regions are activated during pain perception  and are affected in FM . Additionally, the higher rs-FC between the THA and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) may relate to the neuronal facilitation hypothesis of pain input into the central nervous system , though functional connectivity does not convey directionality or the type of neuronal function involved (excitation or inhibition) . Previous studies have found several brain regions such as the PAG, insula (INS), frontal pole (FP), amygdala (AMYG), and rostral ventral medulla (RVM), are involved in the descending pain modulatory system (DPMS) . Finally, the higher rs-FC of basal ganglia (GP) with SMG and SMA may play a role in the integration of motor, emotional, autonomic and cognitive aspects of pain in FM, with an enhanced function of areas related to pain processing . \n\nWe also found lower connectivity in FM patients on several regions, such as the ACC, AMYG, AnG, INS and SMA in FM patients. The lower rs-FC of the right SMA with M1, contralateral SMA and bilateral TP may explain a disrupted connectivity of motor areas with limbic and paralimbic regions. A proposed explanation for this is that the TP binds complex, highly processed perceptual inputs to visceral emotional responses . FM patients seem to process emotion and pain in a different manner than the general population , with relevant deficits in affective modulation measured by cardiac responses, heart rate variability, and neuroimaging , suggesting alteration of emotional and attentional aspects of information processing in chronic pain . Additionally, lower rs-FC between other emotion related regions such as AMYG and INS may support this hypothesis . Finally, the lower rs-FC of ACC and AnG with INS and SI may relate to an altered somatosensory processing with limbic and pain related areas in FM patients , which might be characterized by dissociation between sensory and affective components of pain-related information . Somatic dysfunction in FM, including clinical pain, pain catastrophizing, autonomic dysfunction, and temporal summation, are closely related with the degree to which pain alters SI connectivity with affective pain processing regions , and suggests that affective mood states can modulate central excitability thresholds in chronic pain states . \n\n\n### Music effects on pain and functional connectivity in fibromyalgia \n  \nWe found that listening to music reduced pain in FM patients, and that this effect was related to significant reduction in rs-FC of pain matrix regions. Additionally, we found that the rs-FC of the pain matrix in healthy controls increased after listening to music. This suggests that rs-FC changes after listening to music affected each group differently, as hypothesized. Although our seeds for rs-FC were selected based on prior evidence related to pain perception , these regions are not exclusively related to pain, i.e. INS . Overall, we found that after listening to music, FM patients showed decreased rs-FC of the pain matrix with right PCN, right PCC and right OFC. After testing each seed independently, we found decreased rs-FC in left ACC, left AnG, and left INS seeds with mostly right regions, and increased in left amygdala with right MidFG. \n\n#### The anterior cingulate cortex \n  \nThe ACC has been described as a main hub in cognitive control, from reward processing and performance monitoring, to the execution of control and action selection  and even suggested to be specific to pain processing . There is evidence that the ACC is involved in processing the affective and unpleasant aspects of pain . In our study, the decreased rs-FC of the ACC with the STG (primary auditory cortex) after listening to music may suggest an influence of music and sound processing in the modulation of pain that may not be explained solely by distraction, as the rs-fMRI was acquired after the music listening . Music-evoked memories may play a role in the sustained distraction that prevails with the analgesic effect . Noticeably, the increased rs-FC between ACC and STG in FM patients reported in the baseline condition, was significantly reduced after listening to music, thus, counteracting the altered rs-FC of this important pain-related area. Additionally, our study showed that the decreased rs-FC of ACC with SPL (somatosensory association) after listening to music may suggest disentanglement between areas closely related to pain at the cortical level, that may be related to the analgesic effect . A possible mechanism may suggest a shift in the activity of the ACC from sensory processes to executive control activity by engaging in listening to preferred and pleasurable music. Thus, it seems that music has the ability to reduce the connectivity of the ACC with sensory areas, consequently reducing pain perception. \n\n\n#### The default mode network \n  \nThe DMN is large scale network with areas interacting among themselves in a highly correlated manner . This set of areas appear to be more active when a person is not performing a task, but rather in a mind-wandering state . Neuroimaging studies have evidenced increased activity while thinking about others or oneself, remembering the past and planning the future . \n\nTraditionally, the DMN is anticorrelated with the attention networks, and has been described to have three functional hubs: PCC/PCN, mPFC and AnG . The PCC is an important hub in three networks: (1) the DMN, with increased activity during autobiographical memory ; (2) the dorsal attention network, with increased activity during visual attention and eye movement ; and (3) the frontoparietal control network, involved in executive motor control . Thus, the PCC is specialized in shifting connectivity patterns. The PCN is an area of the DMN involved with episodic memory, visuospatial processing, memory-related imagery, reflections upon self, and aspects of consciousness . It has been proposed to be a small-world network hub connecting parietal and prefrontal areas . The mPFC is a frontal area involved in memory and decision making . As part of the DMN, the mPFC is active while taking decisions about self, such as personal information, autobiographical memories, future goals and events, and decision making regarding our close companions (family) . Additionally, studies have shown that the mPFC and OFC are involved in self-evaluation , and the later has been related with emotion and reward in decision making. The AnG has been related to several brain functions including semantic processing, word reading and comprehension, number processing, memory retrieval, attention and spatial cognition, reasoning, and social cognitions . It has been shown to be an important hub of the DMN, connecting perception, attention and spatial cognition during mental navigation at rest . Although the AnG has not been traditionally related to pain, we decided to include it as a ROI based on two main considerations: 1) our previous study  showed increased amplitude of the BOLD signal in AnG after listening to music, which correlated with analgesia reports, and 2) mental processes related to the DMN, such as autobiographic memory, awareness, and theory of mind, have been shown to be altered in FM . \n\nIn the context of pain, neuroimaging studies have evidenced that various types of clinical chronic pain conditions are associated with rs-FC changes within the DMN . The reorganization seem to linked to the connectivity between the mPFC and INS, and its dissociation from the posterior components of the DMN, which seem to disrupt the competitive inhibition between the DMN and the brain networks underlying attention . Furthermore, FM patients have shown to display altered rs-FC not only of pain-related areas, but also altered function of the DMN . \n\nIn our study, the pain matrix of FM patients showed a significant decrease of rs-FC with right PCN, right PCC and right OFC, after listening to music. After testing each seed independently, it seems that the decrease of rs-FC between AnG and SFG (premotor and SMA) after listening to music may suggest disengagement of areas related to pain and attention . Interestingly, the decrease of rs-FC between AnG, PCC and PCN, may suggest a decrease in the activity of the DMN after listening to music, which may be related to the centralized analgesic effect in FM. Additionally, the decrease of rs-FC with OFC may suggest emotional and cognitive mechanisms such as reward while listening to preferred and pleasurable music. Noticeably, the increased rs-FC between these areas in FM patients reported in the baseline condition, was significantly reduced after listening to music, and significantly correlated with analgesia reports (higher \u0394PI). Thus, a possible counteracting mechanism may occurred, that diminished the disruption in rs-FC of DMN-related areas in FM. Therefore, we may suggest a temporary disruption of autobiographical memory and self-awareness of the pain after listening to preferred music, e.g. disengaging the patient\u2019s state of rumination. \n\n\n#### The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex \n  \nThe dlPFC is a functionally and structurally heterogenous region located in the MidFG , implicated in cognitive , affective , decision-making  and memory processing . It is often associated with maintenance and regulation of top-down modulation, and driving appropriate behavioral responses . The dlPFC is a key node of the extrinsic mode network  and the cognitive control network . In the context of pain, the dlPFC could modulate pain perception through these networks: (1) by controlling the regulation of cognitive networks through effective switching of the default mode network and extrinsic mode network; (2) by increasing the DPMS activity; and (3) by reducing emotional reactivity to pain through reward/fear circuitry . The dlPFC has shown to be active in response to nociceptive stimuli in HC, and has shown different activation patterns between chronic pain patients and HC . The dlPFC has also been implicated in pain suppression mechanisms, as seen in studies of placebo modulation of pain , by integrating incoming nociceptive signals with the expectation of pain . Furthermore, perceived control of pain has been associated with activity of the right dlPFC , evidencing a role in the cognitive component of the pain experience. In our study, we found an increase of rs-FC between right MidFG and left AMYG after listening to music. It seems that after music listening, these two areas increase their connectivity and work synergistically to modulate pain perception via cognitive control. Noticeably, the increase of rs-FC between these areas after listening to music significantly correlated with analgesia reports (higher \u0394PI). \n\n\n#### The limbic areas \n  \nThe structures and interacting areas of the limbic system have been involved in emotion, attention, learning, memory and motivation . Our results show two important areas such as amygdala and insula with altered baseline rs-FC in FM patients compared to HC. Also, FM patients changed the connectivity patterns of these areas after listening to music. The AMYG is an integrative part of the limbic system, involved in many cognitive processes and largely considered as the most primordial and vital part of the limbic system. It has been shown that the AMYG encodes, stores, and retrieves episodic-autobiographical memories . Moreover, the AMYG also seems to be an important region involved in emotional and attentional processes. Historically, this area has been thought to be linked to fear, allowing individuals to take a quick action in response to a threat . However, new research has shown an underlying mechanism in which the AMYG helps an organism to define a stimulus and respond accordingly . In the context of pain, the AMYG has also emerged as an important area for the emotional dimension of pain and pain modulation . The AMYG has a strong network-level interaction with large-scale cognitive/affective cortical networks in chronic pain . It seems that pain generates hyperactivity in the network of lateral, basolateral and central nuclei of the amygdala, which accounts for the emotional dimension of pain. The AMYG has shown strong connections with frontal areas, and altered function may result in declined function (e.g. cognitive and executive). Thus, decreased frontal feedback output to the AMYG allow the uncontrolled persistence of AMYG hyperactivity, and persistence of pain. Thus, effective AMYG-prefrontal connectivity may reflect successful emotion regulation processes . In our study, the increase of rs-FC between left AMYG and right MidFG after music listening may be secondary to the association between auditory attention , memory retrieval , and positive emotions , consistent with the use of a known, pleasant and emotionally positive music track. Moreover, both areas have been related to processes that involve adequate stimulus definition and appropriate behavioral responses . Noticeably, the increase of rs-FC between these areas after listening to music significantly correlated with analgesia reports (higher \u0394PI). \n\nThe insular cortex is an anatomical hub with large connection with cortical and subcortical regions serving sensory, motor, emotional and cognitive functions. In the context of pain, it seems that the INS mediates pain-related negative affect, and studies have shown insular activation when a person experiences pain or observes pain in others . In the context of music, the INS cortex is involved in central auditory processing with efferent projections to the primary auditory, auditory association, and post-auditory cortices . Previous studies have found changes in connectivity of the INS produced by music-listening and musical training . In our study, we found a decrease of rs-FC between INS and primary motor cortex after listening to music, which strongly suggests an analgesic effect, as these regions are usually activated during pain perception . Additionally, an increased activity in the INS secondary to pleasure feelings with music , may shift the insula\u2019s connectivity from a motor region to limbic regions. \n\n\n#### Music-Induced analgesia in fibromyalgia \n  \nIt is important to mention that FM patients show an altered baseline rs-FC  that seems to be the result of the chronic pain and/or disease. Consequently, the dysfunction in the DPMS may induce a reorganization of the \u201cpain-analgesia network\u201d, and in order to modulate pain and produce an analgesic effect the system may be utilizing other circuits. We found that FM patients show increased rs-FC between left ACC and right STG (primary auditory cortex) in the baseline condition, which significantly decreased after listening to music. Similarly, the increased rs-FC between left AnG and right PCN in the baseline condition, also significantly decreased after listening to music (Figs\u00a0  and  ). Noticeably, only AMYG-MidFG, AnG-PCC and AnG-PNC rs-FC was significantly correlated with pain intensity scores (Fig.\u00a0 ). This suggests that the analgesic effect may not directly affect the main regions of the DPMS \u201cgate\u201d such as the PAG, or that we are purely measuring pain reappraisal processed in those regions. Larger studies with better measurements may provide further information about this. From our results, we can suggest cognitive and emotional mechanisms underlying music-induced analgesia. These mechanisms may be produced from brain processes such as distraction, pleasure, familiarity, memory evoked emotions, or a combination of them. It seems that the main feature of MIA in FM relies on shifting connectivity patterns from pain-related areas to executive and cognitive control areas. \n\n\n\n### Music effects on functional connectivity of healthy controls \n  \nListening to music also showed significant changes in rs-FC of the pain matrix in healthy controls . However, as opposed to FM patients, healthy controls mostly showed increased rs-FC on right amygdala and angular gyrus seed regions with occipital areas. A right insula seed reduced its rs-FC with left cerebellum. As mentioned in the beginning of this discussion, the areas selected to build the pain matrix are not exclusive for pain processing, and are active during other cognitive processes. The emotional valence of music may play a role in connecting areas related to limbic, somatomotor, memory and visual imagery processes . The intensity of pleasure experienced from music listening suggests a relation with dopamine reward system of the brain, and neural activity in surrounding limbic regions, indicative of emotional arousal . Right amygdala showed an increased rs-FC with SI and SLOC in both hemispheres after listening to music, which are parietal areas of somatosensory functions and occipital areas involved in visual mental imagery , and therefore, we suggest that music may engage visual imagery in healthy controls as seen in previous studies . We found increased rs-FC of the AnG with the LG, possibly secondary to visual memory and visuo-limbic processes engaged after listening to music . We also found decrease of rs-FC between right insula and left cerebellum, which may be caused by a focused attention on music, and a probable state of relaxation in healthy adults . \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe FM patients in this study were under different types of medication and had several comorbidities that we could not control, and which may affect baseline rs-FC. However, our main results show an analgesic effect of self-chosen, pleasant familiar music, related to changes in rs-FC. To account for any possible comorbidity confounds, we analyzed the data using depression and anxiety covariates, where we found no significant effect of such. It should be noted that the dosage of music intervention in this study may be limited (5\u2009min), and the precise duration of the analgesic effect may be variable; though it seems 5\u2009minutes was enough to elicit MIA. Our FM patients were not blinded to the music condition, which can produce a bias. Given the nature of music, blinding for participants is near impossible and thus a control such as white noise is used instead. In fact, our control condition (pink noise) behaved as expected, as we did not find any significant effect of it on pain perception or rs-FC analyses. Noticeably, the functional connectivity results comparing pre and post music, resulted in only 6 seeds with a change of rs-FC after music in FM patients. We believe that is only reasonable to correlate this neurophysiological data with behavioral data (pain reports pre-post music). We acknowledge how this might appear as double-dipping, but in fact, we are trying to validate subjective data (pain-self report) with objective data (rs-FC). Correlation may be spurious too, hence, we also performed FDR correction on those. We must be careful when interpreting functional connectivity analysis. This type of analysis has the limitation of not measuring directionality, therefore we cannot discuss if one of the areas is driving the change in connectivity pattern. Furthermore, this change in connectivity may be secondary to increase or decrease of activity, which in a more neurobiological point of view, we cannot discuss either if it is an excitatory or inhibitory activity. All we can say is that the pattern of BOLD activity is either correlated or anti-correlated between regions of interest, and infer a change in brain processes. Finally, it should be noted that our HC group did not experience pain, thus, a comparative measure to pain was not possible. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur results show that fibromyalgia patients experienced an analgesic effect after listening to music, and this effect correlated with mostly a reduction in resting state functional connectivity between pain related regions, and areas of the default mode network processing emotion, memory retrieval, and auditory attention. It seems that the main feature of the analgesic effect in fibromyalgia relies on shifting connectivity patterns from pain-related areas to executive and cognitive control areas. Hence, we suggest that music-induced analgesia in fibromyalgia is a top-down mechanism, probably originated by distraction, relaxation, positive emotion, or a combination of these mechanisms. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: Tab1\n### Label: Table 1\nInclusion Criteria for Fibromyalgia Patients.\n\u2022 Meeting the Fibromyalgia1990 and 2010 criteria.\n\u2022 Woman with Fibromyalgia diagnosed by a trained Rheumatologist.\n\u2022 Spontaneous, continuous and intense pain in daily life (VRS\u2009>\u20095 average of a month)\n\u2022 Right-handed.\nInclusion Criteria for Healthy Controls.\n\u2022 Healthy Adult Woman.\n\u2022 Right-handed.\nExclusion Criteria for Fibromyalgia Patients and Healthy Controls.\n\u2022 Impossibility to move or walk.\n\u2022 Uncontrolled endocrine problems.\n\u2022 Neurological alterations (i.e. stroke, epilepsy, recent traumatic brain injury).\n\u2022 Auditory problems.\n\u2022 MRI contraindications (i.e., metal prosthetics).\n\u2022 Pregnancy and/or breast-feeding.\nElimination Criteria for Fibromyalgia Patients and Healthy Controls.\n\u2022 Excessive artifacts in MRI.\n\u2022 Probable pathological findings in MRI.\n### Caption\nParticipant selection criteria.\n### Footer\nVRS, Verbal Rating Scale.\n\n\n## ID: Tab2\n### Label: Table 2\nGroup\tFM (n\u2009=\u200920)\tHC (n\u2009=\u200920)\tp\nGroup\tMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\tMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\tp\nAge\t46.4\u2009\u00b1\u200912.4\t42.1\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5\t0.28\nPCS\t27.6\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5\t12\u2009\u00b1\u200910.9\t<0.001\n\u2022 Helplessness\t13.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7\t4.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\t<0.001\n\u2022 Magnification\t5.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8\t2.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6\t0.012\n\u2022 Rumination\t9.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6\t4.5\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2\t0.001\nPSP\t56.1\u2009\u00b1\u200928.7\t17.6\u2009\u00b1\u200923.7\t<0.001\nSTAI\t52.8\u2009\u00b1\u200920.1\t26.1\u2009\u00b1\u200910.7\t<0.001\n\u2022 State\t19.5\u2009\u00b1\u200910.6\t11.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.1\t0.01\n\u2022 Trait\t33.3\u2009\u00b1\u200912.8\t14.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\t<0.001\nCES-D\t31\u2009\u00b1\u200913.7\t11\u2009\u00b1\u20098.6\t<0.001\n### Caption\nDescriptive and Inferential Statistics of Behavioral Questionnaires.\n### Footer\nFM, fibromyalgia;

However, underlying neurobiology mechanism of heroin relapse under MMT is still largely unknown. Here, we took advantage of a resting-state fMRI technique by analysis of regional homogeneity (ReHo), and tried to explore the difference of brain function between heroin relapsers and non-relapsers in MMT. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nForty MMT patients were included and received a 12-month follow-up. All patients were given baseline resting-state fMRI scans by using a 3.0\u00a0T GE Signa Excite HD whole-body MRI system. Monthly self-report and urine test were used to assess heroin relapse or non-relapse. Subjective craving was measured with visual analog scale. The correlation between ReHo and the degree of heroin relapse was analyzed. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCompared with the non-relapsers, ReHo values were increased in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex, right caudate, and right cerebellum of the heroin relapsers while those in the left parahippocampal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and precuneus were decreased in heroin relapsers. Importantly, altered ReHo in the right caudate were positively correlated with heroin relapse rates or subjective craving response. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nUsing the resting-state fMRI technique by analysis of ReHo, we provided the first resting-state fMRI evidence that right caudate may serve as a potential biomarker for heroin relapse prediction and also as a promising target for reducing relapse risk. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nDrug addiction is a kind of chronic cerebral dysfunction [ ]. Unlike cocaine and cannabis popular in foreign countries, heroin is popular in China [ ]. Compared with cocaine and cannabis, heroin causes more tolerance and addiction. More seriously, once addicted with heroin, it is hard to abstinence [ ]. Currently, methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is a main strategy for the treatment of heroin addiction [ ]. However, unfortunately, MMT cannot completely solve the problem of heroin abuse due to the fact that the relapse rate still remained high under MMT [ ]. Apart from psychological and social factors, many researchers believed that neurobiological factors were also involved in heroin addiction and relapse [ ]. \n\nIn recent years, a body of studies have been making the attempt on neural circuits and brain functions in heroin addiction by using resting-state fMRI method. By comparing heroin addicts with healthy controls, researchers revealed a heroin-related organization pattern. For instance, Ma et al. [ ] observed the enhanced functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and the ventral cingulate cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), or the amygdala whereas the decreased functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate and the prefrontal cortex or the OFC was evident in heroin addicts. With the graph theory analysis, Liu et al. [ ] found dysfunctional connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, insula, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, and ventral striatum in chronic heroin users. Therefore, resting-state fMRI method could not only reveal the abnormal baseline function in heroin users at the resting state, but also show the abnormal functional connectivity of two remote areas. \n\nRecently, the regional homogeneity (ReHo) method [ ] has been developed to analyse the similarities or coherence of intraregional spontaneous low-frequency (<0.08\u00a0Hz) blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations in voxel-wise analysis across the whole brain. Due to independence of the onset time of stimulus, this method is useful for resting-state fMRI data analysis to indicate the resting state in a given brain region. It has been used to investigate the functional modulations in the resting state in healthy aging subjects [ ] and in patients with Alzheimer disease [ ], Parkinson disease [ ], schizophrenia [ ], and neuromyelitis optica [ ]. Importantly, using this method, Qiu et al. [ ] revealed that ReHo values in the bilateral OFC and medial thalamic of heroin addicts were lower than that in healthy subjects. However, at present we still lacked the knowledge about the changes of ReHo between heroin relapse and non-relapse patients receiving MMT. \n\nIn the present study, we included forty heroin addicts, and by using the resting-state fMRI technique to investigate the difference of resting-state brain function between heroin relapser and non-relapser in MMT patients by analysis of ReHo changes, trying to provide a further insight into the neurobiological mechanism underlying heroin relapse in MMT patients. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSixty male former heroin addicts were recruited from the outpatient of the Baqiao Methadone Maintenance Treatment Center in Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi Province, China. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they (a) met the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) for heroin addiction; (b) willingly received long-term and stable MMT; (c) received at least three-month MMT; (d) were right-handed as judged by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ ]. Patients were excluded if they (a) had a history of active neurological and psychiatric disorders besides heroin addiction, (b) had a history of head trauma, medical disorder requiring immediate treatment, and contraindications to MRI examination. \n\nAdditionally, co-morbidity of addiction and psychiatric disorders is very common in heroin addicts, and to avoid the potential influence of psychiatric symptoms, we excluded the patients who reported having a current or past psychiatric illness other than heroin addiction, as described in exclusion criteria. We also evaluated the baseline psychological problems which usually accompanied with heroin addiction, such as depression and anxiety. The Beck Depression Inventory II and Hamilton Anxiety Scale were used to evaluate the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms respectively. There were no significant differences in depression severity and anxiety level between groups (data not shown). \n\nThis study was approved by Institutional Board of the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi\u2019an, China and conducted in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki. All participants were fully informed about the details of experiment and signed the written consents for their involvement and The proposed protocol conforms to the Good Clinical Practice and has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Shaanxi, China. \n\n\n### Experiment design and procedure \n  \nThere were 60 participants recruited in the study. According to the inclusion criteria exclusion criteria, 20 participants were excluded for having other active neurological and psychiatric disorders, head trauma, or contraindications to MRI examination, and 40 were included and then received a baseline resting-state fMRI scanning following with a succeeding 12-month clinical follow-up. During the follow-up, they were supervised under monthly structured interview and urine tests. The participants with once self-reported heroin use or/and positive urine tests were defined as heroin relapser, and those with negative results in tests were defined as non-relapser. Relapse rate of each heroin relapser was calculated as following: total numbers of positive results in tests during MMT/12. The subjective heroin craving was assessed by a 0\u201310 score visual analogue scale (VAS). \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nAll MRI scans were conducted on a Signa EXCITEHD 3.0\u00a0T scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, USA) with an eight-channel head coil. A routine T WI structural scan (parameters: TR\u2009=\u20095100\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u2009117\u00a0ms, matrix\u2009=\u2009416\u2009\u00d7\u2009416, FOV\u2009=\u200924\u2009\u00d7\u200924\u00a0cm , slice thickness\u2009=\u20095.5\u00a0mm, gap\u2009=\u20090.8\u00a0mm) was performed to exclude gross cerebral pathology and then a BOLD functional imaging data was acquired using T2*-weighted gradient-echo planar imaging pulse sequence (GE-EPI, 32 axial slices covering the whole brain, 150 volumes). The parameters were set as follows: TR\u2009=\u20092000\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u00a0ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, matrix\u2009=\u200964\u2009\u00d7\u200964, FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u00a0mm , slice thickness\u2009=\u20094\u00a0mm, gap\u2009=\u20090\u00a0mm; spatial resolution\u2009=\u20094\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u00a0mm . The corresponding high-resolution fast spoiled gradient-echo 3D T -weighted images were also collected for anatomical overlays of the functional data and for spatial normalization of the datasets to a standard atlas and settings were as following: TR\u2009=\u20097.8\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u20093.0\u00a0ms, matrix\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u00a0mm , spatial resolution =1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00a0mm . \n\n\n### Data processing and regional homogeneity calculation \n  \nData preprocessing was performed with software (SPM12;  ) as described previously [ ]. In brief, for each participant the first 10 time points were discarded to avoid transient signal changes before magnetization reached steady state. Translation and rotation were checked and subjects with head movements exceeding than 1\u00a0mm in any direction or head rotations greater than 1\u00b0 were discarded. After the motion correction, spatial normalization was made to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template (resampling voxel size\u2009=\u20093 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3\u00a0mm ). The T1-weighted high-resolution image volume was also spatially normalized to the MNI template. All images spatially normalized to MNI template were transformed to Talairach and Tournoux coordinates and then filtered by using a band-passed filter (0.01\u20130.08\u00a0Hz) to reduce the effect of low-frequency drifts and high-frequency noise. All the data was collected and analyzed by an author (Y.B.L., 5\u00a0years of experience in fMRI analysis) who was blinded to the present study. \n\nFor regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis, the data were processed with a software (REST1.8;  ). The ReHo calculation procedure was performed as previously reported [ ]. In brief, it was performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis by calculating the Kendall Coefficient of Concordance (KCC) of the time series of a given voxel and that of its nearest neighbors. To reduce the influence of individual variation in the KCC, ReHo maps were normalized to the KCC of each voxel by the averaged KCC of the whole brain. The resulting data were then smoothed spatially with a 6-mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel to reduce noise and residual differences in gyral anatomy. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nTo analyse the differences of ReHo values between heroin relapse and non-relapse patients under MMT, a two-sample   t   test was performed on the individual normalized ReHo maps in a voxel-by-voxel manner. A probability of   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 (corrected by FDR) was considered statistically significant. \n\n\n### Correlation analysis \n  \nTo evaluate the association of altered ReHo in different brain regions with heroin relapse in these relapsers, we performed Spearman's correlation analysis between mean ReHo values and relapse rates (as defined above) or subjective heroin craving indicated by VAS scores of each heroin relapser. The correlation analysis was based on non-parametric Spearman correlations and included only the relapsers. Threshold levels of significance for correlation coefficients were adjusted for multiple comparisons by a Bonferroni\u2019s correction (  p   value was set as 0.05, and the number of tests was 8). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nSixty male former heroin addicts were recruited in the present study. Due to head motion, abnormal brain structure and incomplete outcome data, forty were finally included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After 12-month follow-up, 21 participants were classified as relapsers according to the defined criteria for relapse, and 19 as non-relapsers. There were no significant differences between heroin relapsers and non-relapsers in their age, education, number of cigarettes smoked per day, duration of cigarette smoking, duration of heroin abuse and daily/accumulated dosage of heroin/methadone (Table\u00a0 ).   \nClinical characteristics of participants (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D.) \n  \n Note  : Unless otherwise indicated, data are means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviations (S.D.) \n  \n\nCompared with heroin non-relapsers, the relapsers showed significant increases of ReHo in the bilateral medial OFC, right caudate nucleus, and right cerebellum bilateral, but significant decreases of ReHo in the left parahippocampal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, right precuneus, and left middle temporal gyrus (Fig.\u00a0  and Table\u00a0 ).   \nData show brain areas with abnormal ReHo in heroin relapsers compared with non-relapsers under MMT. The differences are shown on whole-brain MR rendering (  a  ) and MR axial view (every 3\u00a0mm,   b  ). Relapsers displayed increased ReHo in the bilateral medial OFC, right caudate, and right cerebellum (  red  ) but decreased ReHo in the left parahippocampal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and precuneus (  blue  ).

Our results showed a positive correlation was observed between mean ReHo values in the right caudate and relapse rates or heroin craving whereas no correlation relationships were found between ReHo values and other brain regions (Tables\u00a0  and  ). Additionally, we also made the correlation between the amount of motion in each subject and the ReHo values, and found a negative result (data not shown), indicating that head motion was not biasing the ReHo.   \nSpearman correlation between mean ReHo of abnormal brain regions and relapse rate in relapse patients \n  \n Note  :   R   right,   L   left,   BA   Brodmann area,   MNI   Montreal Neurological Institute \n\nThe significance for correlation coefficients was corrected by Bonferroni\u2019s test.   p   value was set as 0.05. *,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 \n    \nSpearman correlation between mean ReHo of abnormal brain regions and subjective heroin craving in relapse patients \n  \n Note  :   R   right,   L   left,   BA   Brodmann area,   MNI   Montreal Neurological Institute \n\nThe significance for correlation coefficients was corrected by Bonferroni\u2019s test.   p   value was set as 0.05. *,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study we carried out a 12-month follow-up study using resting-state fMRI by analysis of brain regions with abnormal ReHo in heroin relapsers under MMT, and found that compared with the non-relapsers, an increased ReHo values were evident in the bilateral medial OFC, right caudate nucleus, and right cerebellum of the heroin relapsers while a decreased ReHo in the left parahippocampal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and precuneus. Moreover, ReHo values in right caudate nucleus were correlated with relapse rates or subjective heroin-craving response. \n\nThe medial OFC is a part of the limbic system, and is a functionally heterogeneous region that involved in complex adaptive behaviors. It was reported that in active cocaine abusers, OFC was hypermetabolic in proportion to the intensity of the craving experienced by the subjects [ ] but was hypoactive in drug-addicted subjects tested during withdrawal [ ]. Increased OFC activation has also been associated with drug-related cues [ ], and compulsive drug intake [ ,  ]. Importantly, a preclinical study showed that damage to the OFC resulted in a behavioral compulsion to procure the reward even when it is no longer reinforced [ ]. In the present study, we found increased ReHo in the bilateral medial OFC in the heroin relapsers under MMT, indicating an enhanced local synchronization of spontaneous low-frequency blood oxygenation level-dependent fluctuations in this region, and probably reflecting abnormalities of relapsers in the affective value of reinforcers, decision making and expectation. \n\nCaudate nucleus (dorsal striatum) is a principal brain region of mesostriatum dopamine (DA) pathway and is recognized to contribute to drug addiction [ ]. A group of study have demonstrated that in the caudate nucleus existed significant DA changes when addicts were exposed to drug-related cues, and the magnitude of these changes were correlated with self-reports of craving [ ,  \u2013 ]. For the drug-dependent patients, the enhanced activity in the caudate in response to drug-related cues indicated increased reward-based cognitive processes in the presence of the cues [ ]. These studies disclosed that the caudate nucleus may be a crucial link between conditional and behavioral responses to procure drug and the DA activity responding to drug-related cues, which mediates the habitual nature of subjective experience of caving and compulsive drug-seeking behaviors in addicts [ ,  ]. In this study, we found that heroin relapsers\u2019 ReHo values in right caudate were higher than non-relapsers, suggesting that relapsers had an abnormal reward response relative to the non-relapser even in the resting-sate. \n\nAnother area of the brain with increased ReHo in the present study was the cerebellum, which is reportedly involved in addictive behavior. Previous PET and fMRI studies revealed that drug-conditioned cue could activate the cerebellum and increased its metabolism [ ,  ]. When addicts performed reward expectation tasks, glucose metabolism in their cerebellum was greatly increased [ ]. These results suggested the cerebellum was involved in drug-conditioned memories in addicts. Since cerebellum and caudate are the primary site of rewarding feeling, increased ReHo values in these areas in the relapsers under MMT probably indicated an abnormal enhancement of rewarding effect on heroin or heroin-related cues, leading to compulsive drug-seeking behaviors and ultimately increasing the possibility of heroin relapse. Additionally, cerebellum is also related to learning and memory, increased ReHo in cerebellum may result in abnormal enhancement of positive or negative emotions during drug addiction, which in this study, may induce the occurrence of heroin relapse behaviors. \n\nIn contrast, ReHo in several brain areas, especially in precuneus, were significantly decreased in heroin relapsers relative to non-relapsers. Apart from extension of the visuo-spatial processes subserved by the lateral parietal cortices, precuneus also plays an important role in a diverse array of highly integrated functions, e.g., involving in voluntary attention shifts between targets and playing a central role in the modulation of conscious process [ ]. Precuneus could integrate information, which related to drug cues in the environment with the previously learned association involving those cues and relaying that information to the prefrontal cortex [ ]. We still lacked the knowledge about the decreased ReHo in precuneus of MMT relapsers. This may be associated with the destruction or clinical deficits of precuneus-related visual spatial attention and consciousness in heroin relapsers. \n\nMoreover, we observed a positive correlation between altered ReHo values in the right caudate and relapse rates or heroin craving. These findings support the idea that heroin relapse and craving were related to the caudate nucleus, which plays an important role in the habitual nature of subjective experience of caving and compulsive drug-seeking behaviors in drug addicts [ ,  ]. Importantly, it also suggests that right caudate nucleus may not only serve as a reliable biomarker for predicting heroin relapse but also as a promising target for the treatment of MMT relapse. \n\nAdmittedly, some limitations in the present are worth noting. First, in this study, female subjects were not included. Thus, a possible gender difference in relapse susceptibility was unexplored. Second, the interval of monthly self-report and urine test to assess MMT relapse was relatively long, probably not reflecting the true relapse rates. Finally, it had certain limitations by using urine test to assess the severity of MMT relapse. In addition, in spite of the results obtained above, we still lacked the knowledge about which neural circuit played the crucial role in the relapse behavior in heroin addicts receiving MMT. Therefore, other analysis methods such as fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, degree of centrality maps, and the other metrics provided by resting-state fMRI should be employed to analyze the relationship of resting functional characteristics and relapse need further exploration. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, compared with non-relapsers, heroin relapsers had an abnormal resting-state function. Specially, relapsers displayed increased ReHo in the bilateral medial OFC, right caudate, and right cerebellum but decreased ReHo in the left parahippocampal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and precuneus. The alterations of ReHo in these areas may involve abnormal motivation, reward, memory and visual spatial attention. Overall, our results may add to neurobiological factors associated with relapse to heroin use and also be conducive to developing a promising strategy for heroin addiction therapies. \n\n\n##

One of the most productive areas of interdisciplinary research in this area has been the implementation of biologically-inspired mechanisms in the development of autonomous systems. Specifically, enabling such systems to display adaptive behavior such as learning from good and bad outcomes, has been achieved by quantifying and understanding the neural mechanisms of the brain networks mediating adaptive behaviors in humans and animals. For example, associative learning from aversive or dangerous outcomes is crucial for an autonomous system, to avoid dangerous situations in the future. A body of neuroscience research has suggested that the neurocomputations in the human brain during associative learning involve re-shaping of sensory responses. The nature of these adaptive changes in sensory processing during learning however are not yet well enough understood to be readily implemented into on-board algorithms for robotics application. Toward this overall goal, we record the simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), characterizing one candidate mechanism, i.e., large-scale brain oscillations. The present report examines the use of Functional Source Separation (FSS) as an optimization step in EEG-fMRI fusion that harnesses timing information to constrain the solutions that satisfy physiological assumptions. We applied this approach to the voxel-wise correlation of steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEP) amplitude and blood oxygen level-dependent imaging (BOLD), across both time series. The results showed the benefit of FSS for the extraction of robust ssVEP signals during simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings. Applied to data from a 3-phase aversive conditioning paradigm, the correlation maps across the three phases (habituation, acquisition, extinction) show converging results, notably major overlapping areas in both primary and extended visual cortical regions, including calcarine sulcus, lingual cortex, and cuneus. In addition, during the acquisition phase when aversive learning occurs, we observed additional correlations between ssVEP and BOLD in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as well as the precuneus and superior temporal gyrus. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nAn organism's survival depends on its ability to quickly and adaptively respond to environmental challenges and opportunities. To accomplish this task, the mammalian brain detects and stores the predictive value of recurring environmental signals with respect to dangerous or rewarding outcomes (Sokolov,  ). Established associative networks that link specific stimuli to representations of biological significance and motor action are the mutual interest to Neuroscientists and Neurorobotists (Falotico et al.,  ; Oess et al.,  ). An extensive literature has demonstrated that the neural and hemodynamic amplification of threat, relative to neutral, cues is paralleled by a host of behavioral effects such as facilitated detection (\u00d6hman and Soares,  ), identification (Anderson,  ), and greater perceptual vividness (Todd and Thompson,  ). \n\nHemodynamic and electrophysiological time series represent the two major measurement modalities used in cognitive neuroscience research today. They convey complementary, unique information, with each modality possessing sensitivity to different facets of brain physiology. Above and beyond their well-established differences in temporal and spatial resolution, fMRI-BOLD signals, and electrical field potentials often display divergent responses to experimental manipulations, even in situations where they are considered indices of the same large-scale neural process. Thus, characterizing the relationship between hemodynamic and electrophysiological time series has important implications for neurophysiological studies of the human brain. Consistent with recent empirical studies into the nature of the BOLD signal (Logothetis et al.,  ; Logothetis,  ), and with the biophysics of EEG (Nunez and Srinivasan,  ), the EEG-fMRI fusion approach examined in the present study assumes that co-variation between EEG and fMRI signals accounts only for fraction of the variance of each measure (Herrmann and Debener,  ). To facilitate cross-validation and precise prediction of expected patterns of co-variation, we use non-invasive simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings during a fear conditioning task in which strong and sustained visuocortical responses are elicited. Specifically, we combine fMRI with steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs), elicited by stimuli that are rapidly and periodically modulated in luminance or contrast. Using standard psychophysiological techniques such as EEG, these responsing signals can be recorded at the surface of the scalp as an oscillatory waveform that has the same fundamental frequency as the driving stimulus (Regan,  ). Readily quantified at the level of single trials and of known origin in extended visual cortical areas, this approach allows us to capture different aspects of co-variation in simultaneously EEG and fMRI (Liu et al.,  ): the correlation may reflect responses to experimental events seen in both modalities, mixing trivial effects of joint reactivity of EEG and fMRI to salient external events with correlations of interest such as condition-specific co-variation, or co-variation with various cognitive states. In addition, and of particular relevance in the absence of experimental stimulation, specific portions of the co-variance between modalities may reflect neural-hemodynamic dependencies in spontaneous, ongoing brain activity. In previous work, we have described a method for quantifying the spatial and temporal correlations between the time series of fMRI BOLD and suitable indices derived from the EEG signal (Ji et al.,  ). The present work examines in more detail the benefits of ssVEP preprocessing using Functional Source Separation (FSS) as an optimization step. \n\nThe ssVEP possesses a high signal-to-noise ratio in addition to other desirable qualities for EEG-fMRI fusion: The frequency of the ssVEP is precisely known and can therefore be reliably separated from noise and quantified in the frequency domain (Spekreijse et al.,  ; Regan,  ; Wang et al.,  ). The high signal to noise ratio of ssVEPs allows the robust quantification of visual neuronal population responses at the level of individual trials, of particular interest in the context of EEG-fMRI studies. In terms of neurocognitive function, fluctuations in ssVEP amplitude are sensitive to stimulus content (e.g., Keil et al.,  ) as well as task instructions (e.g., M\u00fcller et al.,  ; Attar et al.,  ). Generators of the ssVEP are in the extended visual cortex (including occipital, temporal, and parietal cortices; M\u00fcller et al.,  ), with most pronounced contributions from retinotopic areas (Wieser and Keil,  ), but also from cortices higher in the visual hierarchy, along the ventral and dorsal streams (Di Russo et al.,  ). The ssVEP technique thus represents a robust and reliable method for non-invasively isolating population-level neuronal responses at low levels of the traditional visual hierarchy (Spekreijse et al.,  ; Regan,  ), very well-suited for joint validation of EEG-fMRI analyses, in which it has been previously used (Sammer et al.,  ). Existing pipeline for ssVEP-fMRI analyses have shown high variability across participants and surprisingly small co-variation of ssVEP amplitude and BOLD magnitude in visual areas. Given that flickering or contrast-reversing stimuli evoke very strong BOLD and electrophysiological responses, it is conceivable that previous findings reflect noise in the single-trial estimation of ssVEPs rather than a lack of co-variation. The present study illustrates the application of a new preprocessing pipeline for ssVEP-fMRI fusion and presents its outcomes regarding group-level findings, including the correspondence of ssVEP-fMRI covariation maps among individual participants (see  ). \n  \nPreprocessing pipeline of ssVEP-fMRI fusion using Functional Source Separation (FSS) as an optimization step, timing information which enhances the identification and separation of relevant signals in electrophysiological time series while maximizing negentropy constraint in the meantime, the summarized ssVEP time series then go for the spatial-temporal correlation analysis with a proper temporal delay. \n  \nEEG quality is a crucial issue when conducting joint EEG-fMRI analyses. Blind source separation (BSS) represents a group of techniques for extracting signals in presence of noise, by exploiting the statistical properties of sources. For example, independent component analysis (ICA) recovers independent sources that contribute to form the measured signal, under the assumptions that they are linearly mixed, and measured with an array of spatially distributed sensors (Comon,  ; Bell and Sejnowski,  ; James and Hesse,  ). ICA is widely used in neurophysiological time series analysis (Makeig et al.,  ; Delorme and Makeig,  ) and is increasingly the standard method when performing single-trial based EEG-fMRI fusion (Debener et al.,  ; Eichele et al.,  ; B\u00e9nar et al.,  ; Mulert et al.,  ) following removal of gross MRI artifacts. It has also been successfully used for removal of eye blinks, eye movements, and electrode artifacts (Debener et al.,  ; Mantini et al.,  ), denoising muscle artifacts (Chen et al.,  ,  ) and MR noises (Acharjee et al.,  ). Several novel techniques have been proposed for multiset and multimodal fusion analysis (Chen et al.,  ,  ). Instead of an entirely blind searching approach that relies purely on statistical properties of the signals, the current study used Functional Source Separation (FSS). This method uses timing information to constrain the solutions, that satisfy physiological assumptions. FSS thus represents an optimization step in EEG-fMRI fusion, with the goal of improving the signal quality of EEG data recorded in the MRI environment. FSS is a semi-blind extension of ICA that incorporates prior knowledge about the responses of interest (Barbati et al.,  ). Thus, FSS enhances the identification and separation of relevant signals in electrophysiological time series while aiming to maximize the neurophysiological validity that is typically associated with using the averaged signal (Ostwald et al.,  ,  ; Porcaro et al.,  ,  ; Naik and Wang,  ). In the present pipeline, following removal of gradient and cardioballsitic artifacts with standard techniques, data were further processed using FSS. \n\nThe present paper illustrates the usage of this FSS based approach for quantifying ssVEP-fMRI co-variation. Using a fusion algorithm that we have previously described (Ji et al.,  ), we applied the FSS preprocessing step to data from a 3-phase aversive conditioning paradigm that included a habituation, acquisition, and extinction phase. EEG and fMRI were recorded simultaneously while participants viewed periodically (10Hz) and rapidly phase-reversing Gabor patches (sine-wave gratings), evoking steady-state visual potentials (ssVEPs). \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nParticipants consisted of 10 undergraduate and graduate students (4 male, average age 20.8 years) who, after giving written informed consent, participated on a volunteer basis or received course credit in the General Psychology course taught at the University of Florida. All participants were screened for metallic implants, claustrophobia, and history of seizure episodes. Female participants self-administered a pregnancy test prior to participation. Data of one additional subject was excluded from the analysis for poor quality of EEG data, defined as retaining <50% of the trials after artifact screening. All procedures were approved by the institutional review board of the University of Florida and were consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki on studies with human participants. \n\n\n### 2.2. Stimuli and Experiment Setup \n  \nStimuli were Gabor patches, i.e., sinusoidal gratings multiplied with a Gaussian envelope. They were oriented at either 15 or 345\u00b0 relative to the vertical meridian. Gabor patches were shown at a maximum Michelson contrast of 95% (maximum = 110  cd  /  m  ; minimum = 2.1  cd  /  m  ) on a dark gray background, at a spatial frequency of 0.45 cycles per degree, and a horizontal visual angle of 15.5\u00b0. Participants viewed all stimuli on a mirror placed on the MR head-coil positioned 8.5 cm from eyes, allowing them to see an MR-compatible monitor that was placed outside the scanner bore. The stimuli reversed their phase every 100 ms to evoke a ssVEP having its second harmonic at 10 Hz. Consistent with previous studies of phase-reversal ssVEP (see Keil et al.,  ; Norcia et al.,   for a review), we analyzed the second harmonic response, i.e., 10 Hz. \n\nThe data presented in this report were recorded from a differential aversive conditioning study in which Gabors of one orientation (but not the Gabor patches with the other orientation) were occasionally paired with an electric shock (see Petro et al.,  , for details). For the habituation block, participants were instructed that they would not feel any shock but to fixate on the patterns. During the acquisition block, participants were informed that they would intermittently feel a cutaneous electric shock during the experiment but were not instructed as to the contingencies of the shock administration. The extinction phase was also uninstructed, such that participants were not told that no more shocks were to be given. Each participant was instructed to remain still while in the scanner and to maintain fixation on the center of the screen. All stimulus presentation was controlled using E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). Cutaneous shocks were administered using an STMISO Stimulation Isolation Adapter (BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA) with MRI-compatible skin electrodes. \n\nThe data reported here include 40 total trials per phase per participant. Each trial consisted of one of the two gratings being presented for 5,100 ms, during which its phase was alternated every 100 ms. An inter-trial interval (ITI) consisted of an initial gray cross (37.5  cd  /  m  ; 1\u00b0 of visual angle) presented in the middle of the screen for a random duration between 0 and 8 s followed by a white cross (149.0   cd  /  m  ) for a duration of 3 s, immediately preceding trial onset with Gabor patch presentation. \n\nEEG data were recorded on a 32-channel MR compatible system (BrainAmp MR plus amplifier by BrainProducts). This system consisted of thirty-one Ag/AgCl electrodes placed on the head according to the 10\u201320 system and one cardioballistic (CB) electrode placed on the upper back to record heart-beats. The reference was positioned at FCz, the ground electrode was placed 1 cm anterior to Oz. Impedances were reduced to below 10 k\u03a9 for all scalp electrodes and below 50 k\u03a9 for the cardio electrode, as suggested by the Brain Products manual. According to the Brain Vision user manual, a sampling rate of 5 kHz EEG permits the TDD (Template Drift Detection) algorithm the highly accurate detection of drifts and shifts in typical MR data set, therefore EEG data were recorded online at 5 kHz and digitized to 16 bit, while the digitized data is transferred via a fiber-optic cable to the recording computer. The system was synchronized to the internal clock of the scanner, and synchronized event marker has been added for further signal processing. \n\nMRI data were collected with a 3T Philips Achieva scanner. An Avotec Silent Scan headphone system was used to diminish gradient noise. Data were acquired during gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence [echo time (TE), 30 ms; repetition Time (TR), 1.98 s; flip angle, 80\u00b0; slice number, 36; field of view, 224 mm; voxel size, 3.5 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 3.5  mm  ; matrix size 64 \u00d7 64]. The first four functional scans were discarded to allow for scanner stabilization. Slices were acquired in ascending order oriented parallel to the plane connecting the anterior and posterior commissure during an 1,850 ms interval with 130 ms between each TR, during which no images were collected and allowed visual inspection of the EEG data during recording when the MR gradient artifact was absent. A T1-weighted high-resolution structural image was obtained after completion of all functional scans. \n\n\n### 2.3. Artifact Handling and Preprocessing \n  \nBrain Vision Analyzer 2.0 (Brain Products) Software was used to remove artifacts caused by the magnetic gradients and heart-beats. Gradient artifacts are due to the switching of magnetic resonance (MR) gradients that is necessary to collect MRI data. The ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact is related to the pulsatile movement of blood and the pulsatile movement of electrodes adjacent to large blood vessels. These two sources of noise are relatively independent. The removal of magnetic gradient artifacts followed a modified version of the algorithm developed in Allen et al. ( ), in which an artifact template constructed from a sliding window of 41 consecutive volumes is subtracted from the EEG data according to the event markers sent from the scanner's internal clock. Cardioballistic artifacts were removed with a standard algorithm as well (Allen et al.,  ). This method detected R peaks in the CB electrode and created a template from 21 consecutive heartbeats, which were subtracted from the continuous EEG data. Particular attention was given to reliable ECG peak detection: Misaligned and falsely detected R peak markers were corrected manually according to the peak of the correlation curve. Data was then down-sampled to 250 Hz. To isolate non-cerebral signals such as eye blinks, ICA was applied, and components with distinct peaks at sensors FP1 and FP2 removed (Delorme and Makeig,  ). Then, the data were referenced to a common average, removing any global, non-cerebral signals that were common to all sensors. \n\nPreprocessing of BOLD fMRI data was completed using SPM12 (Eickhoff et al.,  , freely available at  ). We followed the standard preprocessing routines suggested by SPM: Time differences were compensated by slice timing correction. Head movements were estimated by realigning each scan to match one representative scan with rigid transformation. Images were normalized and registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Functional volume images were re-sampled to a spatial resolution of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3   mm  . Images were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width at half-maximum of 6 mm. Low-frequency temporal drifts were removed from the BOLD data using a 1/128 Hz high-pass filter. \n\n\n### 2.4. FSS With Prior Information \n  \nElectroencephalography (EEG) reflects postsynaptic activity in large populations of cortical neurons that have similar spatial orientation (Nunez and Srinivasan,  ). EEG signals are often assumed to be generated by a linear mixing process of many sources of activity (i.e., many such populations), which may overlap spatially and temporally and are distorted due to the effect of volume conduction. For the ssVEP, the known origin of the signal is located in lower-tier (calcarine fissure) and extended visual cortical areas. Because of the desirable features of the ssVEP (known frequency, high signal-to-noise ratio) robust ssVEP signals can be obtained in the fMRI scanner environment. As illustrated by  , the EEG epochs were extracted in the range of 1 s pre-stimulus and 6 s post-stimulus onset. The resulting data segments of 7 s were transformed into the frequency domain (top left). In the resulting spectrum, the maximum absolute value of the Fourier coefficients was observed at the driving frequency of 10 Hz, most pronounced at posterior electrodes (topographic map, top right). Furthermore, the Grand Mean time domain average across all trials and subjects shows enhanced evoked oscillatory activity (bottom) during the period when the phase-reversing stimulus was on, compared to baseline. FSS aims to maximize the neurophysiological validity that is associated with this latter property of the averaged signal. Therefore, we use timing information to constrain the solutions, while also considering the independence source constraint, which enhances the identification and separation of relevant signals in electrophysiological time series. The modified contrast function is: \n\nThe FSS optimization tends to find a projection vector   w   that maximizes the above contrast function.   J   can be any function for ICA. Here, we adopted the criteria of fastICA (Hyvarinen,  ), aiming to minimize the Gaussianity of the results (equivalently, to find the separation vector in which the negentropy is maximized), since the observed mixed signals will tend to have more Gaussian amplitude distributions. The function   H   accounts for prior information we have on sources, which give preference to solutions that tend to satisfy physiological assumptions. Parameter \u03bb is used to weigh the two parts of the contrast function, chosen to be 10 for ssVEP recovery. \n  \nGrand Mean time series of filtered (0.5\u201330 Hz) EEG time-series (Oz) time locked to trial onset and averaged across all trials and subjects (bottom). Oscillatory activity driven by stimuli picture evoked flicker stream (10 Hz) are the dominant signals as illustrated by the frequency domain spectrum (top left), most strongly represented by posterior electrodes in the topographic map (top right). \n  \nThe function   J   serves as a generalization of the cumulant-based approximation of negentropy \n\nwhere   x   is the pre-processed EEG and   v   is a standardized Gaussian variable. The variance of   w   x   must here be constrained to unity. The following choices of   G   have proven useful according to Hyvarinen ( ), Hyv\u00e4rinen and Oja ( ) \n\nwhere 1 \u2264   a   \u2264 2 is some suitable constant, we here chose   a   = 1. \n\nTo facilitate the FSS optimization, a zero-phase narrow bandpass filter centered at the target frequency 10 Hz with plus and minus 0.5 Hz was applied. The stimulus response is defined as \n\nwith the evoked activity, EA, computed by averaging signal epochs of the estimated source   w   x  , which lasted for 5 s for the post-stimulus reactivity and 1 s for the pre-stimulus baseline. Accordingly, the upper and lower limits of the integral are set as   t   = 0,   t   = 5 and   t   = \u22121. The operation   abs  (  Hilbert  (\u00b7)) extracts the envelope of the evoked activity (Bracewell and Bracewell,  ; Huang,  ). Following the former work (Barbati et al.,  ) which apply FSS on MEG data, a saturation function is adopted in function   H   and tuned to suit the ssVEP study: \n\nwhere \n\nwhere   k   is the parameter measuring the required minimum response, so as to define an admissible region where the optimization is only driven by   J   when response is greater than   k  . For the present application, the maximum   R   for each phase is computed separately with fastICA, and assigned to   k  . Since prior information about the sources can only be described by a non-differentiable function, simulated annealing is employed for global optimization (Kirkpatrick et al.,  ; Ingber,  ). To ensure the stability and reliability of the optimization procedure, the contrast function for all three phases were added up and jointly optimized. \n\nThe approach described above gives us the possibility to extract only one component that maximizes the functional behavior in agreement with the functional constraint. \n\n\n### 2.5. Quantifying the SNR of Extracted ssVEP \n  \nIn order to evaluate the performance of FSS optimization, the signal-to-noise ratio is determined by comparing the signal level during the stimuli on period with the signal level without stimulus. The pre-stimulus baseline from \u22121 to 0 s was set as the time interval of background/baseline noise, during which the participant was instructed to maintain fixation on a white cross, preceding the onset of the Gabor patch. In addition, a period from the inter-trial baseline (5.6\u20137 s after stimulus onset) was also included as a manipulation check, quantifying the extent to which the extracted ssVEP oscillation attenuates after stimulus offset. Since this part of background information is blind to FSS optimization, it represents an intuitive test for neurophysiological validity. \n\n\n### 2.6. ssVEP-BOLD Fusion \n  \nTo assess the spatial-temporal correlation between EEG and fMRI responses recorded simultaneously, the recovered ssVEP source was averaged across time segments of each fMRI scan, representing the intensity of neuronal activities, resulting in a time series with the same temporal resolution of the BOLD. As in the procedure of FSS optimization described in methods, the proper scaling (including sign) of the source signals is non-recoverable, we are mostly interested in the predictability reflects the proportion of the variance in the BOLD signal that is linearly predicted from ssVEP time series. Following the previous work (Wang and Zheng,  ; Ji et al.,  ), we use the bivariate case of cross multivariate correlation coefficient (xMCC) for correlation analysis between EEG and fMRI, which is equal to the absolute value of the cross correlation coefficient. The metabolic (BOLD) events are slower and temporally lagged to the neuro-electric activity (EEG). Based on the large body of research on stimulus-BOLD latency performed in the visual cortex (Buxton et al.,  ; Serences,  ; Penny et al.,  ), we adopt the consensus setting of 4 s as the latency of BOLD relative to neural events. \n\n\n### 2.7. Statistical Inference: Permutation Testing \n  \nTo assess the statistical significance of the correlation results, we applied permutation tests to determining the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis of no linear relation based on shuffled data, and assumed statistical significance (permutation controlled in brain regions) if   p  -value is less than 0.05 for single participant. Given the small size of the present sample, the robustness of a given ssVEP-fMRI correlation across participants was quantified by measuring inter-subject overlap of voxels showing significant correlations after thresholding by a permutation test, using a binomial test. To this end, we calculated the probability of overlap at a given voxel under the null hypothesis that significant correlations occurred in different voxels and different participants. The resulting   p  -values were then corrected by the number of voxels considered overall, resulting in a threshold of 0.5 at a given voxel (i.e., five out of 10 participants showing permutation controlled, significant correlations at that voxel). These results were compared to the average correlation map, to establish the validity of this conservative statistical approach. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. EEG-ssVEP Source Extraction \n  \nThe SNR index was evaluated for each participant and experimental phase separately, and compare with ICA results optimized for each phase separately. As a referencing index, in   we reported the spectrum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR_RAW), which divides the power of ssVEP at 10 Hz by the mean power of neighboring bins in the spectral range between 0.5 and 30 Hz, together with ssVEP amplitude (ssVEP_AMP) (Keil et al.,  ), by averaging the EEG traces in the moving windows in the time domain, which was then submitted to a Discrete Fourier Transform to get the 10 Hz ssVEP amplitude. \n  \nSNR index for ICA and FSS optimization were calculated, for each participant and experimental phase. \n  \n Raw spectrum SNR (sensor Oz, 0.5\u201330 Hz) and amplitude of ssVEP are given as a reference. SNR_FSS is underlined when SNR_FSS is lower than SNR_ICA  . \n  \nTo illustrate the effects of preprocessing method, time course data of the averaged ssVEP epochs recovered by FSS across trials (blue traces) are overlapped with the results of ICA (dashed green traces) in  . The outline (equivalent to the envelope) of the blue oscillations (FSS-ssVEP) overall shows more stability and less noise across time, including in the baseline segment, compared to the green (ICA) envelope, which tends to be larger in the baseline segment and shows more temporal variation during the steady-state segment. Note that data from all phases were used in the joint optimization process. This will in some cases yield a less favorable signal-to-noise ratio compared to identifying optimal components for each single phase. However, a joint optimization across phases is expected to achieve more robust and more externally valid results, being based on more trials. On the other hand, noise such as alpha oscillations (generally in the range 8\u201313 Hz), or the absence of an ssVEP signal, may interfere with the optimization procedure, producing divergent results as shown for participant number 07. \n  \nMaps of the averaged ssVEP epochs recovered by FSS (blue oscillations) along with the envelope of ssVEP optimized by ICA (dashed green line), for each participant (row) and experimental phase (column): habituation (HAB), acquisition (ACQ), and extinction (EXT).

For each participant, voxels that survived individual permutation-controlled thresholding were kept and submitted to a group-level binomial test.

Additional areas of ssVEP-BOLD co-variation were seen in the postcentral cortex, the rolandic operculum, and superior temporal gyrus.

Discussion \n  \nThe present study aimed to illustrate the usefulness of FSS as a preprocessing step for joint analyses of fMRI-BOLD and ssVEPs, strong oscillatory signals originating in visual cortex and modulated by re-entrant inputs from a number of anterior structures (Keil et al.,  ; Norcia et al.,  ). We used data from an experiment in which participants were aversively conditioned to associate the orientation of a phase-reversing grating with a mild electric shock (Petro et al.,  ). The experiment contained three distinct phases, which were used here to examine the convergence of ssVEP-BOLD covariation maps across three re-tests, leveraging the within-participant design of this study. We found substantial overlap of ssVEP-fMRI co-variation maps in extended visual cortex, superior temporal cortex, and parietal cortex. This is consistent with the sources of ssVEP established through intracranial recordings in humans and experimental animals (see e.g., Wittevrongel et al.,  ). Furthermore, the cross-participant and re-test convergence along with the large spatial extent of the ssVEP-fMRI covariation in visual cortex observed in the present study exceeds earlier analyses of this same data-set with different methods, i.e., parametric modulation analysis as implemented in SPM (Petro et al.,  ), and multivariate correlation analyses without the FSS preprocessing step (Ji et al.,  ). Because the covariation of both signal modalities across the time series in visual cortex can be considered a gold standard for analytical strategies, the fact that ssVEP-fMRI correlations were observed reliably in extended visual cortex suggests that FSS represents a desirable preprocessing step, positively affecting the validity of EEG-fMRI fusion. \n\nAlthough no explicit comparisons between experimental phases were made, the ssVEP-fMRI co-variation map during the acquisition phase, in which the visual cues were occasionally paired with electric shocks, showed co-variation of ssVEP amplitude and BOLD signal in additional parietal and anterior structures. These structures included the anterior cingulate gyrus, known to be involved in fear acquisition and associative learning in general (e.g., Sehlmeyer et al.,  ; Fullana et al.,  ). As such, this finding further supports the validity of FSS-based preprocessing for ssVEP-fMRI fusion. \n\nIt should be noted that this study was limited in terms of sample size and in terms of signal-to-noise, low in some participants, despite the precise definition of ssVEPs in the frequency domain (Norcia et al.,  ). Although information theoretic approaches (Ostwald et al.,  ,  ) have been proposed, which apply information criteria such as mutual information to quantify the association of multimodal signals, it is difficult to estimate the probability distribution reliably with small sample size, and the results are sensitive to free parameters. Furthermore, it is not within the scope of this manuscript to quantitatively compare many alternative pipelines to establish the benefits of FSS relative to other methods. Such analyses have been performed with other data types (Porcaro et al.,  ). However, both ongoing and future research will establish and further optimize preprocessing steps for ssVEP-fMRI fusion. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, the present study demonstrated that FSS, in conjunction with a multivariate correlation and feature selection approach proposed previously (Ji et al.,  ), yields robust ssVEP-fMRI co-variation maps with high face validity (i.e., high correspondence between BOLD and ssVEP in visual cortex, where strong responses are expected to during visual stimulation) and with high replicability across re-tests (i.e., across three experimental phases) in the same participants. The work is important to neurorobotics for several reasons: (1) This approach could be used to examine a wide range of hypotheses regarding the neurophysiology of visual cortex and its function for biological and artificial systems, (2) it provides a means to conduct the multi-modal information fusion and correlation analysis to recover the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, and (3) the core idea of the approach are inspiring for other brain data processing and the knowledge can be transferred to other applications as well. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nAll procedures were approved by the institutional review board of the University of Florida and were consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki on studies with human participants. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nAll authors had full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

For example, some authors have reported deficits on newly developed tests of executive function sensitive to rostral prefrontal function, despite spared, or even superior, performance on other tests. We investigated the performance of a group of high-functioning participants with ASD (  N  \u00a0=\u00a015) and an age- and IQ-matched control group (  N  \u00a0=\u00a018) on two executive function tests, whilst undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Behaviourally, there were no significant differences between the two groups. In a classical test of executive function (random response generation), BOLD signal differed between the groups in the cerebellum but not in the frontal lobes. However, on a new test of executive function (selection between stimulus-oriented and stimulus-independent thought), the ASD group exhibited significantly greater signal-change in medial rostral prefrontal cortex (especially Brodmann Area 10) in the comparison of stimulus-oriented versus stimulus-independent attention. In addition, the new test (but not the classical test) provided evidence for abnormal functional organisation of medial prefrontal cortex in ASD. These results underline the heterogeneity of different tests of executive function, and suggest that executive functioning in ASD is associated with task-specific functional change. \n \n\n# Body\n \nAlong with well-documented abnormalities in social interaction, communication, perception and attention ( ), a large number of recent studies have provided evidence for disruption of executive functions in autism spectrum disorders (ASD; see e.g.  ;  ;  ;  ). Functional neuroimaging studies have also pointed towards atypical brain activity in participants with ASD when performing executive function tasks (e.g.  ;  ). However, evidence from different studies has not always been consistent. In part, this mixed evidence may be accounted for by methodological issues such as the heterogeneity of the patient groups studied and the most appropriate ways of matching patient with control groups ( ). However, another explanation may be the heterogeneity of the processes referred to as \u2018executive functions\u2019 ( ). Executive function is an umbrella term encompassing a wide range of high-level processes for controlling and organising behaviour, such as planning, inhibition, multitasking, monitoring and so on ( ;  ;  ;  ). There is therefore no reason to suppose that performance on one test of executive function should necessarily mirror performance on another. Indeed, correlational studies have suggested that although there are often significant correlations between scores on various tests of executive function, these correlations tend to be rather low (typically   r  \u00a0<\u00a00.4;  ;  ). Moreover, factor analysis reveals the presence of multiple distinct factors in scores derived from batteries of executive function tests (e.g.  ;  ). \n\nAlthough the frontal lobes, and particularly the prefrontal cortex, have long been recognised as playing an important role in higher-level control (e.g.  ;  ;  ), only recently have neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies begun to delineate distinct regions of prefrontal cortex supporting different aspects of executive function. In part, the evidence for such distinctions originated from studies of patients with frontal lobe lesions, who experienced behavioural disorganisation in everyday life with such severity that they were unable to return to work at their previous level, yet performed well on classical tests of executive function such as the Stroop task ( ), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST;  ), Tower of London ( ), verbal fluency ( ) and so on.   designed two new tasks \u2013 the \u201cMultiple Errands Test\u201d and \u201cSix Element Test\u201d \u2013 that were sensitive to deficits in three patients with frontal lobe lesions, who performed other tests of executive function within normal limits. Subsequent studies have suggested that these tasks, which depend upon behavioural organisation within relatively ill-constrained or ill-structured situations (i.e. multitasking), are particularly sensitive to lesions within the rostral prefrontal cortex, approximating Brodmann Area (BA) 10 ( ;  ; see also  ). \n\nIntriguingly, recent evidence suggests that executive deficits in high-functioning adults with ASD may be particularly apparent in new tests of executive function involving multitasking, rather than more constrained classical tests of executive function.   tested 22 high-functioning participants with ASD and 22 well-matched controls (matched on an individual basis) on a battery of executive function tests. Although there were no significant differences between the groups on standard tests of executive function (e.g. Stroop, WCST, verbal fluency), newer tests did distinguish the two groups, with abnormal behaviour in the ASD group being particularly apparent on the Six Element Test (SET). \n\nGiven the variability in results from previous studies ( ) it may be premature to point to a particular executive function test, or set of tests, that best distinguish participants with ASD from control participants. However, a consistent finding has been that participants with ASD tend to show deficits on only a restricted set of executive function tests, with preserved or superior performance in other domains ( ;  ). This contrasts with other populations, who may be more likely to show more widespread deficits, such as those with schizophrenia ( ). The uneven profile of performance seen in studies that have investigated executive functions in ASD argues against a \u201cdeficit model\u201d of the processing differences between participants with ASD and controls, and instead suggests that ASD may be better characterised by disruption or reorganisation of specific brain systems, rather than more generalised impairment ( ). \n\nOne candidate brain region that may show such disruption or reorganisation in ASD is medial rostral PFC, corresponding approximately to the medial part of Brodmann Area 10 and the adjacent \u201cparacingulate\u201d region ( ). This region has been implicated in both structural ( ) and functional ( ) change in ASD (see   for further evidence from a study that combined structural and functional imaging approaches). Furthermore, it has been argued that this area is involved in multitasking ( ;  ) and mentalizing, or theory of mind ( ), both of which have been suggested to be compromised in ASD ( ;  ). \n\nRecently,   and   have argued that particular regions of rostral PFC play an important role in selection between stimulus-oriented and stimulus-independent thought, i.e. attentional selection between current perceptual input versus self-generated information. Several recent neuroimaging studies have suggested that this form of attentional selection is supported by rostral PFC ( ;  ;  ). For example, in a study by  , participants performed three separate tasks that could either be accomplished by attending to task-relevant visual information (during \u201cstimulus-oriented phases\u201d), or by performing the same task \u201cin their heads\u201d (during \u201cstimulus-independent phases\u201d). Consistently across the three tasks, medial rostral PFC (approximating BA 10) showed greater activity throughout stimulus-oriented phases, compared with stimulus-independent phases. This finding is of particular relevance for understanding the brain mechanisms supporting multitasking. Tests of multitasking depend heavily on the ability to organise behaviour according to previously formed plans that are not immediately cued by the environment (i.e. prospective memory). For instance, in the SET, participants must perform the individual subtasks whilst at the same time maintaining an intention to switch between tasks in the future. In such situations, participants must bear in mind an internally represented intention to act whilst also monitoring events in the external environment as part of the ongoing tasks. It therefore seems likely that multitasking will depend critically on the ability to flexibly deploy attention between the external environment and internal representations ( ). On this evidence, it seems possible that executive tasks stressing this form of attentional selection may be particularly sensitive to atypical information processing in ASD. \n\nIn the present study, we therefore investigated performance of participants with ASD performing two tests of executive function: one that is a more standard test, and one that requires switching between stimulus-oriented and stimulus-independent thought. For the standard test of executive function we chose a random response generation task. Random generation tasks have a long history of investigation within cognitive psychology (e.g.  ). Such tasks place demands on executive functions in at least two respects. First, random generation may require participants to switch flexibly between different sequence-generation strategies (because using the same strategy for too long would lead to stereotyped responding). Second, it may be necessary to inhibit prepotent response tendencies, such as sequential cycling through the response options ( ). Neuroimaging studies have indicated widespread prefrontal and premotor activity associated with random generation tasks (e.g.  ). In addition, it has been shown that disruption of dorsolateral PFC activity with transcranial magnetic stimulation leads to an increase in stereotypical responding in such tasks ( ). However, random generation tasks are not believed to depend critically on the functions of medial rostral PFC. The second executive function test used in the present study was a version of one of the tasks investigated by  , involving selection between stimulus-oriented and stimulus-independent thought. This task may index cognitive processes that also play a role in more complex situations, such as those involving prospective memory or behavioural organisation in ill-structured circumstances ( ). We expected activity in medial rostral PFC to be particularly associated with the stimulus-oriented phases of this task. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThirty-three individuals participated in the study: 15 participants with Autism Spectrum Disorder (12 males; 3 females) and 18 non-autistic control participants (13 males; 5 females). Groups were matched on age (ASD   M  : 38 years, SD: 13; control   M  : 32 years, SD: 8;   t  (31)\u00a0=\u00a01.6,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.13), and IQ (ASD   M  : 119, SD: 14; control   M  : 119, SD: 11;   t  (31)\u00a0=\u00a00.1,   p  \u00a0=\u00a0.93). Full-scale IQ was measured using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 3rd UK Edition ( ), apart from one control participant for whom IQ was estimated from the National Adult Reading Test (NART;  ). All participants in the ASD group had previously received a diagnosis from an independent clinician according to standard criteria. The Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G,  ), was used to characterise the participants\u2019 level of current functioning. This measure was chosen because all participants were adults; it was therefore not always possible to interview parents or caregivers, as required by other measures such as the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI;  ). On the ADOS-G, eight participants met criteria for autism, whilst six participants met criteria for autistic spectrum disorder. One participant was unwilling to complete the ADOS-G. All participants were right-handed, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were na\u00efve with respect to the purpose of the experiment. None had performed the present experimental tasks, or related tasks, previously. The experiment was performed with local ethical committee approval and in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before their inclusion in the study. \n\n\n### Tasks \n  \n Random generation task:   In this task, participants were presented with a timing signal in the form of a small square (approximately 0.2\u00b0 tall and wide), which appeared for 100\u00a0ms either every 750\u00a0ms (fast condition) or every 2000\u00a0ms (slow condition; see below). Participants were instructed to press one of four response buttons (with index or middle fingers of left or right hand) in synchrony with the appearance of this timing signal. In the experimental condition, participants were instructed to press buttons in a random sequence, as if the button-press on each trial were determined by rolling a die. In the baseline condition, participants repeatedly pressed the four buttons in a stereotyped sequence: left middle, left index, right index, right middle. The timing signal was presented in a different colour (green or blue) depending on condition, counterbalanced between participants. \n\n Alphabet task:   In this task (modified from  , Task 3) the experimental condition alternated between stimulus-oriented (SO) and stimulus-independent (SI) phases. During SO phases, participants classified capital letters by pressing one of two buttons, according to whether the letter was composed entirely of straight lines (e.g. \u201cA\u201d), or whether it had any curves (e.g. \u201cB\u201d). Immediately following each button press, the subsequent letter in the alphabet was presented. Stimuli were presented in Arial typeface, approximately 1\u00b0 tall and wide. During SI phases, randomly chosen letters were presented and participants were required to mentally continue the sequence from their current position in the alphabet, performing the same classification task for each self-generated letter. In this condition, the correct continuation of the alphabet sequence was never presented on screen. Stimuli in the two phases were presented in different colours (red or blue), with the assignment of each colour to a particular phase counterbalanced across participants. The first letter to be presented in each SO phase was the appropriate continuation of the sequence, assuming that the sequence had been correctly maintained during the preceding SI phases. Transitions between the SO and SI phases occurred with a mean interval of 7.5\u00a0s (range 3\u201321\u00a0s). During blocks of the Alphabet task, participants also performed a baseline condition in which non-alphanumeric non-meaningful stimuli were presented, requiring classification as straight or curved. However, since the main purpose of the Alphabet task was to investigate selection between stimulus-oriented and stimulus-independent processing, this baseline condition (involving stimulus-oriented processing alone) is not examined further in the present article (for discussion see Gilbert, Bird, Frith, & Burgess, in preparation). \n\n\n### Scanning procedure \n  \nParticipants were familiarised with the tasks during a practice session lasting approximately 15\u00a0min, immediately before the scanning session. A 3T Siemens Allegra head-only system was used to acquire both T1-weighted structural images and T2*-weighted echoplanar (EPI) images [64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064; 3\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm pixels; echo time (TE), 30\u00a0ms] with BOLD contrast. Each volume comprised 48 axial slices (2\u00a0mm thick, separated by 1\u00a0mm), oriented approximately parallel to the AC\u2013PC plane, covering the whole brain. Functional scans were acquired during four sessions, each comprising 121 volumes (lasting \u223c6\u00a0min). Volumes were acquired continuously with an effective repetition time (TR) of 3.12\u00a0s per volume. The first five volumes in each session were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects. Each task was performed for two of the four sessions, in an AABB order counterbalanced across participants. Within each session, participants alternated between experimental (40\u00a0s) and baseline (20\u00a0s) conditions, performing each condition five times per session. In the Random task, the timing signal was presented every 750\u00a0ms in one session, and every 2000\u00a0ms in the other, with the order counterbalanced between participants. Following the functional scans, a 12-min T1-weighted structural scan was performed. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nfMRI data were analysed using SPM2 software ( ). Volumes were realigned, corrected for different slice acquisition times, normalized into 2\u00a0mm cubic voxels using a standard EPI template based on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference brain using 4th-degree B-spline interpolation, and smoothed with an isotropic 8\u00a0mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel. The volumes acquired during the four sessions were treated as separate time series. For each series, the variance in the BOLD signal was decomposed with a set of regressors in a general linear model ( ). In the Alphabet task, variance was decomposed into components associated with responses made during the stimulus-oriented and stimulus-independent phases, as well as responses made during performance of the baseline straight/curved task. These regressors were derived from delta functions convolved with a canonical haemodynamic response function. An additional regressor indexed sustained activity during the instruction periods, using a boxcar function convolved with a canonical haemodynamic response function. In the Random task, variance was decomposed into components associated with sustained activity during the random generation phases and the baseline phases, using boxcar functions convolved with a canonical haemodynamic response function. These regressors, together with regressors representing residual movement-related artefacts and the mean over scans, comprised the full model for each session. The data and model were high-pass filtered to a cut-off of 1/128\u00a0Hz. \n\nParameter estimates for each regressor were calculated from the least mean squares fit of the model to the data. Effects of interest were assessed in random effects analyses using   t  -tests on contrast images generated from subject-specific analyses. Contrasts were thresholded at   P  \u00a0<\u00a00.001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons, with a minimum extent of five contiguous voxels. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioural data: random generation task \n  \nThe randomness of sequences produced in the experimental condition was evaluated by investigating dependencies between successive responses. In a truly random sequence, the probability of each of the four responses should be the same, regardless of the preceding response. However, previous studies have identified a number of biases in random generation behaviour, one of the most pervasive being the tendency of participants to avoid repeating their previous response ( ).   shows the probability of each of the four possible responses \u2013 (a) same as last trial; (b) same hand, different finger; (c) other hand, same finger; d) other hand, different finger \u2013 separately for the ASD and control group, split into \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d blocks. Due to technical problems, behavioural data were not available in this task for two control participants. Both groups tended to repeat responses less often than would be expected by chance, and to swap hands more often. However, an ANOVA with within-subject factors of Response-Type and Speed, and a between-subject factor of Group (ASD, Control) showed that although there were significant deviations from truly random behaviour (  F  (3, 27)\u00a0=\u00a011.7;   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.0001), the groups did not differ in this respect (  F  \u00a0<\u00a01) and there were no interactions involving the Speed factor (  F  (3, 27)\u00a0<\u00a02.1,   p  \u00a0>\u00a0.12). \n\n\n### Behavioural results: alphabet task \n  \nMean RTs and error rates are displayed in  . Mean RTs were examined in an ANOVA with within-subject factors Phase (Stimulus-Oriented [SO] or Stimulus-Independent [SI]) and Switch (Switch trial \u2013 i.e. immediately following a switch between the SO and SI phases \u2013 or Non-switch trial) and between-subjects factor Group (ASD or Control). There were main effects of Phase, SI trials being slower than SO trials, and Switch, Switch trials being slower than Non-switch trials, along with a Phase \u00d7\u00a0Switch interaction, because the RT difference between Switch and Non-switch trials was larger in the SI phase than the SO phase (  F  (1, 31)\u00a0>\u00a021;   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.0001). However, although there was a trend towards slower RTs in the ASD group, neither the main effect of Group nor any of its interactions approached significance (  F  (1, 31)\u00a0<\u00a01.7,   p  \u00a0>\u00a0.2). A similar analysis of error rates revealed a main effect of Phase and a Phase\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Switch interaction of the same type as the RT data (  F  (1, 31)\u00a0>\u00a09.7;   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.005). However, again there was no significant main effect or any significant interactions involving the Group factor (  F  (1, 31)\u00a0<\u00a04.1),   p  \u00a0>\u00a0.05). \n\n\n### fMRI results: random generation task \n  \n lists regions exhibiting significant differences in BOLD signal between the Random and Baseline conditions, separately for the ASD and Control groups (see also  ). Results were collapsed over the fast and slow blocks in this task, because there were no significant group differences associated with this factor. Both groups showed significantly increased signal during the Random condition in lateral PFC, premotor cortex/SMA, superior parietal cortex and cerebellum. In the reverse contrast (Baseline\u00a0>\u00a0Random), both groups showed differences in BOLD signal in medial rostral PFC, posterior cingulate and lateral temporal regions ( ). However, the only regions to show a significant difference between the ASD and control groups were left cerebellum and a small cluster of voxels in left lateral temporal cortex (BA 37), both of which showed a larger effect in the Baseline\u00a0>\u00a0Random contrast in the Control than the ASD group ( ; cerebellum: \u221224, \u221246, \u221230;   z  \u00a0=\u00a03.79; 108 voxels; temporal cortex: \u221242, \u221258, \u221218;   z  \u00a0=\u00a03.22; 6 voxels). Thus, both groups showed similar patterns of results in the frontal lobes: increased activity in the Random condition in lateral prefrontal regions and posterior frontal regions (SMA/anterior cingulate) and increased activity in the Baseline condition in medial rostral PFC (BA 10). \n\n\n### fMRI results: alphabet task \n  \n lists regions exhibiting significant differences in BOLD signal between the Stimulus-Independent (SI) and Stimulus-Oriented (SO) conditions, separately for the ASD and Control groups (see also  ). Both groups showed significantly increased signal during the SI condition in lateral prefrontal and premotor regions, along with superior parietal cortex. However, of more theoretical interest was the analysis of regions showing increased signal in the SO condition, because this was the contrast expected to produce activity in medial rostral PFC, on the basis of previous studies (e.g.  ;  ). This contrast produced activity in medial rostral PFC in both groups, along with lateral parietal cortex ( ). However, the medial PFC activation in the ASD group appeared more extensive than in the control group. This appearance was confirmed in a direct comparison between the groups, revealing significantly greater activity in the ASD group associated with the SO\u00a0>\u00a0SI contrast in medial PFC, along with temporal pole, amygdala, cerebellum, and other temporal and parietal regions ( ). Thus, whereas the random generation task did not reveal any frontal lobe differences between the groups, there was a significant difference between the groups in medial rostral PFC associated with the SO\u00a0>\u00a0SI contrast in the alphabet task. In addition, the control group exhibited significantly greater medial occipital and medial parietal activation associated with the SO\u00a0>\u00a0SI contrast than the ASD group ( ). \n\nIn order to test whether the apparently task-specific group differences reported above could reflect a thresholding artefact, rather than any genuine difference between the random generation and alphabet tasks, an analysis was conducted of Task\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Group interactions. Whereas the chief between-group difference in the random generation task was observed in the cerebellum, the alphabet task revealed between-group differences primarily in medial rostral PFC. Both of these regions showed significant activity in the analysis of Task\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Group interactions (e.g. cerebellum: \u221228, \u221244, \u221230;   z  \u00a0=\u00a03.31; 20 voxels;   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.0005; medial rostral PFC: 20, 60, 2;   z  \u00a0=\u00a03.36; 7 voxels;   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.0004; 12, 52, 34;   z  \u00a0=\u00a03.31; 153 voxels;   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.0005). Thus, the present results do not simply reflect the two tasks activating similar brain regions, with different regions just above or just below threshold. \n\nIn an additional analysis, the theoretically important group difference in medial rostral PFC was investigated at a more strict threshold, in order to confirm the present results after correcting for multiple comparisons across voxels. First, the control and ASD groups were collapsed, and the contrast of SO\u00a0>\u00a0SI was investigated in the alphabet task. At a threshold of   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons across the whole brain, there was just a single region of activation (medial rostral PFC: 2, 64, 28;   z  \u00a0=\u00a04.71;   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05). We then investigated regions responding more strongly to the SO\u00a0>\u00a0SI contrast in the ASD than the control group. No activations survived a whole-brain corrected threshold, but the group difference in medial rostral PFC was significant after correcting for multiple comparisons across a 20\u00a0mm sphere centred on the peak from the earlier orthogonal contrast of SO\u00a0>\u00a0SI, collapsed across the groups (10, 54, 36;   z  \u00a0=\u00a03.94;   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.025). Thus, the group difference in medial rostral PFC associated with the alphabet task was confirmed, even at a corrected threshold. \n\nInspection of   suggests differences between the ASD and control groups not only in the overall level of medial rostral PFC activation associated with the SO\u00a0>\u00a0SI contrast, but also in the location of activation peaks. Specifically, the peak medial rostral PFC activations appear to be relatively caudal in the ASD group, compared with the control group. In order to test for such differences, the peak medial rostral PFC co-ordinate for the SO\u00a0>\u00a0SI contrast was extracted individually for each participant (see  , for a similar approach). Medial rostral PFC was defined here as \u22128\u00a0\u2264\u00a0  x  \u00a0\u2264\u00a08,   y  \u00a0>\u00a040, \u221212\u00a0\u2264\u00a0  z  \u00a0\u2264\u00a030, as in our previous study ( ). Analysis of these data confirmed that peak co-ordinates were indeed more caudal in the ASD group than the control group (ASD: mean   y  \u00a0=\u00a052.9; control: mean   y  \u00a0=\u00a058.4;   F  (1, 31)\u00a0=\u00a04.8,   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05). However, a similar analysis of the medial rostral PFC peaks associated with the Baseline\u00a0>\u00a0Random contrast did not produce a significant group difference (ASD: mean   y  \u00a0=\u00a053.3; control: mean   y  \u00a0=\u00a055.1;   F  \u00a0<\u00a01). The results from the SO\u00a0>\u00a0SI contrast are illustrated in  , which displays regions showing greater activity associated with the SO\u00a0>\u00a0SI contrast in the ASD than the control group, along with results from the SO\u00a0>\u00a0SI contrast in an analysis where the two groups were combined. It can be seen that the more caudal medial PFC region activated in the subtraction between the groups is activated in the ASD but not in the control group. By contrast, the more rostral medial PFC region activated when the groups were combined shows similar levels of activity in the two groups. It therefore seems likely that the ASD group showed more widespread activity related to the SO\u00a0>\u00a0SI contrast than the control group. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study we administered two tests of executive function to a group of high-functioning participants with ASD and an age- and IQ-matched control group: a \u201cclassical\u201d test of random keypress generation, and a new test involving selection between stimulus-oriented and stimulus-independent thought (\u201calphabet test\u201d). Behavioural performance was similar in the two groups. In both tasks, the two groups activated partially overlapping brain regions, including lateral prefrontal and parietal cortex, which showed relatively high activity during the more demanding conditions (random sequence generation, and stimulus-independent cognition), and medial rostral prefrontal cortex, which showed relatively low activity during such conditions, compared with baseline and stimulus-oriented conditions. However, task-specific between-group differences were also observed in the neuroimaging data. In the random generation task, between-group differences were observed in the cerebellum and lateral temporal cortex. The alphabet test revealed more extensive between-group differences. In the contrast of stimulus-oriented versus stimulus-independent phases, the ASD group showed greater activity in medial prefrontal, temporal, parietal, and cerebellar regions, whereas the control group showed greater activity in distinct occipital and parietal regions. In addition, there was evidence that in the alphabet test the groups differed not only in the overall level of activity in medial rostral PFC, but also in the location of the activation peaks, with activation peaks in the ASD group being caudal to those in the control group. \n\nThese results suggest that even within the same participants, performance of different executive function tasks may be associated with functional abnormalities in different brain regions in high-functioning participants with ASD. Of course, it remains to be seen whether such results would generalise to less high-functioning participants. However, such results underline the importance of examining task-specific effects within the domain of executive function, rather than considering any single task as an exhaustive indicator of this domain. Furthermore, these results suggest that new tests of executive function, requiring selection between stimulus-oriented and stimulus-independent thought, may be particularly sensitive to atypical recruitment of rostral PFC, and functional organisation of this region, in participants with ASD. Below, we consider the results from the two tasks in greater depth. However, in order to interpret the present results, it is important first to discuss the issue of \u201cactivation\u201d versus \u201cdeactivation\u201d in functional neuroimaging studies. \n\n### \u201cActivation\u201d versus \u201cdeactivation\u201d in functional neuroimaging \n  \nIn the present study, each task consisted of a relatively demanding condition (random generation or stimulus-independent cognition), involving a relatively indirect link between stimuli and responses, and a less demanding condition (sequence generation or stimulus-oriented cognition) where responses were driven in a more direct manner by environmental events. In both tasks, and both groups, some brain regions showed greater activity in the more demanding conditions, whilst other brain regions \u2013 notably medial rostral PFC \u2013 showed greater activity in the less demanding conditions. The functional role of brain regions that show enhanced activity during low-demand conditions (i.e. that are \u201cdeactivated\u201d by relatively demanding conditions) is presently a matter of considerable debate (e.g.  ;  ). According to some authors, such brain regions may support task-unrelated processes (e.g. \u201cdaydreaming\u201d) that are suspended during more demanding conditions (e.g.  ). However, other authors have suggested that these brain regions play a functional role, for example by promoting attention towards the external environment in low-demand tasks (e.g.  ;  ). This hypothesis is supported by neuroimaging investigations of the relationship between BOLD signal in such regions and behavioural performance ( ;  ), along with neuropsychological studies showing impaired performance on low-demand tasks (e.g. simple RT) in patients with damage to these regions ( ). We therefore consider all significant BOLD signal changes between conditions to be potentially noteworthy, rather than restricting analysis to just those regions showing greater activity in more demanding conditions. \n\nA recent study by   suggested that brain regions exhibiting greater signal during relatively low-demand conditions, including medial rostral PFC, show attenuated activity in such conditions (or a \u2018failure to deactivate\u2019) in participants with autism spectrum disorders. In this study, participants either performed a demanding Stroop-like task ( ) or were instructed to passively view a fixation cross. Whereas the control group exhibited greater signal in medial rostral PFC during fixation than the Stroop condition, no such effect was observed in the ASD group. The authors interpreted these findings in terms of task-unrelated cognitive processes (e.g. self-referential thought) during low-demand conditions in the control but not the ASD group. The present results corroborate the findings of   in suggesting functional abnormalities of medial rostral PFC in ASD. However, our results do not fully support   interpretation of their findings. In the present study, the ASD group showed increased medial rostral PFC activity in the low-demand versus high-demand conditions, so there was no evidence for a failure to deactivate in either task. Moreover, the difference in medial rostral PFC activity between stimulus-oriented and stimulus-independent conditions of the alphabet task was   greater   than the corresponding difference in the control group (i.e. an effect in the opposite direction to that observed by  ). \n\nIn the terminology of   this could be described as an   enhanced   deactivation in the SI relative to the SO condition, rather than a failure to deactivate. These results suggest that medial rostral PFC activity differs between participants with ASD and control participants in a task-dependent manner, rather than ASD participants always showing reduced deactivation of medial rostral PFC in high-demand conditions. However, it is not possible to compare the present results directly with those of  . The present study did not include a condition such as \u2018rest\u2019 or \u2018fixation\u2019, because activity observed in such conditions may be difficult to relate to underlying cognitive processes ( ). It is therefore not possible to investigate whether the ASD group would have shown deactivation relative to such conditions (or not, as reported by  ; see  , for discussion of the merits and shortcomings of such low-level baseline tasks in functional neuroimaging studies). \n\n\n### Task-specific abnormalities in executive function \n  \nThe present results are consistent with recent evidence suggesting an uneven profile of executive function abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders ( ;  ). Rather than the two executive function tasks revealing consistent between-group differences, differences between the two groups were observed in different regions, depending on the task. Notably, only the new test of executive function (alphabet task) revealed frontal-lobe differences between the groups. Other functional imaging studies investigating participants with ASD have produced inconsistent results, with some studies indicating task-related increases in activity in participants with ASD (e.g.  ), some indicating task-related decreases (e.g.  ), and others indicating a combination of task-related increases and decreases in different brain regions (e.g.  ). These studies have also reported between-group differences in a variety of brain regions. The present results suggest that this variability can be attributed not only to methodological differences between studies such as the use of different participant groups, but also to task-specific differences. Even within two tasks sensitive to executive function, between-task differences were observed in the present study, within the same group of participants (see also  , for a similar result within this domain). \n\nIn the random generation task, between-group differences were observed in the cerebellum. Along with structural change ( ), this area has been shown to exhibit functional abnormalities in ASD in several previous studies, particularly those involving motor sequencing tasks (e.g.  ). Thus, the functional difference observed in the random generation task may have reflected the demands of this task to co-ordinate a sequence of random responses with the visual timing signal, rather than other aspects of the task (e.g. inhibition of prepotent response sequences, or switching between different random generation strategies). \n\nIn the alphabet task, the main region showing between-group differences was medial rostral PFC. Previous studies have indicated that this region plays a role in attentional selection between stimulus-oriented and stimulus-independent thought, in tasks such as the alphabet test which may be particularly sensitive to this form of attentional selection (e.g.  ;  ;  ). This region has also been implicated in multitasking and prospective memory (i.e. organising one's behaviour according to previously formed, internally represented intentions; e.g.  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). This anatomical link, along with the present evidence for functional abnormalities in this region in ASD, suggests that dysfunction in rostral PFC may, at least in part, underlie deficits seen in ASD in recent tests of executive function that involve multitasking and prospective memory, such as the Six Element Test ( ;  ). In addition, these results are consistent with previous suggestions that multitasking and prospective memory are reliant on attentional selection between stimulus-oriented and stimulus-independent information ( ;  ). \n\nWhereas medial rostral PFC showed greater activity related to the stimulus-oriented versus stimulus-independent contrast in the ASD group, the control group showed greater activity primarily in bilateral occipital cortex. This suggests that the control group were able to modulate activity in early visual cortex according to the attentional demands of the task to a greater degree than the ASD group. The stimuli were matched between the two conditions, suggesting attentional modulation rather than an effect of stimulus-category. This finding is consistent with the suggestion of functional underconnectivity in ASD (e.g.  ;  ), leading to a decrease in top-down modulation of sensory areas according to attentional demands. Further evidence consistent with such an account comes from the finding of a group difference in lateral temporal cortex in the random generation task.   argue that activity in lateral temporal regions is suppressed by lateral prefrontal cortex in order to prevent stereotyped behaviour in random generation tasks. The ASD group's reduced difference between baseline and random-generation conditions in lateral temporal cortex may reflect a reduction in such top-down modulation. \n\n\n### Functional organisation of medial prefrontal cortex \n  \nRecent studies have indicated considerable functional specialisation within rostral PFC ( ;  ). Two functions that have been associated with medial rostral PFC are stimulus-oriented attention (e.g.  ) and mentalizing ( ). However, a recent meta-analysis ( ) suggested that rostral PFC activation peaks associated with mentalizing were significantly posterior (mean   y  \u00a0=\u00a053) to those associated with other cognitive domains, such as multiple-task co-ordination (including prospective memory; mean   y  \u00a0=\u00a061), even though the mean co-ordinates of activation peaks were just a few millimetres apart. This suggestion of functional specialisation was confirmed in a study that crossed the factors of attention (stimulus-oriented versus stimulus-independent) and mentalizing (mentalizing versus non-mentalizing) in a factorial design ( ). Activation peaks associated with the mentalizing manipulation were found to be significantly posterior to those from the attention manipulation, within the same participants. Thus, even though medial rostral PFC has been implicated in both mentalizing and multitasking, it seems that these two functions may depend on separable subregions. In this light, it is interesting to note that the present study indicated differences between the ASD and control groups not only in the overall level of medial rostral PFC activity associated with the stimulus-oriented versus stimulus-independent comparison, but also in the location of activation peaks. Activation peaks from the ASD group were significantly posterior to those from the control group, suggesting functional re-organisation of medial rostral PFC in ASD. Moreover, the region of medial rostral PFC activated in the ASD group was more akin to the region previously implicated in mentalizing ( ;  ;  ) than the region activated in the control group. This raises the possibility that participants with ASD may recruit brain regions typically associated with mentalizing for the performance of other tasks (for further evidence of functional brain reorganisation in ASD, see  , who suggest that participants with ASD use atypical brain regions for face perception).

This study aimed to explore different characteristics of brain activation among target-oriented kinesthetic imagery (KI) and visual imagery (VI) in the first-person (VI-1) and third-person (VI-3) perspectives. Eighteen healthy volunteers were evaluated for MI ability, trained for the three types of target-oriented MIs, and scanned using 3\u2009T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under MI and perceptual control conditions, presented in a block design. Post-experimental questionnaires were administered after fMRI. Common brain regions activated during the three types of MI were the left premotor area and inferior parietal lobule, irrespective of the MI modalities or perspectives. Contrast analyses showed significantly increased brain activation only in the contrast of KI versus VI-1 and KI versus VI-3 for considerably extensive brain regions, including the supplementary motor area and insula. Neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum during VI-1 and KI was significantly correlated with MI ability measured by mental chronometry and a self-reported questionnaire, respectively. These results can provide a basis in developing MI-based protocols for neurorehabilitation to improve motor recovery and BCI training in severely paralyzed individuals. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMotor imagery (MI) is a dynamic mental state during which representations of a given motor act are internally rehearsed in working memory without any overt motor output . With the remarkable breakthroughs over the last two decades in the rapidly evolving field of brain-computer interface (BCI), MI has become important in rehabilitation research . The neural mechanisms underlying the process of MI demonstrate functional equivalence with motor execution (ME), with the two sharing similar physiological and anatomical characteristics . During MI, increased brain activity is observed at the premotor, supplementary motor, cingulate, parietal cortical areas, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, which are also the principal brain areas involved in ME . Brain activity in motor-related areas during MI can induce neuroplasticity and reorganization of neural networks and can be adopted to control BCIs in patients with brain damage or disabilities . In particular, for patients with severe paresis, MI may be used as the sole method to produce motor recovery of a paretic limb without overt behavioral output . \n\nMI essentially requires numerous sessions of training because many individuals cannot easily conceptualize MI . It is a counterintuitive task involving a broad spectrum of processes ranging from visual imagery (VI) to kinesthetic imagery (KI), first- to third-person perspectives , and non-target-oriented to target-oriented movements . In disabled patients who do not produce overt motor output, it can be especially challenging to generate stable and continuous brain signal patterns . For a wide range of MIs, an understanding of the particular brain activation patterns during specific MI can help naive MI participants modulate their brain activity effectively and proficiently for neurorehabilitation or BCI control . \n\nGenerally, MIs can be classified into two types: VI and KI. VI involves imagining visual images of task performance in the first- (VI-1) or third-person (VI-3) perspective, and KI involves imagining the sensation produced by actually performing the task . Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies for these three types of MI (VI-1, VI-3, and KI) have shown differential characteristics with substantial overlap among the MIs . Even though the results of these studies are useful in elucidating the physiologic mechanisms for enhancing the performance of BCIs or the effect of neurorehabilitation, MI tasks only consisted of simple, non-target-oriented MIs such as finger tapping and running. Since both BCIs and neurorehabilitation aim to facilitate functionalities using instruments in daily life, the selection of these tasks may have limited application. In real-world environments, functionality in daily living can considerably depend on individual ability to use instruments that enable disabled people to perform the basic activities necessary to reside in the community . \n\nTarget-oriented MI, which involves the mental rehearsal of spatial-motor actions toward a target object, has been gaining research interest because it affords the possibility of better performance in neurorehabilitation and BCIs. Previous studies using electroencephalography have shown that target-oriented MI can enhance beta-band event-related desynchronization and larger beta-band event-related synchronization with better classification performance compared to simple, non-target-oriented MI . Among fMRI studies, spatial patterns of brain activity for target-oriented MI can be differentiated with ME, motor observation, or simple MI using multivoxel pattern analysis . However, no published fMRI study has investigated the spatial differences of brain activity for subtypes of MIs including VI-1, VI-3, and KI of target-oriented movements. From a practical perspective, imagery for target-oriented movement, which can be the basis for functional activities of daily living, would be more appropriate than non-target-oriented MI as a task for motor recovery or BCI applications. \n\nMI performance and patterns of brain activity can vary depending on an individual\u2019s ability to form a mental representation of an action . In previous studies, pre-experimental assessments for MI ability were conducted to select good imagers by using self-reported questionnaires such as the Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ) or the Movement Imagery Questionnaire . Even though these questionnaire assessments are regarded as validated tools to estimate MI ability, they have limitations associated with the subjective assessments of participants on verbal rating scales . Mental chronometry is an assessment tool to evaluate the objective temporal congruence of the movement during ME and MI and is a reliable method to assess MI . Interestingly, assessment of self-reported questionnaires and mental chronometry have not shown significant relationship for any subscale or global MI ability, implying that these assessment tools reflect the multidimensional nature of MI ability and can be complementary . If the particular brain areas that are correlated with the results of a self-reported questionnaire or mental chronometry during target-oriented MI can be specified in fMRI studies, this information can serve as the basis for selection of good imagers and can be used to determine the expected spatial pattern of brain activation before fMRI. \n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the different characteristics of brain activation during target-oriented MIs between VI and KI in healthy individuals by using fMRI. We additionally aimed to investigate the correlation between MI abilities measured by a self-reported questionnaire and mental chronometry and functional brain activity using voxel-based analysis. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty healthy, right-handed volunteers (mean age, 31.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5 years, 10 male) without any neurologic or psychiatric disorders were recruited in this study. Among these, two participants were excluded because one had difficulty performing a KI task and the other participant showed brain structural abnormalities on the MRI scan. Finally, eighteen participants (30.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3 years, nine male) were included in the analyses. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital. All participants provided written informed consent according to institutional guidelines. This study was performed in accordance with all relevant guidelines and regulations. \n\n\n### Evaluation of MI ability \n  \nTo evaluate the MI ability of participants quantitatively, the KVIQ-10 and sympathetic skin response (SSR), surface electromyography (EMG), and mental chronometry assessments were performed. Before fMRI scanning, participants remained in a quiet room and completed these four assessments sequentially. \n\nThe KVIQ-10 consists of five simple gestures; the participants were asked to actually perform and imagine the movements after watching a demonstration performed by the researcher. The five gestures are forward shoulder flexion, thumb to fingertips, forward trunk flexion, hip abduction, and foot tapping. The participants self-rated the clarity and intensity of the MI of these five simple gestures by using a 5-point scale from 0 (no image/no sensation) to 5 (image as clear as seeing/sensation as intense as performing the actual movement) after imagining the gestures in the visual first-person perspective and kinesthetic modalities . \n\nThe SSR has been used as a reliable method to evaluate MI ability on the basis of the rationale that electrodermal activity during MI would be similar to the actual performance of the ME . It enables assessment of the quality of arousal and attention during MI. For SSR measurements, surface electrodes were placed at the palmar (active) and dorsal (reference) sides of the dominant hand. After confirming no response of electrodermal activity for 30\u2009s, the participants were instructed to conduct VI-1 or KI of hand grasping without ME. To avoid skin response adaptation, the interval between the trials was longer than 30 to 60\u2009s, and the total duration of the test did not exceed 15 min . The trials were repeated twice for each task, and the peak to peak amplitude (mV) and latency (ms) of the SSR were measured. \n\nEMG was recorded to confirm that there was no actual activation of hand muscles during MI to confirm that it was distinct from ME. Additionally, a previous study reported that EMG activity during KI can be distinguished from activity induced by VI and ME on the basis of signal frequency . Active and reference surface electrodes were attached at the first dorsal interosseous muscles and the first metacarpophalangeal joint, respectively. \n\nFinally, mental chronometry was performed by asking the participants to grasp their hands for a certain amount of time (i.e., 10, 20, or 45\u2009s). The experimenter randomly selected one of the three different time periods for hand grasping and only announced the beginning and end of the trial to the participants. After one trial of actual hand grasping, the participants were asked to perform VI-1 and KI of grasping their hands. During MIs, the participants counted the number of times they mentally grasped their hands and provided this information to the experimenter. The index of deviation from isochrony for VI-1 and KI was determined by calculating the ratio between the average duration of the actual and imagined hand grasping movements using the following formula: deviation index\u2009=\u2009abs (1\u2009\u2212\u2009(MI/ME)) . \n\n\n### MI training \n  \nThe participants underwent MI training to enhance their understanding, especially for distinguishing among VI-1, VI-3, and KI. The participants were encouraged to imagine grasping and releasing the target with the right hand. To control confounding factors that may affect MI, including the shape, size, and color of a target object, view of the first-person and third-person perspectives, and surrounding experimental settings, the participants were provided video images showing the action of hand grasping as a training guide. Two types of actions were used in the video images: grasping and releasing a green, rubber ball as a target object at 4-s intervals with a right human hand in a first-person perspective view (Fig.\u00a0 ) and with a robotic hand in a third-person perspective view (Fig.\u00a0 ). Particularly, to help the participants perform target-oriented first-person perspective MIs, they were instructed to imagine the following behavioral sequences: to identify the internal representation of the target, open hand toward the target, and gently grasp and release the target.   \nTask guidance and design for the fMRI experiment. Video guidance was provided during motor imagery training to all participants for the target-oriented visual imagery in the first-person perspective (  A  ) and third-person perspective (  B  ). Experimental block design and instructions during the fMRI experiment are schematically represented (  C,D  ). VI-1, visual imagery in the first-person perspective; KI, kinesthetic imagery; ME, motor execution; PC, perceptual control. \n  \n\nThe MI training consisted of four serial sessions. First, the participants actually grasped and released the target with their right hand every 4\u2009s while watching the video for approximately 15\u2009min. During the ME, they were instructed to stare at the images of a hand grasping and releasing and to sense the finger joints bending and stretching to prepare for subsequent sessions of VI-1 and KI. Second, the participants were asked to perform VI-1 while watching the guide videos for 15\u2009min, focusing on the visual images of grasping and releasing the target using their right hand. Third, the participants were asked to perform KI for 15\u2009min, focusing on the kinesthetic sensation of the finger joints bending and stretching toward the target. Finally, the participants were asked to perform VI-3 while watching the guide videos for 15\u2009\u2009min, focusing on the visual images of the robotic hand grasping and releasing the target. Additionally, the participants were instructed to alternatively practice on the perceptual control (PC) condition. This resting state without any ME or MI was used as a baseline condition and the participants practiced to familiarize switching between ME/MI and PC conditions in preparation for the fMRI experiment. Whereas the MI training was conducted serially from ME, VI-1, KI, to VI-3, the participants were able to freely switch among the ME/MI/PC tasks on their own during training sessions to easily recognize the distinctions through comparison of each condition. \n\n\n### Experimental procedure \n  \nBefore fMRI scanning, participants were provided with experimental instructions and auditory stimuli to familiarize themselves with the experimental settings, and the researchers ensured that the participants fully understood the MI tasks to be performed during the experiment. Since no participant responses were required during the scanning, the researchers checked whether the participants were awake and whether they had made any experimental errors (e.g., missing the specific condition in a session) at the inter-session interval. The experimental paradigm was presented with the Presentation software package (Neurobehavioral Systems, Davis, CA,  ). The participants were instructed to ME and MI for grasping and releasing the target with the right hand in the same manner with training during the fMRI experiment. The target object was only used during training sessions and removed during the fMRI experiment so as not to evoke tactile sensations which can substantially influence brain activity during ME. \n\n\n### Task design for the fMRI experiments \n  \nWe used all five conditions as a task block: (i) ME as the physical execution of grasping and releasing the target; (ii) VI-1 of grasping and releasing the target with the participant\u2019s hand while only focusing on VI and not on KI; (iii) VI-3 of grasping and releasing the target with the robotic hand; (iv) KI of grasping and releasing the target with the participant\u2019s hand while only focusing on KI and not on VI; and (v) PC as the baseline condition without any ME or MI. The block design was employed in a counterbalanced manner to avoid an order effect. This study adopted a balanced Latin Square design, allocating only four conditions in one session. A total five sessions were performed for each participant and each session consisted of seven task blocks. Among the five conditions (ME, VI-1, VI-3, KI, and PC), four conditions were included in each session. Thus, three conditions were performed twice and one condition was performed once in a session. Five trials of one condition were presented per task block. A total of seven blocks (i.e., 35 trials) were performed per condition, and the inter-session interval was 3\u2009min. One trial lasted 4\u2009s, and a task block lasted 20\u2009s. Rest blocks between the task blocks lasted 15\u2009s. Notably, the baseline condition, to which ME or MI conditions were compared, was the PC condition; the rest condition was not included in the analyses. Before scanning, the participants were provided instructions via a monitor through a back-projected mirror, and scanning was started in the middle of the instructions to reduce the scanning time. During the experiment, participants were provided with auditory stimuli of high- (1500\u2009Hz) and low-pitch (800\u2009Hz) sounds for 0.2\u2009s and a fixation cross for 3.5\u2009s as instruction aids. The high-pitch sound was used to signal the participants to open their eyes and see the instruction. The low-pitch sound was repeated 5 times within each task block to announce the repetition time point of the task since 5 trials for ME or MI were conducted every 4\u2009seconds in one task block. During the PC condition, the participants were not allowed to perform any ME or MI, but were provided with the low-pitch sounds to create an experimental environment equivalent to that of ME or MI conditions. Auditory stimuli were binaurally delivered via a headset. The fixation cross was used to signal the participants to close their eyes to remove any visual guidance or information during the tasks. Examples of the task design for the fMRI experiment are schematically presented in Fig.\u00a0 . \n\n\n### Post-experimental self-assessment questionnaire \n  \nAfter the fMRI experiment, the participants completed the self-assessment questionnaire that consisted of questions for the three types of MI. The items consisted of self-evaluated questions assessing the ease of performing MI and its consistency, which were rated on a 10-point scale from 0 (difficult/inconsistent) to 10 (easy/consistent), and for performance, vividness, controllability, interminglement among MI types, and interminglement with ME, which were rated on 5-point scales from 1 (very poor performance, no vividness, uncontrollability, no other type of imagination, and no overt movement) to 5. \n\n\n### Acquisition of brain image data \n  \nImage data were obtained using a 3\u2009T scanner (Magnetom Trio Tim; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard 12-channel head coil. We used single-shot gradient-echo echoplanar imaging sequences, with axial acquisition of 42 slices per volume with interleaved acquisition. The image matrix was 64\u2009\u2009\u00d7\u200964 mm ; voxel size\u2009=\u20091.9\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20091.9\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093.5\u2009mm; field of view\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm; flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0; TR\u2009=\u20093,000\u2009ms, and TE\u2009=\u200930\u2009ms. A total of 84 volumes were obtained per session. A high-resolution T1 image was obtained using the 3D Turbo-FLASH sequence, with sagittal acquisition of 208 slices. The image matrix was 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 mm ; voxel size, 1\u2009mm ; field of view, 250\u2009mm; flip angle, 9\u00b0; TR, 1,670\u2009ms; and TE, 1.89\u2009ms. \n\n\n### Data preprocessing \n  \nFunctional MR images were preprocessed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping tool (SPM12,  ). Slice timing correction was applied to adjust data for interleaved slice acquisition. All functional images were realigned to the first volume to correct motion artifacts with six rigid body spatial transformations. We resliced the realigned images and created a mean functional image, which was used as a reference image for the coregistration step. To spatially normalize the functional images to the standard template of the Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space (resampled at 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009mm ), the high-resolution structural T1 image, which was coregistered to the mean functional image, was normalized to the Tissue Probability Map template. The functional images were transformed to the MNI space by applying the deformation maps generated from the normalized procedure of structural T1 images to the template image. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, an 8-mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel was applied to the spatially normalized functional images. The artifact detection toolbox (ART,  ) was applied to detect fluctuations in BOLD signals and head motion in the functional images. Outliers were defined as volumes where the scan-to-scan differences in the global BOLD signal normalized to z-scores were greater than five and the head movement was greater than 2\u2009mm. The total proportion of outlier volumes was 0.33% (25 out of 7,560 volumes; 84 volumes\u2009\u00d7\u20095 sessions \u00d718 participants). Eleven participants showed no outlier volumes, and the maximum number of outlier volumes (seven volumes) was observed in two participants. Therefore, we did not remove the outlier volumes to avoid any signal changes in further analyses. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nThe preprocessed fMRI data were analyzed using the general linear model, as implemented in SPM12. During the first-level individual analysis, statistical parametric maps of the   t  -statistics were calculated for each individual using a boxcar function convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function without time and dispersion derivatives. The preprocessed individual functional images were high-pass filtered with a 128\u2009s cutoff period to remove the effect of low-signal drift. Additionally, the six head movement parameters derived from the realignment procedure were used as regressors of no interest. FMRI data of each session were modeled with four regressors of interest, corresponding to task blocks included in a session. All brain activity during the 20\u2009s time period of a task condition was included in the analysis. To identify the activated brain areas during MI and ME conditions, contrast images were calculated including (i) ME\u2009>\u2009PC; (ii) VI-1\u2009>\u2009PC; (iii) VI-3\u2009>\u2009PC; and (iv) KI\u2009>\u2009PC. Additionally, in order to investigate the activated brain areas among MI conditions, contrast images were calculated including (i) VI-1\u2009>\u2009VI-3; (ii) VI-1\u2009>\u2009KI; and (iii) KI\u2009>\u2009VI-3, and vice versa. The contrast images were used as the input data in group-level random-effect analyses using one-sample   t  -tests with age as a nuisance variable. Overlapping areas with brain activation were investigated using conjunction analysis (i) during all task conditions including VI-1, VI-3, KI, and ME in contrast to PC condition; (ii) during only three types of MI condition in contrast to PC; and (iii) during KI condition in contrast to VI-1 and VI-3 conditions . Statistical significance was set at an uncorrected   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 with a cluster-based false discovery rate correction of   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 . \n\n\n### Correlation between MI ability and brain activity \n  \nMultiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the brain regions showing associations between the results of assessment tools for MI abilities and the brain activity of MI contrasts for VI-1\u2009>\u2009PC and KI\u2009>\u2009PC. The KVIQ scores and mental chronometry indices were used as variables of interest, and age was used as a nuisance variable. Since high KVIQ scores indicate good MI ability, a positive correlation represents increased brain activity associated with good MI ability. Conversely, the indices of mental chronometry were multiplied by \u22121 because low mental chronometry indices indicate good MI ability. The indices of the VI-1 and KI subcategories of 10, 20, and 45\u2009s were averaged and used as variables of interest after multiplying them by \u22121. Thus, in mental chronometry, a positive correlation represents increased brain activity associated with good MI ability. Statistical significance was set at an uncorrected   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 with a cluster size greater than 20 voxels. \n\n\n### Behavioral data analysis \n  \nThe data for MI ability were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test for ordinal variables and a chi-squared test for categorical variables. The data for the post-experimental questionnaire were analyzed using the Friedman test, and post-hoc analyses were conducted using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with a Bonferroni correction applied, resulting in a significance level set at   P  \u2009<\u20090.017. The average scores and deviation indices of VI-1 and KI in the KVIQ and mental chronometry, respectively, were analyzed using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. The significance level was set at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05. Data analysis was conducted with SPSS version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### MI ability \n  \nTable\u00a0  shows the results of the MI ability evaluations, including the KVIQ, SSR, EMG, and mental chronometry, performed in this study. The average score of VI-1 in the KVIQ was significantly higher than that of KI (VI-1, 3.61\u2009\u00b1\u20090.78; KI, 3.03\u2009\u00b1\u20090.94,   P  \u2009=\u20090.014). Other evaluation methods did not show any significant differences between VI-1 and KI. The average scores of VI-1 and KI in the KVIQ were significantly correlated (  r  \u2009=\u20090.5088,   P  \u2009=\u20090.031), as were the deviation indices of mental chronometry (  r  \u2009=\u20090.791,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001). There was no significant correlation between the average scores of the KVIQ and the deviation indices of mental chronometry for either VI (  r  \u2009=\u20090.064,   P  \u2009=\u20090.801) or KI (  r  \u2009=\u20090.302,   P  \u2009=\u20090.224).   \nResults of evaluation for motor imagery ability. \n  \nValues are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation, or number (percent). *  P  \u2009<\u20090.05. \n  \n\n\n### Post-experimental self-reported questionnaire assessments \n  \nTable\u00a0  shows the results of the post-experimental self-reported questionnaire assessments for the three types of MI. There were significant differences for vividness (VI-1, 3.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.77; VI-3, 3.78\u2009\u00b1\u20090.43; and KI, 3.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.96,   P  \u2009=\u20090.022) and interminglement among MI types (VI-1, 2.56\u2009\u00b1\u20090.61; VI-3, 1.61\u2009\u00b1\u20090.61; KI, 3.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.88,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001). In the post-hoc analyses, vividness was significantly different between VI-1 and VI-3 (  P  \u2009=\u20090.011) and VI-3 and KI (  P  \u2009=\u20090.017). Interminglement among MI types was significantly different between VI-1 and VI-3 (  P  \u2009<\u20090.001) and VI-3 and KI (  P  \u2009=\u20090.001). Otherwise, there was no significant difference among the three types of MI.   \nResults of self-assessment questionnaire evaluations for the three types of motor imageries. \n  \nVI-1: visual motor imagery in the first-person perspective; VI-3: visual motor imagery in the third-person perspective; KI: kinesthetic motor imagery; MI: motor imagery; ME: motor execution. \n\n*P\u2009<\u20090.05. \n\nThe items for easiness and consistency of MIs were rated on a 10-point scale from 0 to 10, and other items were rated on a 5-point scale from 1 to 5. \n  \n\n\n### ME and three types of MI versus the PC condition \n  \nTable\u00a0  and Figs\u00a0  and   show brain areas that were significantly activated in the ME, VI-1, VI-3, and KI conditions in comparison with the PC condition. During ME, brain activity significantly increased in the left primary motor area (BA 4), supplementary motor area (BA 6), somatosensory areas (BA 1 and BA 3), and the premotor area (BA 6; Rolandic operculum). The left supramarginal gyrus, thalamus, putamen, lateral globus pallidus, and the right cerebellum (culmen and cerebellar tonsil) also showed significantly increased brain activity (Fig.\u00a0 ). During the VI-1 condition, significant brain activation was observed in the left premotor area (BA6) and the inferior parietal lobule (Fig.\u00a0 ). During the VI-3 condition, there was increased brain activity in the left premotor area (BA 6), bilateral inferior parietal lobules, left supramarginal gyrus, and right angular gyrus (Fig.\u00a0 ). During the KI condition, the brain activity of the left supplementary motor area, premotor area (BA 6; including Rolandic operculum), bilateral somatosensory areas (BA 2 and BA 3), left superior and inferior parietal lobules, and the supramarginal gyrus was increased significantly (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nBrain regions and coordinates of peak activations during motor execution (ME), visual imagery in the first-person perspective (VI-1), visual imagery in the third-person perspective (VI-3), and kinesthetic imagery (KI) versus the perceptual control condition (PC). \n  \n*Only the statistically significant (uncorrected P\u2009<\u20090.001 with cluster-based FDR threshold P\u2009<\u20090.05) values are reported. \n    \nBrain regions with significantly increased activation during the motor execution versus perceptual control condition at uncorrected   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 with cluster-based false discovery rate correction   P  \u2009<\u20090.05.

There was no common brain area showing significantly increased brain activity during ME and the three types of MI. Additionally, the common brain area was investigated with a more lenient threshold (uncorrected   P  \u2009<\u20090.005, and spatial extent of voxels\u2009>\u200910) , which showed brain areas exhibiting increased activation during ME and MI tasks (Supplementary Material\u00a0 ).   \nThe left inferior parietal lobule (  A  ) and premotor area (BA6; middle frontal gyrus,   B  ) as common brain regions with significantly increased activation during the visual motor imagery in the first-person and third-person perspectives, and kinesthetic motor imagery versus perceptual control conditions at uncorrected   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 with cluster-based false discovery rate correction   P  \u2009<\u20090.05. IPL, inferior parietal lobule; MFG, middle frontal gyrus. \n  \n\n\n### Kinesthetic vs. visual MI condition \n  \nIn the conjunction analysis among MI conditions, significantly increased brain activation was observed only in the KI\u2009>\u2009VI-1 and the KI\u2009>\u2009VI-3 contrasts; these common brain areas are shown in Table\u00a0  and Fig.\u00a0 , including the left supplementary motor area, premotor area (i.e., Rolandic operculum; BA 6), inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, insula, and bilateral supramarginal gyrus and cingulate gyrus. In comparison with VI-1, KI showed significantly increased brain activity in the left premotor area (i.e., Rolandic operculum; BA 6), somatosensory area, inferior frontal area, insula, right middle temporal area, cerebellum, including the declive and culmen, bilateral supplementary motor areas, supramarginal gyrus, superior temporal areas, and cingulate regions (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Material\u00a0 ). Compared to VI-3, KI showed significantly increased brain activity in the left premotor area (i.e., Rolandic operculum; BA 6) and bilateral supplementary motor areas. Significantly increased activation was also found in the left superior, middle, and inferior frontal areas; bilateral superior temporal areas, supramarginal gyrus, left insula, left putamen and pallidum, right cingulate region, and the bilateral cerebellum (i.e., culmen) (Fig.\u00a0  and Supplementary Material\u00a0 ).   \nBrain regions and coordinates of peak activations in the common brain areas during kinesthetic imagery versus visual imagery in the first- and third-person perspective conditions. \n  \n*Only the statistically significant (uncorrected P\u2009<\u20090.001 with cluster-based FDR threshold P\u2009<\u20090.05) values are reported. \n    \nCommon brain regions with significantly increased activation during both the KI\u2009>\u2009VI-1 and KI\u2009>\u2009VI-3 conditions (  A  ).

Statistical significance was set at an uncorrected   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 with a cluster size of more than 20 voxels. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study aimed to investigate the activation patterns of neural activity elicited by target-oriented ME and MI. Participants performed actual movements or imagined repetitive grasp-release of a target object with the right hand for four conditions: ME, VI-1, VI-3, and KI. During the three types of MI, the common brain areas with significantly increased activity were the left premotor area (BA 6; middle frontal gyrus) and inferior parietal lobule, which did not show increased neural activity during ME. Contrast analyses among the MI conditions showed significantly increased brain activation only in the KI\u2009>\u2009VI-1 and KI\u2009>\u2009VI-3 contrasts for considerably extensive brain regions, including the supplementary motor area and insula. Neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (BAs 11, 47) and cerebellum during VI-1 and KI, respectively, was significantly correlated with the MI ability measured by KVIQ and mental chronometry. \n\n### Common brain activations in the three types of MI \n  \nIn this study, the left premotor area and inferior parietal lobule showed increased activation for all three types of MI. These two regions were activated irrespective of the modality (visual or kinesthetic) or perspective (first-person or third-person) of target-oriented MIs for the grasping action; those may involve processes associated with internal representation, aiming, and grasping-releasing of the target object. In a previous study, the premotor and posterior parietal areas were included as action-specific activation sites for aiming, but not for simple actions such as squeezing or flexion-extension . This study indicated that motor acts, including preparation and organization of movements with specific action goals, and those involving movement simulation and object- or goal-directed tasks are the basic elements of functional organization in the premotor and posterior parietal areas, respectively. Another study also reported that the left inferior parietal lobule was critical to storing the hand postures required for interactions with target objects . \n\nHowever, the primary motor area was not observed as a common activated brain region in the three types of MI in this study. Although MI reportedly shares similar neural substrates of somatosensory-motor areas with ME, activation of the primary motor area during MI has been a matter of debate, as several studies have shown conflicting results . The premotor and parietal areas are most robustly activated compared to the primary motor area during MI, implying that these areas rather than the primary motor area may be better options for implantation of an invasive BCI . The results of the current study are in accordance with the previous finding in that the common brain regions activated by target-oriented MI training are the premotor and parietal areas rather than the primary motor area, regardless of MI type. Identification of activation sites and a thorough understanding of their physiological roles during MI training may allow proper site selection of electrode positioning for BCI implantation and could enhance the controllability of the BCI. \n\n\n### Kinesthetic MI \n  \nKinesthesia may include all levels of the organization of movements, including muscle tone, synergies, goal-directed movements, and action . It can necessitate mental representation for generating, integrating and perceiving kinesthetic sensory signals from position and planned action of the limb without actual movement and sensory input . In the context of neurorehabilitation, KI, rather than VI, has been recommended to promote better motor recovery and improve functionality in patients with neurologic diseases . In the current study, overlapping brain regions with increased neural activation in the KI\u2009>\u2009VI-1 and KI\u2009>\u2009VI-3 conditions included the supplementary motor area, Rolandic operculum, inferior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, insula, and cingulate gyrus. These brain regions, which are possibly engaged in the neural process of KI, were activated more extensively than has been observed previously ; it can be attributed to the complexity of the MI task, in that KI with target-oriented movement might demand more extensive neural recruitment compared to simple KI. Particularly, these brain regions included the supplementary motor area and insula, the activation of which occurs after MI training in stroke pateints . The supplementary motor area is a secondary motor area that is heavily interconnected with the primary motor area; it was believed to be involved in planning and pacing complex motor activities . Even though the mechanism is unclear, it may exert a suppressive influence over the primary motor area during KI by actively inhibiting the ME of the represented motor actions . From the perspective of BCIs, the finding that KI induced increased activation of the supplementary motor area compared to VI can be applied to MI-based BCIs, as the activation patterns of the supplementary motor area showed great predictive ability for imagined movement . In addition, activation of the insula may be involved in the integration of multimodal sensory signals for the generation of simulated actions, attributable to the kinesthetic components of MI . The insula can serve as the interface between body awareness and movement during KI by processing and integrating a wide range of sensory signals arising from the body to internally generate intentional movement . Further study is necessary to reveal the exact neural process underlying brain activation elicited by KI and to optimize KI-based protocols for BCI training and neurorehabilitation in order to facilitate the efficiency of motor recovery. \n\n\n### Visual MI \n  \nIntriguingly, no brain region in the occipital lobe was activated during VI-1 and VI-3 in contrast with the PC condition. This result may not be attributable to the difficulty of VI, since the subjective assessments including the KVIQ and post-experimental questionnaire showed that MI ability, vividness, and interminglement among MI types during VI are significantly better than those during KI. In fact, the involvement of the primary visual cortex and adjacent areas in VI has been a topic of debate in the literature . Even though previous studies have reported the predominant activation of occipital regions during VI , other published studies have indicated that the parietal regions (BA 7 and 40) can be highly activated with slight or no activation of the occipital regions, including the primary and secondary visual cortices . In this study, VI-1 and VI-3 showed increased activity in the inferior parietal lobule. The inferior parietal lobule has been noted to play a crucial role in the processing of visual information: maintaining attention on the targets and responding to salient information and new events, which can be relevant to the tasks of VI-1 and VI-3 . Particularly, in the present study, brain activity was increased in the left inferior parietal lobule during VI-1 and VI-3, but only in the right inferior parietal lobule during VI-3. These results were consistent with a previous study which demonstrated that the right inferior parietal lobule can have a determinant role in high-order body or self-representation, and abnormal responses in this region can cause the misattribution of self-generated actions to external entities . In contrast, the first-person perspective may result in strong left-hemispheric activation of the inferior parietal lobule in the current study, which may indicate that this region has a prominent role in programming self-movements . \n\n\n### Visual and kinesthetic MI abilities \n  \nA whole-brain regression analysis for MI ability and the activity levels of brain regions showed considerably different results for the KVIQ and mental chronometry. Analysis of brain activity in the VI-1\u2009>\u2009PC condition showed only significant correlations with the indices of mental chronometry, while brain activity in the KI\u2009>\u2009PC condition showed only significant correlations with the KVIQ scores. These findings are consistent with results showing no significant correlation between the KVIQ scores and mental chronometry indices for both VI-1 and KI in this study. A previous study reported similar findings in that the self-reported questionnaire results for MI abilities and mental chronometry data did not show significant relationship for any subscale or global MI ability . This may indicate that the KVIQ and mental chronometry reflect different dimensions of MI ability for KI and VI-1, respectively, and can serve complementary roles in differentiating between visual and kinesthetic MI in fMRI studies. \n\nInterestingly, despite the different types of target-oriented MIs, good imagers for KI in the KVIQ and for VI-1 in mental chronometry showed increased brain activity at the orbitofrontal cortex (BAs 11, 47) and decreased brain activity at the cerebellum. This different aspect of brain activation in the two brain areas was also reported by a previous study, which reported that healthy participants showed increased activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and decreased cerebellar activity after intensive MI training . The orbitofrontal cortex can be involved in learning or recalling sequential motor tasks with synchronization to external stimuli at regular intervals  During MI tasks in the fMRI experiment, the participants imagined hand grasping and releasing, sequentially, at regular intervals, accompanied by auditory stimuli, which may have led to activation of the orbitofrontal cortex in the participants. Conversely, we observed that the greater the MI abilities were, the more the cerebellar activity decreased. Even if the cerebellum plays a pivotal role in acquiring new motor routines, particularly in the early stages of the acquisition process , cerebellar activity can decrease as participants reach some level of automatization on the motor sequence learning task . This inhibitory effect of the cerebellum on MI was suggested by a previous study as was its opposing effect on the contralateral motor cortex during ME . The physiological mechanism underlying brain activity at the orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum during MI should be investigated in further studies, which will be helpful in distinguishing good imagers for specific types of MI with distinct patterns of brain activity using simple evaluation methods such as the KVIQ and mental chronometry, without neuroimaging modalities. \n\nThis study had several limitations. First, no participant was excluded based on the results of MI ability assessments; thus, poor imagers might have been included in this study. However, even though KVIQ, SSR, EMG, and mental chronometry were conducted to evaluate MI ability, classification of good and poor imagers can be an arbitrary distinction based solely on the results of a self-reported questionnaire assessment as in previous studies . Since individuals who need to be trained in using MI modalities can show low levels of MI abilities due to cognitive impairment as a result of brain injuries, inclusion of all participants irrespective of MI abilities may yield more generalized results that can be applied in actual clinical practice. Second, EMG was not measured during fMRI data acquisition to confirm no actual movement during MI sessions. Instead, EMG measurements were obtained during MI training sessions before the fMRI experiment to confirm that no motor unit action potential was observed during MI as the participants were being educated. After the EMG measurement, the participants were trained to simulate the three types of MI without any actual movement of their hand for 1\u2009h to adapt themselves in the fMRI sessions. Third, it was practically difficult to completely exclude visual component from KI during the fMRI experiment. The post-experimental self-assessment questionnaire showed a significantly high rate of interminglement among other MI types during KI compared to VI-1 and VI-3. Further study will be necessary to quantitatively measure and control the visual component during KI by providing feedback on the participants during MI training. Fourth, both KVIQ-10 and mental chronometry were performed only for VI-1 and KI in order to perform a consistent assessment. KVIQ-10, which should be conducted strictly according to the administration procedures, is an evaluation method solely for VI-1 and KI, and it was difficult to adapt for VI-3. \n\nIn conclusion, the present study revealed the different characteristics of brain activity during target-oriented MIs in healthy individuals by using fMRI. The common brain regions activated during the three types of MI were the premotor area and inferior parietal lobule, irrespective of the different modalities and perspectives of target-oriented MIs. Based on contrast analysis between each MI condition, significantly increased brain activation was observed only in the contrast of KI versus VI-1 and KI versus VI-3 for considerably extensive brain regions, including the supplementary motor area and insula. Neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum during VI-1 and KI was significantly correlated with MI abilities measured by mental chronometry and the KVIQ. The characteristics of brain activity during target-oriented MIs can provide a basis to develop MI-based protocols for neurorehabilitation to facilitate the efficiency of motor recovery and BCI training for severely paralyzed individuals. Further study is necessary to reveal the long-term training effects for more complex tasks of each type of MI to advance training protocols in the field of BCI and neurorehabilitation. \n\n\n\n##

To localize the neuronal substrates of this process, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted on 31 healthy volunteers. The state of anticipation was simulated by generating an uncertainty respecting the onset of manual foot tickling. Anticipation was characterized by an augmented fMRI signal in the anterior insula, the hypothalamus, the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area, as well as by an attenuated one in the internal globus pallidus. Furthermore, anticipatory activity in the anterior insula correlated positively with the degree of laughter that was produced during tickling. These findings are consistent with an encoding of the expected emotional consequences of tickling and suggest that early regulatory mechanisms influence, automatically, the laughter circuitry at the level of affective and sensory processing. Tickling activated not only those regions of the brain that were involved during anticipation, but also the posterior insula, the anterior cingulate cortex and the periaqueductal gray matter. Sequential or combined anticipatory and tickling-related neuronal activities may adjust emotional and sensorimotor pathways in preparation for the impending laughter response. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe anticipation of a sensation of tickling is considered to be an integral part of the mechanism underlying ticklish laughter ( ). Since the tickling that induces laughter is applied particularly to vulnerable bodily parts, it is initially anticipated as a potential threat. It may be reappraised as harmless during the actual stimulation, which is frequently associated even with positive feelings ( ). This circumstance is exemplified by a child\u2019s reaction to the menace of tickling, which involves an attempt to escape from it, screaming or laughter. Hence, the anticipation of tickling appears to trigger neuronal processes that are relevant during laughter. Investigations appertaining to the neuronal responses of humor and laughter have progressively targeted the focus of interest ( ;  ;  ), not least regarding their association with physiological parameters ( ) and the impact of affect-regulating pathways ( ). As yet, the inter-dependency of laughter and the related anticipatory processes has not been a subject of study. \n\nAccording to James ( ), the expectation of an externally applied stimulus involves the same centers in the brain as those that are related to its actual experience. During the act of stimulation, this mechanism would help to improve the efficiency with which the information is processed. For example, the primary sensorimotor cortices that are involved in the anticipation of touch and of tickling are similar to those that are implicated in the actual sensory experience ( ). The sense of touch mediates not only a discriminatory but also an affective dimension ( ), which, if sufficiently potent, triggers an emotional reaction. This response involves changes in heart rate, blood pressure, respiration and vocalization. In the case of tickling, vocalization is manifested as laughter. Hence, the affective response to tickling and the related anticipatory processes may be deep-seated in the same brain centers. \n\nEmotional reactions are driven by the so-called emotional motor system\u2014an ancient, involuntarily regulated pathway that complements the voluntary system [reviewed by  )]. The midbrain periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) is an important relay in this system; it is immediately implicated in the expression of emotions, including the control and the co-ordination of the motor neurons that are involved in laryngeal and respiratory movements ( ). There is broad scientific concordance in considering the PAG as pivotal in triggering vocalization in various species, including humans [( ,  ;  ), see also  ]. Laryngeal and respiratory vocal effectors are also controlled by the volitional motor system, notably, in humans, by newly developed primary motor regions exhibiting monosynaptic connections [( ;  ;  ), see also  ]. This situation permits the production of a flexible vocal repertoire including speech and song. By contrast, core processes for laughter as a spontaneous form of emotional vocalization appear to be seated in subcortical regions. This tenet is supported by the observation that laughter is vividly produced in infants at an early age, namely, by the fourth month. Furthermore, patients with bilateral damage at sites of the motor cortex that are associated with vocal control lose the ability to sing and speak while retaining the capacity to produce non-verbal emotional utterances, such as moans, cries and laughter ( ). The PAG is strongly interconnected with numerous brain regions that are associated with the limbic system, particularly with the lateral hypothalamus ( ), which is intrinsically coupled with the emotional motor system ( ). Investigations in the squirrel monkey suggest that the hypothalamus furnishes the most substantial input to implement vocalizations that accompany emotional states ( ). In the rat, the lateral hypothalamus is involved in vocalizations that are related to the expression of positive emotions ( ), notably to those that occur in the context of tickling and play ( ). In humans, the lateral hypothalamus is activated during the processing of humor ( ;  ) and of ticklish laughter ( ). Both the hypothalamus and the PAG receive projections from the insula ( ); the latter represents a primary cortical relay for tactile afferents that mediate affective information ( ). The functions of the anterior insula (AI) are believed to be implicated in the triggering of human laughter ( ;  ). Interestingly in this context, the AI not only senses the physiological condition of the body and related feelings, but also estimates the impact of an upcoming stimulation on this bodily state ( ,  ). Furthermore, the AI is believed to form a part of a limbic-related processing network that produces an affective state in response to the emotional significance of a stimulus, which is then automatically relayed to regulate emotional behavior [( ), see also  ]. Along these lines, activity in this cortical region occurs during the experience of tickling or a pleasant touch and during the anticipation of these sensations ( ;  ). However, a possible involvement of downstream regions, such as the hypothalamus and the PAG, has not been considered thus far. Our own investigations have permitted us to demonstrate activity that is associated with ticklish laughter in the AI/hypothalamic/PAG axis ( ;  ). However, in these former studies, no attempt was made to locate the sites of activity that are associated with the preceding anticipatory processes. It was with this aim in view that the present study was conducted. The partial brain volume targeted included the three aforenamed key nodes of the emotional motor system. By focusing on the AI, the hypothalamus and the PAG, we have now distinguished the processes of anticipation from those that are relevant during tickling. \n  \nSimplified model of efferent pathways for vocal control in humans. Brain regions are indicated in yellow when bearing reference to, or representing the emotional motor pathway, in green when being assigned to the voluntary motor pathway, and in lime-green when relating to the effectors for vocal output. The PAG is crucial for the control of emotional vocal expression via its connections with the nucleus ambiguus (laryngeal effectors) and the nucleus retroambiguus [respiratory/vocal coordination (Jurgens, 2002;  ;  )]. The PAG-activity is driven by the hypothalamus, which furnishes the main input for spontaneous vocal reactions ( ). The PAG is also a target of efferences from the ACC. The ACC is an evolutionarily older cortical site, which appears to support a directed expression of vocalization ( ). In humans, the functions of the dorsal ACC include emotional intonations that are superimposed on the production of volitional speech (Barrett   et al.  , 2004; Aziz-Zadeh   et al.  , 2010;  ; Dichter   et al.  , 2018). The AI cortex senses the current affective state and automatically relays the corresponding information to the emotional motor system ( ). The ventral laryngeal motor cortex (LMCV) is the homologue of the non-human primate LMC, whereas the dorsal laryngeal motor cortex (LMCD) is unique in the human primary motor cortex. These primary motor cortical regions extend the potential of voluntary vocal control, permitting flexible speech and song, notably via the reticular formation of the lower brainstem and by direct connections with laryngeal effectors in the nucleus ambiguus ( ;  ;  ). \n  \nList of Abbreviations\n   \nA condition anticipation of tickling \n  \nACC anterior cingulate gyrus \n  \nAI anterior insula \n  \nAID anterior insula, dorsal \n  \nAIV anterior insula, ventral \n  \nBOLD Blood-oxygen-level-dependent \n  \nEPI echo planar imaging \n  \nC condition foot contact (touching) \n  \nfMRI functional magnetic resonance imaging \n  \nFWE family-wise error \n  \nPGI globus pallidus internal segment \n  \nPAG periaqueductal gray matter \n  \nHYP hypothalamus \n  \nLMCD laryngeal motor cortex, dorsal \n  \nLMCV laryngeal motor cortex, ventral \n  \nMI mid insula \n  \nMNI Montreal Neurological Institute \n  \nNAC nucleus accumbens \n  \nPI posterior insula \n  \nROI region of interest \n  \nSVC small volume correction \n  \nSPM statistical parametric mapping \n  \nT tickling \n  \nThalamus A thalamus nuclei anteriores \n  \nThalamus CM thalamus nucleus centromedianus \n  \nThalamus VA thalamus nucleus ventralis anterior \n  \nThalamus VL thalamus nucleus ventralis lateralis \n  \nThalamus VP thalamus nucleus ventralis posterior \n  \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nAmong the 43 healthy participants, 31 (21 females and 10 males; mean age: 24.3\u00a0years; age range: 20\u201329\u00a0years) were included in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Three individuals were discarded due to technical constraints during the acquisition process. Nine individuals were excluded from the evaluation because their head movements consistently exceeded the limit of head motion, as revealed by the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) re-alignment procedure (see Supplementary Information: Participants). The informed consent of all participants was obtained, and the procedure was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University Hospital of Greifswald, Germany (BB63/10). \n\n\n### Behavioral data \n  \nAn fMRI-adapted fiber-optic microphone (MR confon, Magdeburg, Germany) was used to record laughter during the scanning procedure. The audacity\u00ae software 2.1.1 (Audacity Team,  ) was implemented to evaluate the intensity of the audible signal. Laughter always involves a strong expiratory component, which, in its weaker form, may be produced without articulation. The occurrence of a strong expiration without an accompanying audible vocalization was thus classified as an expiratory bout of laughter. Bursts of laughter that consisted of only one audible articulation were defined as weak; those involving several (>1) audible articulations that were produced in rapid succession were defined as strong. A further subdivision of the latter category was not possible, since strong bouts of laughter often ended in undefined audible phenomena. According to this approach, the intensity of laughter was assessed in an escalating form, which may reflect the underlying neuronal processes: in primates, the intensity of a single burst of vocalization is correlated with neuronal activity in the PAG, which is the critical region of its initiation ( ). Existing publications report on the correlation between the physical magnitude of the specific sensory stimuli and the exponential neuronal responses in the lower range of the perceived phenomenon ( ). Considering that in the present investigation we frequently reported expiratory responses without an accompanying audible vocalization (weak reaction, see Results), we here simplified the predicted exponential trend of the neuronal response that was elicited and coded the different intensities of bouts of laughter with exponential weights (expiratory laughter\u2009=\u20091\u00d7, weak laughter\u2009=\u20092\u00d7, strong laughter\u2009=\u20094\u00d7). For each participant, maximally 15 scores for the 15 tickling events were determined in this way. Calculation of the sum of these scores permitted a classification of the total vocal response that was produced during the tickling periods in terms of both the frequency and the intensity of the audible events. This value was used for the correlation analysis of this parameter with the anticipatory or the tickling-related activity. After the fMRI session, the participants completed a questionnaire in which they were requested to rate the mean sensation of tickling and the perceived pleasantness on a visual analogue scale, ranging from 1\u201310, with 1 being the lowest score (no sensation of tickle or pleasantness) and 10 the highest. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 21 (IBM) and Excel (Microsoft). \n\n\n### Experimental fMRI design \n  \nWe investigated the selected brain volume in the framework of an event-related paradigm with the following three conditions: (i) tickling of the right foot (T) by a friend or his/her partner. In this condition, the participant was encouraged not to suppress the audible vocalizations ( ). (ii) Monotonous foot contacts (C). (iii) Anticipation (A), which precedes the T or the C stimulus ( ). Upcoming episodes of T or C were visually indicated by the same \u2018smiley face\u2019. To prevent habituation of the person being tickled, the T and the C stimulations were executed with a variable delay (jitter) of up to 4.9\u00a0s (mean: 2.45\u00a0s; SD: 1.5), which represents the anticipatory activity (A). A jittering of successive stimuli also improves the evaluation accuracy in event-related designs ( ). A red bar, which was visible only to the tickler, was randomly superimposed on the left or the right side of the screen, at the end of the anticipatory period, and served as the signal to begin the episode of tickling (T) or touching (C). Each of these two conditions (T and C) was presented 15 times, each with a duration of 6.2\u00a0s and alternated with a baseline condition (11.2\u00a0s) in which participants had to look at a fixation cross. Technical and methodological difficulties are frequently encountered during the testing of a paradigm that is associated with physical motions. To minimize head movements and the associated artefacts in the fMRI signal, the participants held a wooden barbecue stick between their teeth, which did not interfere with the production of laughter ( ;  ). Since this procedure involves an exertion of the facial muscles during the entire scanning session, it may account for confounding brain activity due to smiling ( ) during T. \n  \nExperimental design. During the fMRI-scanning procedure, the participants experienced two different sensory stimulations, which were randomly applied: simple contact (C) or tickling (T) of the right foot. A visual cue signalized the upcoming stimulation, which followed only after a variable delay\u2014the phase of anticipation (A)\u2014of 0.1 to 4.9\u00a0s. To secure the unpredictability of the situation to the tickled person, the nature of the stimulation (tickling or touching) was signalized to the tickler alone by a superimposed red bar on the screen at the onset. The corresponding neuronal activity was measured in a defined brain volume, which included the AI, the hypothalamus and the PAG. A picture of a participant has been included, demonstrating the experimental set-up that was used. \n  \n\n### Acquisition of data \n  \nImaging was performed on a 3 T Scanner (VERIO, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 12-channel head-coil. Functional images were acquired using a T2*-weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence [repetition time (TR): 2\u00a0s; echo time (TE): 30\u00a0ms; flip angle [\u03b1]: 70\u00b0], which embraced the anterior insula, the hypothalamus and the PAG in 20 interleaved axial slices (resolution: 1.73 \u00d7 1.73 \u00d7 2\u00a0mm ; matrix: 64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 20 voxels; total acquisition time: 608\u00a0s). The frontal and the occipital poles were not included in this brain volume (see  ). A phase-oversampling strategy was implemented to avoid folding artifacts. To minimize susceptibility artifacts, images were additionally tilted by 30  relative to the anterior/posterior commissure [AC-PC line ( )]. For a gradient-echo field mapping, 34 phase and magnitude images were acquired [TR: 488\u00a0ms; TE(1): 4.92\u00a0ms; TE(2): 7.38\u00a0ms; [\u03b1]: 60 ; resolution: 1.73 \u00d7 1.73 \u00d7 2\u00a0mm ]. A T1-weighted, three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (TR: 1900\u00a0ms; TE: 2.52\u00a0ms; [\u03b1]: 9\u00b0; voxel size: 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1\u00a0mm ; matrix: 256 \u00d7 256 \u00d7 176 voxels; 176 sagittal slices) was used to obtain structural images of the brain anatomy. \n\n\n### Analysis of data \n  \nData were analyzed using SPM8 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, London, England) ( ), running on Matlab version R2012a (MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA). \n\nThe pre-processing procedure involved an unwarping of the geometrically distorted functional images (EPIs) in the phase-encoding direction using the FieldMap toolbox for SPM8. After slice-timing correction, each of the 304 individual volumes was re-aligned to the one which displayed half-maximal displacement (as indicated by the translation or rotation parameters with the highest maximal deviation) to correct for motion artifacts. Slow-signal drifts were eliminated using a temporal high-pass filter (128\u00a0s). Each EPI was co-registered with the T1-weighted anatomical image. The co-registered T1-image was segmented and normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template; EPIs were resliced at 1.73 \u00d7 1.73 \u00d7 2\u00a0mm . The resulting EPIs were smoothed with a 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6\u00a0mm Gaussian Kernel filter (full-width at half maximum). \n\nFirst-level analysis: to control for variance due to motions of the head, movement parameters that were estimated during the re-alignment procedure were introduced as regressors into the general linear model. The fMRI data were additionally adjusted for artifacts by a reduced weighting of motion-contaminated volumes using the RobustWLS toolbox ( ). An event-related analysis was conducted to separately identify the regions of the brain that were activated by the anticipation (A) and the tickling (T) stimuli in each subject. A reaction and neuronal conduction time of 400\u00a0ms after the request to effectively tickle was included in the modeling, which is shorter than the period that was implemented in our previous investigation (1\u00a0s), in which the participants could not prepare in advance ( ). We proceeded in the same way for the evaluation of the C condition. Contrast images were calculated to describe the comparisons T\u2009>\u2009A and T\u2009>\u2009C. \n\nSecond-level analysis: a hypothesis-driven SPM analysis was undertaken in a region of interest (ROI) that comprised the bilateral anterior insular cortex (AI), the midbrain and the bilateral hypothalamus. The anterior insular cortex (AI) was included with a view to relating regional activation patterns with the monitored and corresponding affective state ( ). The midbrain and the hypothalamus were included with a view to revealing the impact thereon of the behavioral reaction ( ). The AI was defined according to data that are presented in the Anatomical Atlas of Neuromorphometrics [SPM ( )]. The midbrain/hypothalamus was defined according to the Atlas of the Automated Anatomic Labeling (AAL) toolbox ( ). Functional maps appertaining to the conditions anticipation (A), tickling (T) and monotonous foot contacts (C) as well as to T   vs   A and T   vs   C were analyzed in the predefined ROI volume, based on a small volume correction (SVC) at the voxel level. Voxels were considered to be significant if they survived a family-wise-error (FWE)-corrected threshold (  P  \u00a0<\u20090.05) that was adjusted for the small volume. With a view to classifying activities in accordance with the results of our previous investigation on ticklish laughter ( ), the described evaluations were complemented with an explorative analysis of the brain volume which has been measured. Thus, in addition to activity in the AI, the hypothalamus and the PAG, that in the mid- and the posterior portions of the insular cortex, the basal ganglia, the thalamus, the anterior lobe of the cerebellum and portions of the parietal, the temporal and the frontal lobes were also evaluated. In this instance, the results for T, A and C, as well as for T   vs   A and T   vs   C, were reported at a significance threshold of   P  \u00a0<\u20090.05, which was FWE-corrected (voxel level) for the multiple comparisons involving the measured brain volume. \n\nA linear-regression analysis (implemented in SPM8) permitted a correlation between each participant\u2019s total (intensity-weighted) vocal output in response to tickling and the corresponding beta values (effect size) of the anticipation (A) and the tickling (T) events. The results are reported for the two aforementioned ROIs (anterior insula and midbrain/hypothalamus) after an SVC analysis with a corrected threshold of   P   (FWE)\u2009<\u20090.05 at the voxel level that was adjusted for the small volume. \n\nThe anatomical locations of significant areas of activation were identified using the SPM Anatomy Toolbox [(version 21 ( )] and the Atlas of the Human Brain ( ). The posterior and the mid, as well as the dorsal and the ventral anterior regions of the insular cortex, were distinguished according to the labeling patterns that were reported by Wager and Barrett ( ). To assess a potential impact of motion artifacts on the BOLD signal, scan-to-scan frame displacements (calculated by the sum of the six motion parameters for head movements combined over all volumes) were introduced as the regressor [see ( ;  )] in a further analysis of the A and the T conditions (  P  \u00a0<\u20090.001, uncorrected). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavior \n  \nSix of the 31 participants manifested an audible response to each of the 15 episodes of tickling; four exhibited no reaction whatsoever (median: 11). The intensity of an event of ticklish laughter was gauged as \u2018strong\u2019 (number of events: 0\u201315; median: 3), \u2018weak\u2019 (number of events: 0\u20134; median: 0) or \u2018expiratory\u2019 (number of events: 0\u201312; median: 3). The differences in intensity were taken into account in calculating the amount of laughter that was produced by each participant (see Methods). The average aggregated score per subject was 24.2 (\u2018strong\u2019 laughter: 4.71, weighted as 18.84; \u2018weak\u2019 laughter: 0.81, weighted as 1.62; \u2018expiratory\u2019 laughter: 3.74). With respect to this parameter, no significant differences were observed between males and females (Mann\u2013Whitney test;   P  \u00a0=\u20090.44). The participants rated the stimulus as \u2018pleasant\u2019 [mean score: 7.18 (SD: \u00b11.9) of 10; no significant gender differences] and as \u2018rather ticklish\u2019 [mean score: 5.35 (SD: \u00b12.1) of 10; no significant gender differences]. Ticklishness correlated with the amount of laughter that was produced (Pearson\u2019s test: r\u2009=\u20090.477,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.007). \n  \nGroup-related activity during tickling and its anticipation. Panel A: the anticipation of the affective stimulation (A) involved the AI, the nucleus accumbens (NAC) and the hypothalamus (HYP). In the illustrated example, the level of significance for threshold activity was set at   P  \u00a0<\u20090.001 (uncorrected). Panel B: tickling and the accompanying laughter (T) activated the mid (MI) and the posterior (PI) regions of the insula, the hypothalamus (HYP) and the PAG (  P  \u00a0<\u20090.001; uncorrected). Activation of the nucleus accumbens as well as of the anterior insular cortex is not represented. The right hemisphere (R) is indicated. \n    \nAnticipatory and tickling-associated activity correlating with laughter. Panel A: the AI cortex of both hemispheres was activated during the anticipation of tickling (A). In the illustrated example (  P  \u00a0<\u20090.001; uncorrected), activation of the AI in the right hemisphere involved not only the ventral (AIV), but also the dorsal (AID) portions. Panel B: anticipatory (A) activity in the anterior dorsal insula (AID) predicts the laughter reaction during tickling (  P  \u00a0<\u20090.001; uncorrected). Panel C: the scatterplot shows the relationship between the beta values (effect size) that were derived from the peak of activity in the AID of the right hemisphere and the degree of laughter (summed score of the weighted laughter bursts) that was emitted during tickling (r2\u2009=\u20090.43,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.001). The right hemisphere (R) is indicated. \n  \n\n### FMRI results \n  \nThe brain regions that were activated in anticipation of tickling (A) and those that were associated with tickling (T) could be clearly distinguished by their extent of activation in the insular cortex of both hemispheres. A was associated with activation in the anterior insula (AI), whereas T involved additional activity in its posterior (PI) and mid (MI) portions (  and  ,  ,  ). The anticipatory situation (A) was associated with significant activation in additional sites: the bilateral nucleus accumbens (extending into the putamen in the left hemisphere), the posterior lateral hypothalamus in the left hemisphere and the ventral tegmental area. During tickling (T), activity was likewise detected in the nucleus accumbens (extending from the putamen and the pallidum) and the lateral hypothalamus, but also in the thalamus, the amygdala, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the PAG, the brainstem tegmentum and the cerebellum in both hemispheres. The activity in the PAG appears to be localized in two longitudinally oriented columns ventrolateral ( ) to the midbrain aqueduct (see  ). Activation of the ACC was significant in the direct comparisons T\u2009>\u2009A and T\u2009>\u2009C and that of large portions of the pallidum in the comparison T\u2009>\u2009A (see  ). A closer inspection of the data confirmed an attenuated fMRI signal in the bilateral internal segments of the globus pallidus during A (24-10-4; z\u2009=\u20096.30/-24-8-6; z\u2009=\u20096.26, see  ). An analysis of the activity relating to monotonous foot contacts (C) revealed the response to tickling to be distinct from non-ticklish touch (see  ,   and  ). In particular, the involvement of subcortical regions was specific for the tickling but not for the touching condition. By contrast, during both forms of somatosensory stimulation, the right posterior superior temporal sulcus was involved, which points to the social dimension of both situations ( ). \n\nThe laughter score correlated positively with anticipatory activity in the dorsal AI on the right side ( ,  ). In the right midbrain tegmentum, it was related to episodes of tickling ( ). \n\nThe quality control revealed that when the individual summed motion-frame-displacement values were implemented in a second-level regression analysis, only a few voxel values attained statistical significance for condition T (cerebellum: z\u2009=\u20093.52, voxels\u2009=\u20096; putamen: z\u2009=\u20093.22, voxels\u2009=\u20096) and none for condition A. Thus, a major confounding effect of motion on the results can be excluded. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn our previous studies ( ;  ), the experimental set-up did not differentiate between anticipation of tickling (A) and tickling itself (T). It now appears that activity in the AI and in the hypothalamus is associated with A and with T, while that in the mid-posterior portions of the insula (MI, PI) and in the PAG is primarily involved in the T-condition. These findings accord with those of previous investigations addressing the brain representation of affective touch ( ;  ), namely, as appertaining to the distribution of anticipatory and stimulus-related activity in the insular cortex. However, in these former studies, no activity was revealed in the hypothalamus and the PAG, two subcortical centers that participate in an imminent behavioral response ( ). It is conceivable that, during the anticipation of tickling, an internal representation of the expected consequences is used and combined in a modified reaction to the actual stimulation. \n\n### The anticipation of tickling is associated with neuronal activity in the anterior insula \n  \nThe posterior insular cortex contains primary interoceptive afferences that the anterior portions integrate with cognitive and limbic-related information ( ;  ;  ). This process represents the basis of emotional experiences and has been associated with a broad spectrum of functional conditions ( ). The anterior insular cortex (AI) is believed to comprise a portion of the neuronal network that produces an affective state corresponding to an emotional stimulation ( ). Interestingly in this context, an anticipation of the averse consequences of a stimulus invariably leads to an activation of the AI and, at the same time, is associated with autonomous excitement and behavioral changes ( ). Indeed, the prediction of an affective state in the absence of a peripheral input appears to be a key role of the AI ( ). This observation may also apply to tickling or a pleasant touch: although activity in the AI has been observed during the sensory stimulation itself ( ;  ), this region appears to be specifically implicated in paradigms that signal an upcoming experience of the related bodily sensations ( ). Our data support the implication that the AI is involved in the anticipation of tickling (A). The functions that involve its right ventral portion permit the drawing of further conclusions. \n  \nMain effects of tickling (T) and of anticipation (A) and correlating activity of (A) and of (T) with the laughter that was produced during (T) \n    \nOne of the characteristics of tickling is that during the act itself, it is re-interpreted as a harmless stimulus. The continuous up-dating of information appertaining to the actual situation is assumed to be supported by the von Economo neurons (VEN) in the ventral portion of the AI ( ), which have been implicated in the rapid, highly integrated representations of an emotional experience ( ). In a previous study, the mechanism that underlies the recognition and the re-appraisal of humorous stimuli has indeed been explained by this process ( ). The ventral AI [agranular, see ( )] is functionally involved in an affective state that is generated according to an emotional rather than a cognitive input ( ). This region appears to be the seat of feelings that are not defined or interpreted ( ), such as those that are associated with the experience of one of the basic emotions ( ) or a state of intensified drive [e.g. the craving for food ( )]. The ventral AI also participates in the regulation of peripheral physiological changes that are related to affective states ( ). Notably, neuronal activity that is restricted to the right ventral AI signalizes higher sympathetic arousal ( ), as gauged, for example, by the concomitant change in skin conductance that occurs during the experience of positive emotions ( ). Moreover, in the rat, efferent sympathetic projections from the agranular and the dysgranular insular cortices have been traced ( ;  ). This discovery serves as more than circumstantial evidence of the insula\u2019s involvement in regulation via the sympathetic nervous system, which has been verified in humans: unexpected cardiac events following insular stroke are deemed to be associated with the sympathetic role of the right AI ( ). Hence, during the anticipation of tickling, the dextroventral AI possibly acts as a dynamic point of reference ( ) in the automatic regulation of the laughter circuitry. \n\n\n### The anticipation of tickling is associated with neuronal activity in the lateral hypothalamus, the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area \n  \nAn involvement of the lateral hypothalamus in human laughter was first suggested by findings in pathological situations ( ), relating, in particular, to those in which its tuberolateral portions were lesioned ( ) and has been confirmed by the results of our previous fMRI study ( ). The hypothalamus is anatomically connected to several regions of the brainstem, notably to the PAG ( ). It is deemed to stimulate the PAG to implement the motoric patterns of affective vocalizations ( ). However, our investigation revealed that, in the anticipation of tickling (A) the posterior lateral hypothalamus, but not the PAG was activated. In this context, it is of interest that a substantial proportion of the neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area of rats and monkeys respond specifically to appetitive or aversive situations themselves rather than to associated sensory or motoric processes ( ;  ). Also, the results of imaging studies in healthy individuals have confirmed the function of the (lateral) hypothalamus to be associated with the processing of the emotional valence of a stimulus ( ). Interestingly, experiments in the squirrel monkey have revealed stimulation of the PAG to evoke changes in the intensity, but not in the specific acoustic parameters, such as rhythm or the articulation of vocalizations ( ;  ). This finding is compatible with a role of this region in initiating and gating rather than in elaborating the vocal response. Hence, any anticipatory influence of the hypothalamus on the PAG (e.g. on the intensity of the vocal response) would become manifest only during the actual vocalization. Moreover, during the anticipatory phase, respiration is being imperceptibly adjusted to prepare for laughter, a process that always occurs in the post-inspiratory expiratory phase ( ). By its influence on respiration ( ), the lateral hypothalamus could play an indirect role in regulating the laryngeal voice box, perhaps via vocal pattern generators in the parvicellular reticular formation ( ). In addition, our findings reveal the anticipation of tickling to involve the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area. These regions support not only the processing of emotionally salient or rewarding events in humans ( ), but also the development of responses to predictive cues, at least in rats ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Laughter-associated anticipatory activity involves the anterior insula \n  \nIn those participants who manifested higher anticipatory activity in the dorsal AI of the left hemisphere, laughter was consistently more pronounced during the act of tickling (T). This finding implies an influence at a level of stimulus-encoding that relates to cognitive appraisal. In their meta-analysis, Wager and Barrett ( ) reported emotional situations in which undifferentiated affective states need to be translated into plans of action to be powerful predictors of activity in the dorsal AI [dysgranular, see ( )]. This region is activated in situations that implicate specific avoidance or approach strategies, for example, those in which an individual is attentive to painful ( ) or other incentive external stimuli ( ). Analogously, in our study, those participants who attached more importance to, or consistently anticipated the sensory stimulation, were probably more ticklish and accordingly more prone to laughter. As an example, an investigation of the neuronal correlates of touch by Lovero et al. ( ) revealed anticipatory activity in the AI to be correlated with that in a more mid-to-posterior region that responds during stimulation. This process would thus directly enhance the sensory response, if coupled, in terminal fields for primary interoceptive afferents. \n\n\n### Tickling with accompanying laughter activates an emotional and sensorimotor network \n  \nIn contrast to the anticipatory phase (A), the act of tickling itself (T) was associated with a more extensive pattern of activation in regions of the brain that included the PAG, the amygdala, the basal ganglia, the lateral hypothalamus and the insula. As far as this finding goes, our results confirm those of our earlier investigation on ticklish laughter ( ). However, in the present study, with an adapted paradigm, a more discriminative analysis was possible. Firstly, A and T likewise activated the anterior insular cortex (AI), whereas only the latter condition involved its mid-posterior portions (MI, PI). Evidence deriving from a variety of species indicates that the PI receives primary interoceptive information from the ventral posterior thalamus ( ). This region not only associates the incoming information with subjective evaluation in the AI ( ), but also projects directly to the same posterior thalamic region, as well as to the dorsolateral striatum ( ;  ). In humans, decision-making processes related to actions that are relatively automatic or habitual are mediated by neuronal circuitries involving the sensorimotor cortices and the dorsolateral striatum/putamen ( ). Moreover, the suppression of activity in the internal segment of the globus pallidus during A, suggests that the inhibitory input from this region to the anterior and the ventrolateral thalamus ( ) was restricted and that the motor-related functions of these thalamic regions were probably disinhibited. Hence, more direct and automatic processes may be implemented in the evocation of laughter. In this respect, our findings accord with existing data, which afford evidence that an involuntary ( ) and \u2018reflex-like\u2019 ( ) mechanism underlies the outburst of laughter in humans. \n\nSecondly, we found that T activated the ACC, which has both autonomic and emotional regulatory functions ( ). Referring to research on vocalizations in the squirrel monkey, the ACC is believed to initiate directed but not reflexive vocal behavior via its projections to the PAG ( ). In humans, this region has been implicated in the volitional control of the affective components of vocalization ( ), for example, when angry manifestations are produced on command ( ). In our previous investigation, this region was not activated during T. However, in the present study, the entire epoch of T was investigated, whereas in the previous one, only the early response to T was considered. It is conceivable that during the ongoing stimulation, an awareness of the social dimension of the situation sets in, therewith involving control functions in the ACC. This social awareness may serve to regulate the magnitude of the vocal reaction ( ) or, more subtly, to signalize social status by context-dependent frequency modulations ( ). The extent to which ticklish laughter involves obligatory control by the cortical centers is currently unknown. \n\nIn the present study, the neuronal processes that are initiated by the anticipation of tickling could, for the first time, be distinguished from those that are evoked by the act of tickling itself. It is conceivable that in a natural (non-experimental) setting, with its accompanying menacing gestural components, the equivalent anticipatory activity would be more potent and specific, eliciting vocalizations such as screaming and laughter. Moreover, some of the participants may have exhibited a tendency to react in a purely expiratory manner to T whereas others may have vocalized intensively when exposed to a comparable stimulation. To improve the characterization of the triggering processes of ticklish laughter, future fMRI studies could investigate, in parallel, multiple physiological parameters, such as changes in skin conductance, with a view to correlating them with the rated audible expressions. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe pattern of activity that characterizes the anticipation of tickling was distinct from the one that is manifested during effective stimulation. This finding modifies and extends James\u2019 contention ( ) that the same brain regions are involved during the expectation and the experience of an externally applied stimulus. Anticipation of tickling apparently evokes regulatory processes that are directly and indirectly coded in the emotional and the sensorimotor systems. In this way, the two pathways can be adjusted for laughter. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThe present work was funded by the Swiss National Foundation (grant no. 31003A-144036). \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n\n# Table(s)\n## ID: TB1\n### Label: Table 1\nActivated brain region\tUnnamed: 1_level_0\tMNI Coordinates (peak x y z)/Cluster size (voxels)\tMNI Coordinates (peak x y z)/Cluster size (voxels)\tMNI Coordinates (peak x y z)/Cluster size (voxels)\tMNI Coordinates (peak x y z)/Cluster size (voxels)\tZ-score\tZ-score\nMain effects\tSide\tT\tT.1\tA\tA.1\tT\tA\nPeriaqueductal gray ext. into Midbrain tegmentumCond.
