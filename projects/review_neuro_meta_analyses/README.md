# review_neuro_meta_analyses

In this project, we are reviewing neuroimaging meta-analyses. 

## Annotating in stages
We annotated meta-analysis papers in several stages:
- In stage 1, I annotated the imaging modality and papers to be excluded (e.g., because they weren't about the brain).
- In stage 2, I annotated the sample size and meta-analysis algorithm.

## Multiple datasets
The meta-analysis dataset can be found here: [https://osf.io/eu398](https://osf.io/eu398)

We also used an fMRI dataset for this project (found here [https://osf.io/uyh2x](https://osf.io/uyh2x)), but it is not in this respository because we did not do any annotations on it; we only used it to build a topic model.
