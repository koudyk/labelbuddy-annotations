# fMRI datasets
Annotating information about datasets used

## Papers

### How the papers were obtained
Typically with [pubget](https://neuroquery.github.io/pubget/pubget.html).
We recommend invoking `pubget` with the `--query_file` option, and storing a copy of the query file in the project's directory, or including a copy in the `README.md`.
