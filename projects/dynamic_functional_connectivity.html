We first calculated the ReHo using the data from the entire scan. <mark class="annotated-text">To calculate ReHoV for the Human Connectome Project data, scans were split into sliding time-windows, with each lasting 160 TRs (i.e., 1 min 55.2 sec) and 75% overlap between two successive windows. Then, ReHoV was defined as the standard deviation of ReHo across windows for each voxel. To confirm our results regarding ReHoV, we also tested different window lengths and overlaps</mark>. 

For the resting-state and continuous HCO task data, ReHoV was computed using sliding windows with 30 TR length (i.e., 60 sec) and 10 TR increment, as longer sliding window length will yield fewer …

### dFNC Analysis 

<mark class="annotated-text">A sliding window technique was used to estimate dFNC where windowed segments of the component time courses were used to compute transient functional network connectivity patterns (Figure  ). Sliding window analysis was iteratively performed with window sizes of 30, 40, 44, 50, and 60 s. </mark>Window sizes were selected based on previous studies indicating functional connectivity can be robustly estimated using a window size between 30 and 60 s ( ,  ), as well as previous implementation of …

### Sliding window correlation analysis 

<mark class="annotated-text">The sliding window analysis was performed using custom Python ( ) scripts. The data were split into 40 s Gaussian moving windows, staggered by one repetition time, created using a Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 8 s (see   for a detailed discussion of the sliding window methodology).</mark> This time period has been shown to be appropriate for characterizing dynamic functional connectivity  and provides a fine-grained picture of temporal changes in connectivity.

<mark class="annotated-text">Recent studies have shown that FNC has dynamic properties ( ).

Then, these windowed FNC matrices are used to identify recurring patterns of whole-brain connectivity via   k  -means clustering, yielding distinct ‘states’ (see   for further details). </mark>The optimal number of clusters can be estimated based on objective criteria like the elbow criterion that reflects the ratio of within- to between-cluster distances while testing for different numbers…

#### Time-resolved functional connectivity. 

<mark class="annotated-text">To estimate time-resolved functional connectivity (Hutchison et al.,  ; Sakoğlu et al.,  ) between the 375 ROIs, we used the multiplication of temporal derivatives approach (MTD;  ; Shine et al.,  ). The MTD is computed by calculating the pointwise product of temporal derivative of pairwise time series ( ). To reduce the contamination of high-frequency noise in the time-resolved connectivity data, the MTD is averaged by calculating the mean value over a temporal window,   w  . Time-resolved functional connectivity was calculated between all 375 brain regions by using the MTD within a sliding temporal window of 15 time points (33 seconds at 2.2 s per window), which allowed for estimates of signals amplified at approximately 0.1 Hz. Individual functional connectivity matrices were then calculated within each temporal window, thus generating an unthresholded (i.e., signed and weighted) three-dimensional adjacency matrix (region × region × time) for each participant.</mark> The MTD for the pairwise interaction between region   i   and   j   is defined according to  : where   dt   is the first temporal derivative of the   i   or   j   time series at time   t  ,   σ   is …
