To possibly determine whether a similar frequency specificity exists across different functional connectivity SMN states, and to capture spontaneous transitions between them, we investigated the dynamic spectral changes of the SMN functional connectivity in KS patients with and without MM symptom. Brain MRI data were acquired at 3 Tesla in 39 KS patients (32 without MM, KSMM-, seven with MM, KSMM+) and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy control (HC) individuals. The imaging protocol included 20-min rs-fMRI scans enabling detailed spectro-temporal analyses of large-scale functional connectivity brain networks. Group independent component analysis was used to extract the SMN. A sliding window approach was used to extract the dynamic spectral power of the SMN functional connectivity within the canonical physiological frequency range of slow rs-fMRI signal fluctuations (0.01–0.25 Hz). K-means clustering was used to determine (and count) the most recurrent dynamic states of the SMN and detect the number of transitions between them. Two most recurrent states were identified, for which the spectral power peaked at a relatively lower (state 1) and higher (state 2) frequency. Compared to KS patients without MM and HC subjects, the SMN of KS patients with MM displayed significantly larger spectral power changes in the slow 3 canonical sub-band (0.073–0.198 Hz) and significantly fewer transitions between state 1 (less recurrent) and state 2 (more recurrent). These findings demonstrate that the presence of MM in KS patients is associated with reduced spontaneous transitions of the SMN between dynamic functional connectivity states and a higher recurrence and an increased spectral power change of the high-frequency state. These results provide novel information about the large-scale brain functional dynamics that could help to understand the pathologic mechanisms of bimanual synkinesis in KS syndrome and, potentially, other neurological disorders where MM may also occur. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe occurrence of involuntary hand movements that mirror a voluntary movement of the contralateral hand, a neurological symptom referred to as bimanual synkinesis or mirror movement (MM), is considered physiological only during childhood (up to the age of 10) ( ). However, it could persist during adulthood in congenital conditions like Kallmann syndrome (KS). An imbalance of the developing brain motor circuit has been suggested as a possible cause for reduced suppression of involuntary contralateral hand movements ( ;  ). \n\nIn a previous resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) multi-center study on KS ( ), the presence of the MM symptom was found to be associated with abnormal spectral changes in the static functional connectivity (sFC) of the large-scale sensorimotor network (SMN). More specifically, a relatively lower contribution of the so called “slow-5” frequency band (0.01–0.027 Hz) together with a relatively higher contribution of the so called “slow-3” frequency band (0.073–0.198 Hz), has been reported from the spectral analysis of the spontaneous fluctuations of the SMN time-course, in KS patients with MM (MM+) compared to KS patients without MM (MM−). These effects were further characterized in terms of imbalance between cortical-cortical functional connectivity (more prevalent in the slow five band) and cortical-subcortical functional connectivity (more prevalent in the slow three band) to explain the reduced suppression of involuntary contra-lateral hand movements systematically occurring in MM+ patients when voluntary hand movement is requested. \n\nHowever, as the human brain is a highly dynamic system, the resting-state functional connectivity has been largely proven to be temporally varying ( ). That is, temporal fluctuations in the functional connectivity of a large-scale functional network, such as the SMN, may also reflect dynamic changes in the corresponding domain-specific functional connectivity with possible non-stationary switching between two or more discrete recurrent patterns or states. This has posed the natural question about whether the previously highlighted spectral signature of the MM symptom in KS patients constitutes an intrinsic stationary feature of the SMN functional connectivity, most likely secondary to abnormal anatomical structures within the motor circuitry, or, rather, is itself subject to dynamic temporal fluctuations between recurrent states, provided that a sufficiently long period of time (e.g., 20 min or more) is used for the observation ( ). In other words, it is not known whether the functional connectivity of SMN can exhibit more than one recurrent (patho)physiological states, whose dynamic features, such as, e.g., the different contributions to the dynamic spectral changes in the canonical frequency bands, appear under- or over-represented in KS subjects manifesting the MM symptom. \n\nAs previous results were obtained with a purely static FC analytic approach, i.e., observing rs-fMRI signals from a large-scale network over a typical, yet short, period of 5–10 min, the current study aimed at verifying if a dynamic FC (dFC) analysis, and more specifically a dynamic spectral power analysis of the network-specific amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, would also disclose similar characteristic dFC features in KS patients with MM. \n\nThe most common and straightforward way to investigate dFC is using windowed FC ( ), which consists of calculating a given FC measure over consecutive and overlapping segments of the rs-fMRI time-course data (e.g., 1–2 min), thus providing a time series of FC values, which can subsequently be used to assess dynamic fluctuations in FC over a substantially longer rs-fMRI session (e.g., 20–30 min). Such dFC analysis would also allow to identify the presence of recurrent spectral patterns for a given large-scale brain network, i.e., two (or more) dFC states with different spectral characteristics of the network time-course of activity, between pairs of which the same network spontaneously fluctuates over time. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this would be the first rs-fMRI study investigating, with such a spectral dFC approach, the possible spectral dFC correlates of MM in KS patients, thus potentially gathering new insights into the more dynamic aspects of the cerebral motor circuitry derangement associated with the clinical manifestation of the bimanual synkinesis. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subjects and experimental design \n  \nThirty-nine patients with KS (38 male, mean age ± SD 32.53 ± 11.61 and one female, age 13) were enrolled for this study. All patients met the diagnostic criteria for KS, based on clinical findings and smell analysis (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hypo/anosmia). The study was approved in accordance with the requirements of the local Ethical Committee at the University Hospital “San Giovanni Di Dio e Ruggi D’Aragona” of Salerno and written informed consent was obtained from patients or their parents. All KS patients underwent a complete physical and neurological examination including the evaluation of handedness and the evaluation of MM according to   criteria. In particular MM were scored as follows: “0” absent; “1” barely discernible but repetitive movements; “2” either slight but sustained movement or stronger but briefer repetitive movement; “3” strong and sustained repetitive movement; “4” movement equal to that observed in the intended hand: this phenomenon may be prevalent on the right hand or on the left one. In this way, subjects were divided into two groups: KS patients with MM (KSMM+, mean age ± SD: 34.86 ± 16.94) and KS patients without MM (KSMM–, mean age ± SD: 31.41 ± 10.73). Thus, we have 7 KSMM + and 32 KSMM–. We also scanned 26 healthy age-matched control subjects without MM. \n\n reports the full demographical and clinical profile of all KS patients including type of olfactory dysfunction (anosmia/hyposmia), handedness, clinical MRI abnormalities, grade (0–4) of MM separately for right and left hand and with side preference of MM. \n  \nPatients’ clinical profile. \n    \n\n### Magnetic resonance imaging acquisition \n  \nMRI image data sets were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens, Erlangen Germany) equipped with a 20-channel radiofrequency receive head coil. The imaging protocol consists of a volumetric anatomical scan, followed by resting-state fMRI scan. \n\nThe anatomical scans were performed with a 3D T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE) with TR/TE: 2400/2.25 ms; resolution: 1 mm; matrix size: 256 × 256. Resting-state fMRI scans consisted of 1,800 volumes and 44 slices, performed with a gradient-echo echo planar imaging (GRE-EPI) with a multiband factor of 4 ( ;  ;  ), TR/TE: 662/30 ms, matrix size: 64 × 64; voxel size: 3 × 3 × 3 mm , direction of phase encoding acquisition anterior-posterior. The same GRE-EPI series was repeated two more times with only five dynamic scans and opposite phase encoding directions (anterior-posterior, posterior-anterior) for the purpose to correct GRE-EPI image distortion ( ;  ). Each scanning acquisition was about 25 min long: 20 min for functional imaging and 5 min for anatomical imaging. During the functional scan, subjects were asked to simply stay motionless and awake. \n\n\n### Functional magnetic resonance imaging data preprocessing \n  \nEach individual resting-state fMRI time series was first corrected for the different slice scan acquisition times (  via   cubic spline interpolation) and for rigid head motion effects (  via   realignment of all volumes to the first) using BrainVoyager QX (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, Netherlands ). Subsequently, the image time series were first exported to NIFTI format for geometrical distortion correction   via   the TOPUP tool of FSL ( ;  ). Then, the subsequent preprocessing steps were performed on distortion-corrected NIFTI images using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) ( ),  which is based on Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)  and on the toolbox for Data Processing and Analysis of Brain Imaging (DPABI) ( ).  The alignment of the first volume of each subject resting-state fMRI series to the corresponding anatomical 3D-T1w image was implemented with affine transformation; then, all T1w images were normalized to the MNI space with the non-linear diffeomorphic DARTEL approach ( ); lastly, the coregistered functional data were normalized to the MNI space with the transformations obtained during the DARTEL procedure. \n\nTo reduce the residual effects of head motion, as well as the effects of respiratory and cardiac signals, second-order motion and physiological nuisance correction were performed using a linear regression approach: the regression model included 24 motion-related predictors ( ), with six head motion parameter time-series, their first-order derivatives and the 12 corresponding squared parameter time-series; the mean time-courses from a white matter mask and a cerebrospinal fluid mask (as obtained from 3D-T1w spatial segmentation) were added as two additional predictors. In order to account for residual motion-related spikes, an additional spike-related regressor was created from the frame wise displacement time-series, i.e., a predictor with a value of 1 at the time points of each detected spike and a value of 0 elsewhere ( ;  ). Finally, the image time series were band-pass filtered between 0.01 and 0.5 Hz and spatially smoothed with an isotropic 6-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. \n\nTo minimize the potential effects of head motion and possibly exclude subjects exhibiting excessive amounts of motion, we applied severe inclusion criteria: the six estimated head motion parameters (three translation and three rotation) were considered and subjects exhibiting head translations >3 mm and/or head rotations >3 degrees were excluded from consecutive analyses. Then, the mean frame wise displacement value (FD) was estimated as an additional measure of total instantaneous head motion ( ;  ) and the percentage of spike-corrupted volumes in each time-series was calculated. Potential spike-corrupted volumes were identified where the FD value exceeded a threshold of 0.5 mm; at this stage, subjects for whom the percentage of corrupted volumes exceeded 50% in the scan were also excluded from the analyses. \n\n\n### Functional magnetic resonance imaging data analysis \n  \nData were decomposed into functional networks using a group-level spatial ICA as implemented in the Group ICA (GICA) of functional MRI Toolbox (GIFT)  ( ;  ). The number of components to be extracted was estimated from the resting-state fMRI data using the minimum description length (MDL) criterion ( , ) applied to the concatenated data set of patients and healthy controls, ensuring the same number of components for all the patients and healthy controls. Prior to data reduction, voxel-wise variance normalization was applied to the time course of each voxel ( ;  ). Then, two data reduction steps of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were performed (subject-specific and group-level) using the expectation maximization algorithm and the independent components were extracted using the Infomax algorithm ( ;  ) and repeated 20 times through ICASSO ( ); finally, the GICA back reconstruction algorithm ( ;  ) provided participant’s spatial maps and their corresponding time courses. \n\nFor the dFC analysis, a sliding window approach was performed through custom scripts written in MATLAB R2021a (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, United States ) to explore time-varying changes of FC within the individual network components during functional MRI acquisitions. More in details, three hundred and thirty-one tapered sliding windows were obtained by segmenting the time-course of each subject into windows 150 volumes (150 TR = 99.3 s) with a step of five volumes (5 TR = 3.31 s). In fact, a window size between 30 s and 1 min was shown to be a reasonable choice for capturing brain dynamics ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Using the time-series data of all selected independent component pairs within each window, a pairwise covariance matrix was calculated. \n\nSpectral power information was obtained using the time-course of activity corresponding to the selected individual independent component. Following  , we further subdivided the relative contribution of each independent component time-course spectrum to the whole detectable frequency range into four separate bands ( ). The cross-spectrum was calculated in MATLAB over the entire low-frequency range of interest (0.01–0.25 Hz)   via   the cross-spectrogram function by specifying a Hamming sliding window. As a result, a dynamic spectrum connectivity (DSC) matrix was obtained, representing the changes in the amplitude of the time-course of network activity as a function of time over the entire duration of the scan. For the purposes of this study, only the SMN component was selected and considered. However, as the SMN connectivity may variably include the contribution from the subcortical structures, an additional region of interest (ROI) based analysis of the dynamic functional connectivity was performed on the fMRI signals from the basal ganglia and thalamus. Namely, using the Harvard–Oxford subcortical structural atlas (with 2 mm resolution) distributed with the FMRIB Software Library, we anatomically subdivided the basal ganglia into caudate, putamen and pallidum ( ) and downsampled the resulting mask to the size of fMRI data (3 mm). \n  \nFrequency range for the four canonical bands. \n  \nTo assess recurrent dFC patterns over time, a k-means clustering algorithm was performed to the windowed DSC matrix ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ). The k-means clustering was applied twice: first, to find the optimal number of clusters   via   silhouette criterion, and second, to perform clustering analysis with the obtained cluster optimal number ( ;  ;  ). The frequency of each state was estimated for each subject as the proportion of windows assigned to a state (cluster). The number of transitions between different states was also calculated for each subject. Then, a one-way ANOVA analysis of both frequency and transitions was performed considering the group as a between-subject factor with three levels: KSMM+, KSMM- and healthy controls. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nNo significant differences were found between HC subjects and KS patients and between the two KS subgroups (MM−, MM+) in age and gender. None of the enrolled subjects were excluded from the analysis as all passed the inclusion criteria used for the inter- and intra-voxel residual motion effects. \n\nFrom the GICA analysis, 13 components were extracted among which the SMN component was selected as the one whose spatial map exhibited highest z values bilaterally in the primary and supplementary motor areas and in the primary and secondary sensory cortices (  and  ). \n  \nResults of GICA analysis.

For the two states, the mean spectral power (vs. frequency) in the range between 0.01 and 0.25 Hz and the box plot of the mean spectral power in the four canonical frequency bands across all subjects are displayed in  . According to the peak frequency of the mean spectral power of each state, state 1 was descriptively identified as a low-frequency dFC state, whereas state 2 was descriptively identified as a high-frequency dFC state. Indeed, across all subjects, the mean spectral power was significantly higher for state 1 vs. state 2 in the lowest frequency canonical band (slow 5: one-sample paired   t  -test,   p   < 0.0001) whereas the opposite held true for the other canonical bands (slow 4 and slow 3: one-sample paired   t  -test,   p   < 0.0001; slow 2: one-sample   t  -test,   p   < 0.01). \n  \nSpectral analysis for two clusters of most recurrent dFC states: State 1, State 2. Left: for the two states, the mean logarithm of the spectral power (vs. frequency) in the range between 0.01 and 0.25 Hz was calculated. According to the peak frequency, state 1 was descriptively identified as a low-frequency dFC state, whereas state 2 was descriptively identified as a high-frequency dFC state. Right: Box plot of the mean log spectral power in the four canonical frequency bands across all subjects. \n  \nFor each canonical frequency band and each experimental group (HC, MM−, MM+), the percent signal change in the mean spectral power associated in average with any transition between two dFC states across two adjacent time windows was estimated. The corresponding boxplots are displayed in  . \n  \nBoxplots of the percent signal change in the mean log spectral power associated with transitions between two dFC states for each canonical frequency band and each experimental group. \n  \nThe percent spectral power change associated with the transitions from state 1 to state 2 was negative for slow 5 and positive for slow 4, slow 3, and slow 2. The percent spectral power change for slow 3 band was significantly increased in the group of MM + patients (and about double in size) compared to both MM− patients (two-sample   t  -test,   p   = 0.0013) and HC subjects (two-sample   t  -test,   p   = 0.0015). \n\nFor each subject, both the frequency of occurrence of each state, i.e., independently of the mean spectral power in predefined canonical bands, and the frequency of state transitions between the two states were counted. The box plots of these counts across experimental groups are displayed in the  . While the number (count) of time windows associated with each state did not significantly differ between groups or between states, there was a significant group-by-state interaction (2-way ANOVA,   p   = 0.04). Moreover, even if   post hoc t  -test revealed no significant differences in the counts between subgroups (in both states), there was a significant reduction in the number of transitions between states in MM+ patients compared to both HC subjects (two-sample   t  -test:   p   = 0.001) and MM− patients (two-sample   t  -test,   p   = 0.013). \n  \nLeft and middle: box plots of the frequency of occurrence in the state 1 and state 2 for each experimental group. Right: box plot of the frequency of state transitions between the two states. \n  \nFrom the basal ganglia and thalamus ROI analysis, for each frequency band, each group (HC, MM−, MM+) and each ROI, the percent signal change in the mean spectral power associated in average with any transition between two dFC states across two adjacent time windows was also estimated but no significant differences were revealed. Finally, for each subject and each ROI, both the frequency of occurrence of each state and the frequency of state transitions between the two states were counted. One-way ANOVA analysis from basal ganglia and thalamus ROI analyses revealed no significant differences in the number of transitions between groups. In each state, there were no significant differences in term of the frequency of the occurrences (count of time windows associated with each state). Moreover, in the same regions, there were no significant group-by-state interactions (2-way ANOVA). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study explored the dynamic spectral changes of the intrinsic functional connectivity of the large-scale sensori-motor brain network in KS patients and HC subjects, demonstrating that KS patients presenting at the clinical examination with the phenomenon of bimanual synkinesis (or MM) may also exhibit different spontaneous fluctuations of the spectral content of SMN component over a 20 min period of observation between two most recurrent oscillatory states. \n\nFirst, we extracted a common group ICA component for the SMN of the whole group of KS patients and HC subjects with the purpose of extracting the most general spatial pattern characterizing the whole-brain co-activation of the most functionally connected motor regions. Starting from the SMN group component, the subject-specific SMN time-courses of activity were submitted to a sliding-window spectral analysis and a cluster analysis of the spectral power identified two stable and recurrent dFC states: a low-frequency state (state 1) and a high-frequency state (state 2). \n\nMany previous studies have supported the notion that neural oscillations supporting the functional connectivity of the human brain can exhibit frequency-dependent properties, even within the small range of slow rs-fMRI signal fluctuations ( ). In general, relatively higher frequency neuronal oscillations (e.g., in the gamma band in the EEG signal) are restricted to a relatively smaller spatial scale, whereas long-range neuronal communications are supported by slower oscillations (e.g., in delta band of the EEG signal) ( ). Accordingly, a general theory for brain oscillations, regardless of the scale of spatio-temporal observation, would prescribe that the longer the range of functional connectivity (among remote brain regions), the lower the frequency of the functional connectivity signal emerging from the integration of brain functions, the physiological rationale being that remote regions with different functional specialization most likely oscillate at different frequencies ( ) and several rs-fMRI studies have shown how the strength of large-scale networks decreases when the frequency increases ( ;  ;  ). Particularly, in the context of large-scale brain functional networks, the functional processes supporting long-range connections among spatially distributed cortical regions normally operate in a lower frequency band compared to those supporting short-range connections within more spatially compact subcortical regions ( ). In line with this notion, we had previously observed how slow 5 fluctuations of rs-fMRI signals were more characteristic of a cortical-cortical static functional connectivity, whereas slow 4 and slow 3 were more characteristic of a cortical-subcortical static functional connectivity [see, e.g.,   and  ]. Here, for the first time, we were able to demonstrate that at least two distinct (i.e., stable and recurrent) dynamic functional connectivity states may co-exist in the dynamic functional connectivity of the SMN in terms of a different contribution of relatively lower- and higher-frequency oscillatory components. This would imply that (i) there are shorter windows of time (∼1.5 min) where the slower cortical-cortical oscillations would prevail in the SMN functional connectivity against the faster subcortical-cortical oscillations and that (ii) the SMN network would spontaneously (and randomly) fluctuate between such periods, the balance between the occurrences of these two states becoming an interesting new element for the neuroimaging assessment of the motor circuitry functional integrity. In the more specific context of the MM symptom, here we found that, not only the relative spectral change in the switching between these two states was in average significantly increased in the slow 3 band in KS patients with MM (compared to HC subjects and KS patients without MM), but also the number of such transitions was significantly reduced in those patients that therefore appear to persist in the high-frequency dFC state for much longer time than needed or expected. This demonstrates how MM can be seen as a clinical manifestation of a neural deficit in dynamic flexibility of the SMN. \n\nImportantly, the dynamic spectral analysis of the SMN did not show significant differences between KSMM− patients and controls, indicating that the dynamic spectral shifts observed in the motor circuit of KS MM+ patients may not (primarily) depend on the general KS condition itself or some specific (KS-related) hormone or treatment differences between KS patients and controls. In addition, the absence of regional spectral differences in subcortical ROIs (when taken in isolation from the SMN) may suggest that the dynamic functional changes primarily depend upon on long-range connectivity changes affecting the resting-state cortical activity. More specifically, following up our previous line of interpretation ( ), we could hypothesize that the spontaneous synchronization of cortical motor areas is abnormally attracted toward a high-frequency state due to an abnormal functioning of the cortical-subcortical loop that controls voluntary movements. On the other hand, the lack of difference between MM+ patients and healthy controls in the functional connectivity of basal ganglia and thalamus was at least unexpected as the role of the interhemispheric control in the case of unilateral movements is well-known. Thus, we cannot exclude that this null finding was due to the lack of statistical power implied by the small size of the MM + group (including only three patients with right unilateral MM and only one patient with left unilateral MM) and anyway future studies (involving a larger sample of MM+ patients) are needed to address the relation between the changes observed here in the SMN functional connectivity and the left-right coupling of the resting-state oscillations across cortical and subcortical homotopic regions. \n\nThe analysis of time-varying brain activity and connectivity using rs-fMRI has become an important topic of ongoing neuroscience discussions. Indeed, significant changes in the temporal dynamics of brain network connectivity (both in terms of configuration and synchronization) have been reported in different neurological diseases, thereby some researchers have hypothesized that this type of analysis might eventually provide some important biomarkers of disease [see, e.g.,   and  ]. \n\nA crucial point of this study is that KS is a genetic disease in which we can see some functional aspects of a neurological disease, including the presence of MMs, that have originally suggested an involvement of the cerebral motor circuit. However, in KS, structural data from previous neuroimaging studies have provided conflicting results [see, e.g.,  ,  ,  ;  , and  ]. For example, abnormal values of the magnetization transfer ratio at level of the pyramidal decussation were observed in KS patients independently of the presence of MM ( ), but diffusion tensor imaging studies did not reveal structural changes of the cortical-spinal tract in KS patients with or without MM ( ,  ). At the cortical level, KS patients with MM showed significant cortical thinning in small regions known to be involved in the voluntary hand motor control and bilateral volume decrease of the globus pallidum, compared with KS patients without MM, thus suggesting a complex readjustment of the motor circuitry associated with bimanual synkinesis ( ). Our results would thus confirm in a newly designed rs-fMRI study on new KS patients, the observations of a previous study ( ) based a static functional connectivity approach, in which the analysis also revealed a significant group by frequency interaction pointing to a frequency shift in the spectral content in KS patients. However, as the present study was purposefully designed to perform a dynamic functional connectivity analysis, we were here able to pinpoint a more finally detailed aspect of KSMM+ functional connectivity: namely that these patients tend to switch from a lower frequency state of brain connectivity to a higher frequency with significantly greater facility than healthy controls and KSMM− patients and consequently tend to spend more time in this high frequency state. \n\nAs mentioned above, a dFC approach similar to the one presented here has been previously employed in other psychiatric and neurological diseases, including Schizophrenia, Parkinson’s Disease, Alzheimer’s Disease, autism or Huntington disease. In these pathologies, k-means clustering procedures have usually shown transitions among more than two brain networks states and the changes between these transitions were mostly related to cognitive ( ;  ;  ) or motor ( ) impairments. On the other hand, most KS patients are cognitively intact and only a small percentage of them develop bimanual synkinesis, which therefore characterize a very rare condition. Consequently, the neural underpinnings of MM phenomenon remain unclear, albeit the dynamic point of view on the functional connectivity addressed here seems promising with respect to the need of better addressing this aspect of the pathology. Of course, larger-sample studies, possibly integrating dFC from other networks or regions remain needed to better elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of MM in KS and in other congenital or acquired conditions, as well as in neurodegenerative diseases. \n\nIn conclusion, we have performed, to our knowledge, the first dFC analysis of the SMN, determining two discrete frequency-specific oscillatory states, in KS patients with and without MM. Major limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of this study: First, the relatively low number of KSMM+ patients. We were able to enroll only seven subjects with MM and this number was too small to address the possible correlation between the extent of the mirror movement and the extent of the changes of the network dynamics. Thus, the precise connection of our findings to the mirror movements in KS remains unclear. Fortunately, even with such a low number, significant (albeit few) differences emerged, suggesting that, by increasing the number of the sample, it will be possible to gain more evidence about this phenomenon. Second, as KS is a disease that mostly affects males, it would be interesting to evaluate what happens to dFC with more female patients at disposal, given that only one was included in our KS sample. Third, little is known, and no data were available, about how the highlighted transient resting-state connectivity states would eventually affect the execution of a motor task. Thus, further work is needed, including the possibility to address this issue by administering motor tasks to the patients. Related to this, an important issue to address would be the choice of window sizes for the sliding-window dFC analysis.   reported that only an ideal window size should be able to estimate dFC variability (capturing the low frequency modes of interest in the rs-fMRI signal) and concurrently detect short-term task-related effects. In this study, functional dynamics were estimated using a validated fixed sliding-window of 150 volumes (about 100s), a measure considered more than reasonable for a 20-min scan, to robustly capture at least two state and the corresponding transition counts. Nonetheless, when attempting to address the influence of the state on the motor response, it is likely that a trade-off existed between the sensitivity for detecting potentially interesting transients in dFC and the signal-to-noise ratio of the task-related FC. Future work should thus evaluate changes across several window lengths that would be then combined in multi-scale approach, e.g., using wavelet transform ( ;  ). It remains, that the peculiar phenomenon of MM in KS seems to be a good pathological model to investigate spectrally selective variations in long resting-state fMRI sessions and further studies will possibly confirm or better explain the highlighted dynamics behind the pathogenic hypothesis of MM. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Ethics statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Ethical Committee at the University Hospital “San Giovanni Di Dio e Ruggi D’Aragona” of Salerno.

More is needed to understand the interplay of large-scale neural networks during fear extinction in these disorders. We used dynamic functional connectivity (FC) to study how FC might be perturbed during conditioned fear extinction in individuals with AX or PTSD. We analyzed neuroimaging data from 338 individuals that underwent a two-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. The sample included healthy controls (HC), trauma-exposed non-PTSD controls, and patients diagnosed with AX or PTSD. Dynamic FC during extinction learning gradually increased in the HC group but not in patient groups. The lack of FC change in patients was predominantly observed within and between the default mode, frontoparietal control, and somatomotor networks. The AX and PTSD groups showed impairments in different, yet partially overlapping connections especially involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Extinction-induced FC predicted ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation and FC during extinction memory recall only in the HC group. FC impairments during extinction learning correlated with fear- and anxiety-related clinical measures. These findings suggest that relative to controls, individuals with AX or PTSD exhibited widespread abnormal FC in higher-order cognitive and attention networks during extinction learning and failed to establish a link between neural signatures during extinction learning and memory retrieval. This failure might underlie abnormal processes related to the conscious awareness, attention allocation, and sensory processes during extinction learning and retrieval in fear- and anxiety-related disorders. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nConditioned fear inhibition is achieved by the repeated presentations of the conditioned stimulus in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus. This fear extinction process is critical for fear reduction in the aftermath of trauma exposure or when exposed to fear- and anxiety-inducing stimuli. Failure to appropriately extinguish fear could contribute to the maintenance of anxiety-related symptoms, which is thought to characterize posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders [ ,  ]. Pavlovian fear extinction is a widely used translational model for studying the mechanisms of fear extinction [ – ]. Rodent and human studies suggest that fear conditioning and extinction engage a network of brain regions including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), hippocampus, amygdala, and insular cortex [ ,  ]. This ‘fear network’ is extensively involved in threat-detection, regulating defensive reactions, and emotion processing [ ]. Impaired activations within the ‘fear network’ have been reported in various psychiatric disorders using fear-related paradigms as well as other emotion-provoking tasks [ – ]. LeDoux and Pine recently questioned the traditional view regarding the contribution of the ‘fear network’ to the subjective feeling of fear [ ]. That is, the so-called ‘fear network’ is mostly composed of brain regions essential for the detection and responding to threat. As such, higher-order cognition, attention, and sensory systems ought to be engaged and interact with the threat detection network to enable our conscious feeling of being afraid and anxious. \n\nMost human neuroimaging studies have yet to establish a connection between cognitive/attention networks and the subjective measures of fear and anxiety. Recent studies started to emerge in support of the LeDoux-Pine concept. For example, meta-analyses revealed the engagement of multiple cortical regions during the fear conditioning and extinction tasks [ ], but these activations have not been linked to any subjective measures of fear and anxiety. Activations across well-defined systems including the default mode and salience networks have been reported to be engaged during fear-related tasks [ ]. Using a population of healthy controls, we recently showed that dynamic functional connectivity (FC) across distributed brain regions, especially within the default mode and frontoparietal control networks, gradually increased as extinction learning progressed [ ]. These results support the idea that large-scale brain systems- involved in attention control, conscious awareness, and sensory motor function are engaged during threat extinction learning and fear regulation. Nonetheless, the relevance of these broad changes in FC to subjective anxiety and trauma related metrics have not been assessed in individuals with psychiatric disorders. \n\nIn this study, we examined the dynamic changes of large-scale FC across extinction learning in healthy individuals and in patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders or PTSD. We estimated whole-brain connectivity of participants during different timepoints of extinction learning, compared the FC change between groups, and evaluated the relevance of extinction-induced FC changes to various fear- and anxiety-related clinical metrics. Based on our previous study [ ], and given evidence in the literature showing deficient extinction learning and memory retrieval in patients with anxiety and PTSD [ ,  ,  ], we hypothesized that individuals with anxiety disorders or PTSD would show less FC increase than healthy controls during extinction learning that is specific to the conditioned stimuli. We also predicted that abnormal FC during extinction learning would be related to brain activations and FC during extinction memory recall, and would associate with symptom measures across all participants. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe analyzed data from a total of 338 individuals (see Supplementary Methods). Of those, 77 were healthy controls (HC), 91 were diagnosed with anxiety disorders (AX), 81 were diagnosed with PTSD, 89 were trauma-exposed non-PTSD controls (TENC) (Supplementary Table  ). Some results from these data have been published elsewhere with a different focus [ – ]; the current results are novel and have not been previously published. All procedures were approved by the Partners HealthCare Institute Review Board of the Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School. All participants provided written informed consent before they participated in the study. \n\n\n### Experimental procedure \n  \nParticipants underwent a validated 2-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm in the fMRI scanner [ ,  ]. Details of the paradigm and fMRI acquisition are provided in the Supplementary Methods. Briefly, participants completed the fear conditioning phase on day 1. During conditioning, they were presented with three cues (conditioned stimulus, CS), two of which were partially reinforced with a mild electric shock (CS + ) and the other was not reinforced (CS−). Fear conditioning was followed by an extinction learning phase, where one of the CS + and the CS− were repeatedly presented in the absence of shock. Twenty-four hours later (day 2) participants underwent an extinction memory test. During this phase, they were presented with all three cues: the extinguished CS + (CS + E), the unextinguished CS + (CS + U), and the CS−, to assess their extinction memory. \n\n\n### Dynamic functional connectivity \n  \nAs in our previous study [ ], we estimated the dynamic FC using a jackknife procedure, such that we could measure the relative difference in FC at a specific trial compared to other trials [ ]. We divided the whole-brain into 432 regions, including 400 cortical regions [ ] and 32 subcortical regions [ ]. We then combined the beta-series correlations method [ ] and the jackknife correlation method to estimate task-based FC [ ,  ], which resulted in a 432×432 symmetric matrix for each trial. We reordered FC matrices according to CS type (CS + and CS−) and presentation time (from the first to the last CS trial) during the experiment, evenly divided the trials of each CS type into 4 time-blocks (from time-block 1 to 4, representing early to late extinction learning) and averaged trials within each time-block. We thereafter obtained 4 FC matrices during CS + and 4 during CS− processing for each participant. See Supplementary Methods for additional details. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nWe previously reported that the FC gradually increased from early to late extinction learning in a HC population. This increase was specific to the CS+ and predicted the magnitude of extinction memory [ ]. Given that prior studies reported deficient extinction learning and memory retrieval in patients with anxiety and PTSD [ ,  ,  ], we hypothesized that the AX and PTSD groups would exhibit deficient FC increase during extinction learning. We specifically examined the FC change during CS + processing from early to late extinction (ΔFC, defined as FC in time-block 4 minus FC in time-block 1). For each connection/edge, we performed a two-sample   t  -test to compare ΔFC between the HC and AX groups or between the HC and PTSD groups, while controlling for age and sex as covariates. We used the Network-Based Statistic (NBS) procedure [ ]—a well-validated method for controlling family-wise error (FWE)—to identify network components that showed significant difference between groups. The primary component-forming threshold was set to   p   < 0.001, the significant components were identified with   p   < 0.05 using permutation tests (see Supplementary Methods for details). \n\nTo test if ΔFC during learning was relevant to the neural signature of extinction memory recall, we conducted cross-phase correlation analysis. In this multiple regression analysis, the independent variable was the mean ΔFC across the identified components, the dependent variable was the brain activation or FC in the extinction memory test (CS + E vs. CS + U, first 4 trials of each type). The age and sex data were included as covariates. Significant activations were identified at a voxel-level   p   < 0.001 and a cluster-level   p   < 0.05. Significant network components were identified using the NBS method (edge-level   p   < 0.001, component-level   p   < 0.05). \n\nTo investigate associations between ΔFC and symptom measures, we conducted canonical correlation analysis (CCA)—a multivariate statistical method that identifies correlations between two sets of variables [ ]. One set of variables was ΔFC of all edges across the identified abnormal network; the other set of variables was clinical measures from each participant. For HC and AX, clinical measures including the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait form (STAI-T). For TENC and PTSD, the clinical measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). We did not use the same clinical measures as in the HC and AX groups, since these measures were not collected in the TENC and PTSD groups. Nonparametric permutation tests (10000 times of shuffle) were employed to assess the statistical significance of the resulting canonical variables (see Supplementary Methods for details). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Abnormal dynamic FC during extinction learning \n  \nAs expected, we identified a network component showing widespread ΔFC differences in the AX group compared to the HC group (1369 edges,   p   < 0.001, Fig.  ). During CS + processing, the mean FC of the HC group gradually increased from early to late extinction learning, while the mean FC pattern of the AX group decreased at the end of extinction learning (Fig.  ). The identified component showed larger change of differential connectivity (difference between [CS+–CS−] at time-block 4 and [CS +–CS−] at time-block 1) in the HC than the AX group (  t   = 3.62,   p   < 0.001). The identified component did not show significant group differences during conditioning or extinction memory recall (see Supplementary Results, and Supplementary Fig.  ). We also constructed static FC—a single FC matrix for all CS+ trials. However, there was no significant statistical FC difference for HC vs. AX (CS + :   p   = 0.25), suggesting the importance of considering the extinction learning as a dynamic process.

AX   anxiety group,   HC   healthy controls,   PTSD   posttraumatic stress disorder. \n  \n\nWe subsequently investigated to which specific brain networks do the identified abnormal between-group connections belong. We assigned regions to one of 8 pre-identified canonical networks involved in cognitive, attention, control, and sensory processing [ ]. We calculated the proportion of significant edges among all edges within or between these networks. The abnormal edges in the AX group predominantly involved connections between the frontoparietal control (CON) and other networks, as well as between the dorsal/ventral attention (DAN/VAN) and somatomotor network (SMN), and these abnormalities were only observed during the processing of the CS+ and not the CS− (Fig.  ). \n\nWe conducted the same analyses discussed above for the PTSD group. We first examined the abnormal network identified in AX, found that the PTSD group also showed lower extinction-induced ΔFC than the HC in this network (  t   = −4.46,   p   < 0.001). We then compared the PTSD group to HC group using whole-brain NBS procedure, which revealed a significant component (590 edges,   p   = 0.007, Fig.  ). For the HC group, this component showed similar patterns to those identified in the HC vs. AX analyses, i.e., a gradual increase in FC from early to late extinction learning during CS + processing. In contrast, for the PTSD group, the mean FC pattern decreased across the extinction learning phase during the CS + processing, a pattern not observed during CS- processing (Fig.  ). The identified component showed larger change of differential connectivity in the HC than the PTSD group (  t   = 4.95,   p   < 0.001). The abnormal edges in the PTSD group were predominantly noted within and between the CON, DMN, DAN/VAN, and visual networks; all of which were specific to the CS + and not to the CS− (Fig.  ). \n\nWe next examined the extent of overlapping abnormalities in the ΔFC across the AX and PTSD groups. The intersection of the two identified components (HC vs. AX and HC vs. PTSD) was calculated. This analysis revealed 152 connections that were commonly impaired in the patient groups (Fig.  ), largely involving the CON, DMN, and SMN (Fig.  ). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) was one of the regions that formed the largest number of commonly impaired connections (Supplementary Fig.  ). Based on this result, we specifically examined which regions formed abnormal connections with the dlPFC in the two groups. Interestingly, the predominant impairments in the connections with the dlPFC across both groups were observed in regions composing the traditional “fear network”, including dACC, rostral ACC (rACC)/vmPFC and insula. One specific notable difference was that the PTSD group had an impaired dlPFC-hippocampus connection that was not observed in the AX group, whereas the AX group had an extensive dlPFC-thalamic impairment (Fig.  ).    Shared and distinct impaired edges of the AX and PTSD groups during extinction learning.  \n A   There were 152 edges that were impaired in both AX and PTSD groups.

Note substantial impairments in FC between dlPFC and key nodes of the ‘fear network’.   dACC   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex,   vmPFC   ventromedial prefrontal cortex,   rACC   rostral anterior cingulate cortex. \n  \n\n\n### Associations between extinction-induced FC and neural signals during extinction memory recall \n  \nNext, we examined whether ΔFC was associated with brain activation during extinction memory recall. For the network identified with HC vs. AX, the vmPFC was the only region that showed significant cross-phase correlation (Fig.  ). Specifically, the extinction-induced ΔFC (mean value of the identified component in Fig.  ) positively related with the vmPFC activation at recall in the HC group (peak MNI  = [−4,40,−8],   r   = 0.48,   p   < 0.001), but not in the AX group (  r   = 0.05,   p   = 0.45) or the PTSD group (  r   = −0.15,   p   = 0.20). Steiger’s Z test confirmed that the HC group showed significantly higher correlation than the other two groups (AX: Δ  r   = 0.43,   Z   = 2.93,   p   = 0.003; PTSD: Δ  r   = 0.63,   Z   = 4.07,   p   < 0.001). A significantly positive correlation between ΔFC and vmPFC activation was also observed in the HC group using the network identified with HC vs. PTSD (Supplementary Fig.  ).    Change in functional connectivity during extinction learning predicts brain activation during extinction memory recall.  \nThe correlation between extinction-induced connectivity change and vmPFC activation during memory recall is significant within the HC, but not within the AX or PTSD group. Red circles in the AX and PTSD highlight the absence of any correlations from the same vmPFC location observed to be correlated within the HC. Scatter plots show correlations between change in FC and beta weights extracted from the vmPFC for each of the three groups. \n  \n\nWe next examined the correlation between ΔFC and connectivity during extinction memory recall. For the HC group, there was a network component that exhibited positive cross-phase correlation (419 connections,   p   = 0.015, Fig.  ). The network implicated distributed connections between networks, especially between the SMN and DMN. In contrast, the AX group exhibited a negative correlation between ΔFC and FC (344 connections,   p   = 0.020, Fig.  ). The network mainly involved connections between the CON and other networks, especially the SMN and VAN.    Change in functional connectivity during extinction learning correlates with functional connectivity during memory recall test.  \n A   The FC change positively correlated with FC during extinction memory recall within the HC group.   B   The FC change negatively correlated with connectivity during memory recall within the AX group. \n  \n\n\n### Comparing PTSD with TENC \n  \nThe above analyses for the PTSD cohort involved a HC group as the control group. This enabled comparisons of the results between the AX and PTSD cohorts. Given that prior studies commonly use a trauma-exposed non-PTSD controls (TENC) group as a control group, we conducted additional FC analyses comparing the PTSD to TENC. These additional analyses mostly replicated the results of HC vs. PTSD analyses (see Supplementary Results for details); revealing a significant network component that mainly involved connections between the DMN with other networks (Supplementary Figs.   and  ). The TENC group showed increased FC while the PTSD showed decreased FC, from early to late extinction learning—changes that were only observed to the CS+. \n\n\n### ΔFC associations with clinical measures across all participants \n  \nCCA identified a significant canonical variate linking ΔFC to the clinical measures (i.e., ASI, STAI-T, BAI and BDI) in the HC and AX groups (  r   = 0.46, permutation test   p   = 0.007, Fig.  ). We further conducted a 5-fold cross-validation procedure, which repeatedly trained the CCA model on 80% of the data, tested the trained model on the remaining 20% data (see Supplementary Methods for details). This procedure resulted in a significant correlation between the predicted and observed measures (  r   = 0.40, permutation test   p   = 0.003), supporting the robustness of the identified canonical variate. We then calculated the canonical loadings to examine how the individual clinical measure and connectivity contributed to the canonical variate (Fig.  ). The analysis revealed that all 4 clinical measures negatively contributed to the clinical score, while extinction-induced ΔFC across the 8 networks positively correlated with the connectivity variate.    The canonical correlation analysis between connectivity change during extinction learning and clinical measures.  \n A   The correlation between connectivity variate and clinical variate is significant for the HC and AX cohort.   B   The canonical loadings of the clinical measures (top) and connectivity changes with each of the 8 subnetworks (bottom).   C  ,   D   Same as in panels   A   and   B  , but for the TENC and PTSD cohort. \n  \n\nSimilar results were observed in the TENC and PTSD groups. Specifically, there was a significant canonical variate linking ΔFC to the symptom measure (CAPS-5) in the TENC and PTSD groups (  r   = 0.40, permutation test   p   < 0.001, Fig.  ). The 5-fold cross-validation procedure further confirmed the identified link (  r   = 0.36, permutation test   p   < 0.001). The canonical loadings indicated that the symptom measure positively contributed to the clinical variate, while ΔFC negatively correlated with the connectivity variate (Fig.  ). Together, these results suggest that the lower magnitude of change in functional connectivity during extinction learning was associated with higher levels of fear- and anxiety-related clinical measures. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe studied the dynamic changes of large-scale FC across extinction learning in healthy controls (HC) and patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders (AX) or PTSD. From early to late extinction learning, HC exhibited an increase in FC that was specific to the conditioned cue. The AX and PTSD groups exhibited widespread FC impairments during extinction learning. The relative FC reductions in patient groups were predominantly in the interactions between the default mode network (DMN), frontoparietal control network (CON), somatomotor network (SMN), and attention networks (DAN/VAN). The extinction-induced FC changes were predictive of vmPFC activation during extinction recall only in the HC group. FC changes during extinction learning positively and negatively correlated with FC during recall in the HC and the AX groups, respectively. Finally, extinction-induced FC was associated with subjective measures of fear- and anxiety-related clinical metrics. \n\nAnimal literature shows that learning-induced plasticity can change both neural activity and neuronal synchronization [ ]. Neural activity change is presumably reflected in changes in regional activation, whereas neuronal synchronization between distributed regions may better be characterized by functional connectivity [ ]. Prior fMRI literature on fear conditioning and extinction has focused on localized brain activation. Abnormal activations during extinction learning and/or fear recall/renewal were reported in populations with anxiety disorders and PTSD, especially within the ‘fear network’ [ ,  – ]. Structural abnormalities beyond the ‘fear network’ were robustly observed in PTSD [ ]. In this study, we shifted our analytic strategy to pay more attention on the dynamic functional connectivity during the experiment. Our results extend prior studies by showing that interactions between brain regions extensively beyond the ‘fear network’ were altered in PTSD and AX groups during extinction learning. The observed cross-phase correlations are in line with animal studies showing that neural changes during learning are relevant to the retrieval [ ,  ]. We also examined the association between the change of connectivity and activation within the extinction learning. This analysis did not show significant association in the HC or PTSD group, but revealed significant negative correlation between connectivity and activation (especially in regions like insula and dACC) in the AX group (Supplementary Figure  ). These results suggest that the activation and connectivity contain distinct information, examining both activation and connectivity can provide complementary information for the understanding of pathophysiology [ ]. \n\nPrior fear extinction studies have focused predominantly on neural circuits associated with expression and inhibition of conditioned threat responses. The conscious awareness of fear, and the feeling of no longer being afraid, would require multiple cognitive processes, including perception, attention, conscious awareness, and memory construction. These multi-level processes are likely to require coordinated interactions between distributed brain regions [ ]. A recently proposed “two-system” framework view of fear suggests that higher-order association cortices would be needed to generate and regulate the feeling of fear [ ]. In support of this view, our recent study on HC showed the engagement of distributed brain regions during extinction learning [ ]. These brain regions were part of many networks including the DMN, CON, DAN/VAN and SMN. These networks are extensively involved in conscious awareness, attentional control, memory encoding, perception and motor control [ ,  ]. Furthermore, previous studies found that activations across multiple brain systems are engaged in fear-related processing [ ,  ]. Dysfunction within and between the DMN, CON, and SMN were extensively reported in resting-state and task-based fMRI studies investigating psychiatric disorders [ ,  ]. The abnormal FC across the above noted networks in patient groups suggests inadequate encoding and/or consolidating of information related to perception and conscious awareness of threat-inducing stimuli. These impairments in higher-order processing could thereafter lead to imbalance in the maintenance of fear and emotional homeostasis. \n\nThe distinct dysfunction in some networks and the partial overlap in some others across the AX and PTSD groups suggest both divergent and shared mechanistic impairments pertinent to fear inhibition across these psychopathologies. While there was an overlap in the FC dysfunction across multiple brain regions between the patient groups, the dlPFC—a region known for its contribution to cognitive control and regulation [ – ], appeared to be highly relevant. The dlPFC was activated when subjects were instructed to regulate their conditioned fear [ ,  ]. Importantly, transcranial magnetic stimulation-based neuromodulation targeting the dlPFC during [ ] or after [ ] extinction learning enhanced extinction memory recall in HC, demonstrating the important role of dlPFC during extinction learning. The dysfunctional connections between the dlPFC across the two patient groups were mostly associated with the dACC, insular cortex, and vmPFC. These brain regions are key nodes of the ‘fear network’, and have been shown to be dysfunctional across anxiety disorders and PTSD. A notable distinction is that dlPFC-hippocampus FC was impaired in the PTSD group only, whereas insular cortex-dlPFC dysfunction in FC was much more pronounced in the AX group. These data are consistent with the idea that anxiety disorders are more often associated with imbalance in the perception and regulation of internal states (mostly related to insular dysfunction) [ ], whereas PTSD is a disorder that is more often associated with failure to contextualize certain experiences associated with the trauma—a process that is heavily reliant on the hippocampus (see [ ,  ] for comprehensive review). \n\nWe observed a positive correlation between extinction-induced ΔFC (predominantly involved CON, DMN, DAN and SMN) and vmPFC activation during memory recall only in the HC group. The vmPFC plays a key role in inhibiting threat response [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Abnormal vmPFC activation during the retrieval of extinction memory was observed in individuals with PTSD or anxiety disorders [ ,  ,  ], which may relate to the deficits in extinction memory recall. The extinction-induced ΔFC was also differentially associated with FC during extinction memory test for the HC and patient groups. Specifically, ΔFC positively correlated with distributed connections in the HC group, while negatively correlated with a network component dominated by connections between CON and SMN in the AX group, suggesting that psychopathology impacts the encoding of extinction memory and thus leads to deficits in its retrieval. This inefficient encoding of extinction learning might be related to, or caused by, an initially higher degree of state or trait anxiety. This ‘higher load of emotionality’ would therefore interfere with the cognitive processes required to learn that a given cue is no longer predictive of danger. Indeed, we observed a significant association between extinction-induced FC change and subjective reports of anxiety symptoms (including ASI, STAI-T and BAI); the higher the anxiety and trauma-related symptoms (CAPS-5), the lower the magnitude of FC observed during extinction learning—especially connections with CON and VAN. These results provide support for the two-system concept proposed by LeDoux and Pine. That is, conscious feelings of fear and anxiety require higher-order brain processing; impairments of these systems lead to lesser cognitive attention and sensory processing of highly relevant information. Less cognitive processing then leads to imbalance in fear perception and its homeostasis. \n\nWe specifically focused our analyses on the connectivity during CS+ processing since our previous study on healthy controls showed that connectivity during CS+ processing increased from early to late extinction learning, and predicted the magnitude of extinction memory [ ]. The identified network components also showed significantly higher change of differential connectivity (CS + vs. CS−) from early to late extinction learning in the HC group than the AX/PTSD group, suggesting learning-induced plasticity that is specific to the conditioned cue. In addition to the analytic approach discussed above, we further conducted generalized psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) analysis [ ] to investigate the change of differential connectivity at whole-brain level. We identified abnormal change of differential connectivity in the AX (Supplementary Fig.  ) but not PTSD group. The lack of significant interaction difference for HC vs. PTSD, as discussed in previous study [ ], might be due to the overgeneralization of PTSD patients across cues (CS+ and CS−) [ ], which could undermine detection of differential effects. An alternative explanation to the negative finding in the PTSD cohort is that gPPI and beta-series correlation methods have relatively low sensitivity in detecting subtle difference between conditions [ ]. This is especially the case in event-related design with small number of trials, which may lower the power in detecting complex stimulus-by-group interactions. \n\nWe observed abnormal connections extensively involved CON and DMN in the PTSD group when comparing it with either the non-exposed controls or trauma-exposed controls. This result suggests that the connectivity alterations in the PTSD group are not merely a result of the traumatic exposure. There is evidence showing that traumatic exposure per se may alter activation and functional connectivity [ ,  ,  ]. Therefore, it is important for future studies to have three-group design (i.e., include both non-exposed, trauma-exposed controls, and PTSD) to further understand effects of trauma exposure and PTSD mechanisms (see [ ] for detailed discussion). In this study, the anxiety group was composed by subjects diagnosed with different types of anxiety disorders. The small sample size of each specific anxiety type prevented us from conducting a subgroup analysis to explore the contribution of each specific diagnosis to the detected abnormal functional connectivity. It would be interesting for future studies to investigate whether different anxiety disorders exhibit similar patterns of abnormal connectivity with a larger sample size from each anxiety type. \n\nThe dynamic nature of extinction learning-induced neural plasticity is overlooked to some degree in prior studies as many neuroimaging studies average functional brain activation across extinction learning. However, a few prior studies suggested the dynamic changes of activation during the fear conditioning and extinction paradigm in PTSD and healthy participants [ ,  ]. Specifically, activation patterns and case-control differences clearly differed when extinction and extinction recall phases were further divided into “early” and “late” stages. Our study extends these studies by directly examining the dynamic change of functional connectivity between groups with more refined temporal resolution. Together, these studies provide strong support to the idea that a critical focus on the dynamic nature of learning during an experiment is needed and essential. We demonstrated that individuals with fear- and anxiety-related disorders exhibited widespread impairment in connectivity patterns- captured when considering time (number of trials during learning)- compared with controls, particularly involving the default mode network, frontoparietal control network, and somatomotor network.

Dynamic functional connectivity is a novel tool with little application in affective disorders to date, and holds the potential to unravel fluctuations in connectivity strength over time in major depression. We assessed stability of connectivity in major depression between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), key nodes in the DMN that are implicated in ruminative cognitions. Functional connectivity stability between the mPFC and PCC over the course of a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan was compared between medication-free patients with major depression and healthy controls matched for age, sex and handedness. We tested replicability of the results in an independent sample using multi-echo resting-state fMRI. The primary sample included 20 patients and 19 controls, while the validation sample included 19 patients and 19 controls. Greater connectivity variability was detected in major depression between mPFC and PCC. This was demonstrated in both samples indicating that the results were reliable and were not influenced by the fMRI acquisition approach used. Our results demonstrate that alterations within the DMN in major depression go beyond changes in connectivity strength and extend to reduced connectivity stability within key DMN regions. Findings were robustly replicated across two independent samples. Further research is necessary to better understand the nature of these fluctuations in connectivity and their relationship to the aetiology of major depression. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDepression is a common illness with substantial negative consequences for sufferers and society.  A better insight into neurobiological changes contributing to symptom generation is a research priority to improve diagnosis and treatment. \n\nNeuroimaging has enhanced our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying depressive symptoms  by identifying potential alterations in the structural and functional brain networks.  The default mode network (DMN) is one system that has attracted great research interest in major depression. One reason for this relates to its importance in the generation of self-referential thoughts, negative rumination and depressive symptoms.  A recent meta-analysis of static connectivity studies in major depression demonstrated hyperconnectivity within the DMN and between the DMN and fronto-parietal systems.  Within the DMN, the subsystem connecting the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is considered pivotal in generating affective, self-directed judgements and thoughts.  Although heightened static functional connectivity has been shown in major depression within this subsystem in association with a ruminative cognitive style,  there is uncertainty about its functional temporal stability. Connectivity variability is a plausible mechanism in major depression to explain brain responses associated with cognitive demands and processing of emotions. \n\nThere is, however, little dynamic functional connectivity research published to date  with only one study in major depression.  This study showed increased variability in connectivity within the DMN between the mPFC and the insula, which correlated with a ruminative thinking style and coexisted with decreased variability between the mPFC and the parahippocampal gyrus.  No effect was found between the mPFC and PCC in this study, despite these being crucial in the generation of self-directed negative affective cognitions, potentially due to the less powerful whole-brain analysis method used. \n\nHence, we specifically evaluated temporal connectivity variability between the mPFC and the PCC, a subsystem within the DMN, given its relevance to ruminative cognitions associated with depression.  Kaiser   et al.   observed increased connectivity variability between the mPFC and insula, part of the ‘salience network' that is known to influence synergistically this DMN subsystem when processing internally generated salient information,  correlating with levels of rumination. Based on this finding that connections related to rumination show increased variability, we hypothesized increased connectivity variability in major depression between the mPFC and the PCC, correlating with ruminative cognitions. We tested this hypothesis first in a primary sample of medication-free participants with major depression selected to be free from psychiatric comorbidity. We then validated the robustness of this result by replicating the findings in an independent clinical sample. As a further test of the stability of the results in the presence of significant clinical heterogeneity, the validation sample included patients with major depression and comorbid anxiety disorders. Furthermore, the robustness of the neuroimaging results to non-neural artefacts was ensured by utilizing multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a recent development that is superior to traditional de-noising methods. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe right-handed participants aged 18–65 were recruited from the local community using online advertisements  and waiting lists of local psychological therapy services. Given the novelty of the method, we were unable to determine an expected effect size   a priori  . However, the sample size was chosen to be consistent with other studies in the area and we used a validation sample to ensure our results were robust. All patients met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders IV criteria for unipolar major depression (current or recurrent episode), as determined by clinical interview based on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview.  In the primary sample, comorbid conditions were excluded. For the validation sample, comorbid anxiety disorders were allowed alongside major depression. Depression severity was assessed with the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale  and a score ⩾18 was required for inclusion. Raters for both samples were trained on an independent sample of patients and demonstrated high inter-rater reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficient=0.96,   P  =0.004). The severity of anxiety symptoms was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 anxiety/somatization factor items (anxiety subscale)  and handedness with the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.  Trait rumination was assessed using the Rumination Response Scale (RRS),  a 22-item self-report measure. Patients were not receiving any form of treatment, psychological or pharmacological, at the time of scanning and were medication-free for ⩾2 weeks (⩾4 weeks for fluoxetine) before MRI scanning. No subjects had been receiving treatment with medication requiring a longer washout period. Healthy controls were assessed to exclude personal and familial (first-degree relatives) psychiatric history. Exclusion criteria for all the subjects included history of head injury, illicit substance use in the preceding two months, unstable medical illness, any treatment with potential psychotropic properties or interference with participants' safety or data interpretation, pregnancy or other contraindications for scanning. \n\n\n### Ethics approval \n  \nThe research was approved by the local ethics committee. The subjects provided written informed consent and were compensated financially for participating. \n\n\n### fMRI acquisition \n  \nThe data for each sample were acquired on two identical GE MR750 3-Tesla scanners with 12-channel radiofrequency head coils. The participants fixated on a cross with their eyes open for the scan duration. For the primary sample, a 6-min resting-state scan using a T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging sequence was acquired (repetition time=2000, echo time=30 ms, field of view=22.1 cm, flip angle=75°, 39 slices, resolution=3.3 mm ). The cardiac signals and respiratory information were also recorded. For the validation sample, the data were acquired using an 8-min multi-echo sequence (repetition time=2300 ms, echo time=12.7/31/48 ms, field of view=24 cm, flip angle=90°, 33 slices, resolution=3.75 × 3.75 × 4.2 mm). An identical high-resolution T1-weighted structural image was acquired for both the samples. \n\n\n### fMRI preprocessing \n  \nThe data were pre-processed with custom Nipype ( ) scripts, using tools from SPM12 ( ), FSL 5.0.9 ( ), AFNI ( ), along with custom code (available upon request). The first four volumes of the functional series were discarded to allow for equilibration effects. Slice timing correction was performed and the images were realigned and co-registered to the structural image using the normalized mutual information method in SPM12. For the primary sample, physiological signals (cardiac and respiratory) were regressed from the data using AFNI's RETROICOR  tool. For the validation sample, multi-echo data were pre-processed using the multi-echo independent component analysis tool in AFNI  to isolate components in the signal representing true blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. This was used in place of RETROICOR as it has been shown to be a more effective method of de-noising.  The remaining processing steps were identical for both samples for consistency. Six motion parameters (three translation, three rotation, determined from the middle echo image for the validation sample) plus time series extracted from the white matter and cerebrospinal fluid regions were regressed out of the data. Data were then temporally filtered from 0.008 to 0.09 Hz before being demeaned, de-trended and smoothed with a 6 mm full width at half maximum kernel. Thus, preprocessing for both samples was identical except for the method of de-noising used. \n\n\n### Motion scrubbing \n  \nAs even minimal head motion can affect correlations calculated from resting-state data when not controlled for,  time points exhibiting excessive motion were scrubbed from the BOLD time series.  Motion at each time point was assessed using root mean square (RMS) intensity difference between volumes (REFRMS) and DVARS  as calculated using the FSL motion outliers tool with default thresholds. As directly removing time points would affect the length of the sliding window, and hence dynamic connectivity estimates, we instead interpolated time points showing substantial motion using third-order b-spline interpolation. To compare motion estimates between samples, we used both total distance travelled and framewise displacement.  All the analyses were performed on the scrubbed, pre-processed data. \n\n\n### Region of interest definition \n  \nWe performed group canonical independent component analysis,  implemented in Nilearn and using 20 clusters, to identify the DMN components. The clusters centred on the posterior cingulate and mPFC regions in the DMN component were used to create regions of interest (ROIs) for the connectivity variability analysis. A 10 mm diameter sphere was created based on the peak of each cluster in the independent component analysis, and mean time series were extracted from each of these ROIs. This procedure was performed independently for the two samples to identify sample-specific ROIs. These ROIs were used in place of the entire cluster to provide a more consistent signal and avoid contamination from surrounding areas. To ensure that results were specific to these regions rather than being a global pattern, or caused by non-neural factors, we performed a negative control analysis between these regions and a 10 mm spherical ROI in the medial primary motor cortex (Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates=−1, −8, 63), a region not previously linked to depression. \n\n\n### Sliding window correlation analysis \n  \nThe sliding window analysis was performed using custom Python ( ) scripts. The data were split into 40 s Gaussian moving windows, staggered by one repetition time, created using a Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 8 s (see   for a detailed discussion of the sliding window methodology). This time period has been shown to be appropriate for characterizing dynamic functional connectivity  and provides a fine-grained picture of temporal changes in connectivity. For each window, correlations were computed between variance-normalized time series from the two regions using Pearson correlations, the results of which were then transformed to   Z  -scores. The variability of these correlations was calculated as their standard deviation, and subjects with outlying correlation variability values (±3 standard deviations from the mean) were removed. We also calculated the static functional connectivity strength between these regions using the entire, non-windowed time series to understand the relationship between static and dynamic functional connectivity. Further statistical analyses were performed using R.  All the group comparisons and correlations were adjusted for age, sex and head motion (total distance travelled), and were corrected for the number of comparisons (mPFC–PCC and two negative controls) using false discovery rate correction. \n\nWe assessed relationships between functional connectivity variability and clinical measures including depression and anxiety severity scores, time since illness onset and RRS in Pearson partial correlations. \n\n\n### Voxel-based morphometry \n  \nWe also compared grey matter volumes in the chosen ROIs between patients and controls using voxel-based morphometry to examine the co-existence of volumetric changes that may explain changes in connectivity. High-resolution T1-weighted structural images (repetition time=7.31 ms, time to echo=3.02 ms, 256 × 256 matrix, 196 slices, voxel size=1.2 × 1.05 × 1.05 mm, for both the samples) were pre-processed using voxel-based morphometry in SPM12 ( ) for both the samples. Images were segmented into different tissue types and processed with DARTEL  before being normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute space. The modulated grey matter images were then smoothed with an 8 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. Grey matter volume was next compared between groups within the same mPFC and PCC regions of interest used in the functional connectivity analysis with a two-sample   t  -test. A cluster-defining voxelwise threshold of   P  <0.001 uncorrected was used, with a clusterwise threshold of 0.05 false discovery rate corrected. Total grey matter volume was also calculated based on the segmented maps created in SPM (thresholded at grey matter volume probability >0.5) and compared between the groups. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty patients with unipolar major depression in the primary study and 19 in the validation study were sex and age matched with 19 healthy controls in the primary sample and 20 in the validation sample ( ). Three and nine subjects were recruited through psychological therapy services in the primary and validation samples, respectively, while the remaining participants were recruited from the community. A healthy participant from the validation sample was removed from the analyses due to outlying connectivity variability values.   shows coordinates for the selected ROIs. \n\n\n### Connectivity variability in major depression \n  \nConnectivity variability, expressed as the standard deviation of connectivity strength between the mPFC and the PCC ( ), was significantly greater in patients with major depression versus healthy controls (  t  (37)=2.56,   P  =0.044,   d  =0.82). This effect was successfully replicated in the validation sample (  t  (36)=2.53,   P  =0.045,   d  =0.82) supporting the coherence of the model in identifying consistently greater connectivity variability across samples irrespective of clinical heterogeneity. \n\nThere were no group differences in connectivity variability in either sample between the mPFC and primary motor cortex, chosen as a negative control region (primary sample:   t  (37)=0.79,   P  =0.44, validation sample:   t  (36)=1.85,   P  =0.22), or between the PCC and primary motor cortex (primary sample:   t  (37)=1.76,   P  =0.17, validation sample: PCC:   t  (36)=0.63,   P  =0.99), suggesting that results did not reflect global instability. No differences in static connectivity strength between mPFC and PCC were found between patients and controls in either sample (primary sample:   t  (37)=0.33,   P  =0.74,   d  =0.11, validation sample:   t  (36)=0.73,   P  =0.47,   d  =0.24). \n\n\n### Connectivity variability and cognitive style \n  \nA positive correlation of RRS with connectivity variability was noted in the validation sample (  r  (14)=0.51,   P  =0.045,  ), and not the primary sample (  r  (15)=0.18,   P  =0.48). The relationship did not remain significant in a pooled analysis with both groups combined and sample as a covariate (  r  (34)=0.30,   P  =0.075). We did not find significant correlations between RRS scores and static connectivity strength in either sample (primary sample:   r  (15)=0.31,   P  =0.22, validation sample:   r  (14)=−0.13,   P  =0.62). \n\n\n### Correlations with clinical variables \n  \nCorrelations between connectivity variability and depressive symptom severity were not significant (primary sample:   r  (15)=0.37,   P  =0.14, validation sample:   r  (14)=0.23,   P  =0.40). The same pattern of results was observed between correlation variability and anxiety symptoms scores, as measured by the anxiety subscale of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (sample A:   r  (15)=0.11,   P  =0.66, sample B:   r  (14)=-0.23,   P  =0.39). The time since illness onset was not significantly correlated with connectivity variability in either sample (sample A:   r  (15)=0.25,   P  =0.33, sample B:   r  (14)=0.16,   P  =0.55). \n\n\n### Grey matter volumes \n  \nThere were no differences between groups in grey matter volume in the chosen regions of interest (no significant clusters at   P  <0.001, false discovery rate corrected). There were also no differences in the total grey matter volume between groups (primary sample:   t  (37)=1.43,   P  =0.16, validation sample:   t  (36)=0.79,   P  =0.43). \n\n\n### Head motion \n  \nThere were no significant differences in the total distance travelled between the patients and controls in the primary sample (  t  (37)=−1.31,   P  =0.20) or the validation sample (  t  (36)=0.56,   P  =0.58). When looking at framewise motion measures, there were no significant differences between the groups in mean framewise displacement (primary sample:   t  (37)=0.88,   P  =0.38, validation sample:   t  (36)=0.26,   P  =0.80) or maximum displacement (primary sample:   t  (37)=0.42,   P  =0.68, validation sample:   t  (36)=1.48,   P  =0.15). There was also no significant difference between groups in the number of interpolated time points (primary sample:   U  (37)=173,   P  =0.64, non-parametric test used due to non-normally distributed data, validation sample:   t  (36)=1.60,   P  =0.12), or in the thresholds used for detecting outlying time points for either the primary sample (REFRMS:   t  (37)=−0.14,   P  =0.89, DVARS:   t  (37)=0.42,   P  =0.68) or the validation sample (REFRMS:   t  (36)=0.67,   P  =0.51, DVARS:   t  (36)=0.71,   P  =0.48). \n\nThere were also no significant correlations in the validation sample between rumination scores and total distance travelled (  R  (17)=0.13,   P  =0.59), mean displacement (  R  (17)=-0.09,   P  =0.70), maximum displacement (  R  (17)=0.17,   P  =0.48), or the number of interpolated time points (  R  (17)=0.11,   P  =0.66), indicating that the observed relationship between connectivity variability cannot be explained by motion. There were no significant relationships between thresholds used to detect outlying time points and rumination scores (REFRMS   R  (17)=0.11,   P  =0.65, DVARS:   R  (17)=0.35,   P  =0.15). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe compared variability in connectivity strength within the DMN between medication-free individuals with major depression and matched healthy controls. We found that connectivity between the mPFC and PCC, two key nodes in the DMN, was significantly more variable in currently symptomatic patients with major depression. Furthermore, the validity of the results was confirmed in an independent sample of individuals with significantly more clinical heterogeneity, and using multi-echo acquisition parameters to limit the impact of non-neural signals. We believe this is the first time that greater connectivity variability has been reported in major depression in this DMN subsystem, complementing findings of reported abnormal dynamic connectivity in other brain regions in major depression  and other psychiatric conditions. \n\nIn agreement with Kaiser   et al.  ,  we demonstrated that the increased variability in neural connectivity originating from the mPFC correlates with a ruminative thinking pattern, indicating a possible synergy of this DMN subsystem with the ‘salience network' represented by the insula.  This previous study, a whole-brain analysis, demonstrated altered connectivity variability between the mPFC and other DMN regions, but not specifically the PCC,  and variability in connectivity between the mPFC and parahippocampal gyrus was reduced. This might be explained by the more limited power in whole-brain analyses due to the necessary correction for multiple comparisons. Another possible explanation is that depression is associated with increased connectivity variability in the central DMN (including the PCC), while variability in the ventral system (including the parahippocampal gyrus) is reduced. \n\nAt present, the biological significance of time varying properties of connectivity is not well understood.  One potential explanation for the observed greater connectivity variability is that it results from reduced structural connectivity in the DMN as suggested by previous research linking structural integrity with connectivity variability.  However, our recent meta-analysis reported that structural integrity is maintained in the tracts connecting these regions in major depression,  suggesting that such an explanation is unlikely, further supported by our finding of no alteration in grey matter volume in the ROIs in these patient samples. It is also possible that greater connectivity variability reflects primary alterations in neuronal communication rather than occurring secondary to aberrant structural connectivity, a suggestion that is in line with preclinical work showing primary abnormalities of neural processing in circuits relevant to depression.  Clarifying the precise meaning of connectivity variability, and how it relates to connectivity strength, at a neural level will be an important task for future research. \n\nWe also tested the hypothesis that a ruminative cognitive style, linked with depression,  potentially explains the observed abnormalities in connectivity variability between mPFC and PCC. We observed a direct positive correlation between levels of intrusive, self-generated, ruminative thoughts and variability in connectivity within this network. This was, however, present only in the validation sample. This discrepancy in the results can be explained by issues related to statistical power combined with variability in the samples clinical characteristics. Patients in the validation sample were in fact characterized by higher rumination scores and comorbid anxiety disorders. It is possible that this result is reflective of a stronger link between anxiety symptoms and rumination,  and further work could clarify this. The difference between samples may also be related to differences in image acquisition and preprocessing. It is also possible that connectivity variability might be more closely linked to ‘state' rumination levels occurring at the time of scanning rather than more ingrained ‘trait' measures such as the RRS or to state anxiety, which we did not assess here. This is supported by work adopting post-scan cognitive style reports in healthy volunteers.  This study suggested a positive correlation between variability in the DMN and reported daydreaming (a related phenomenon to rumination) during MRI scanning, consistent with our findings. \n\nWe found no association in either sample between variability and depression severity scores. This may suggest that increased variability is not directly related to depressive symptoms. However, it is possible that this could be due to the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, our measure of symptom severity, being weighted towards somatic rather than cognitive symptoms of depression. Previous research suggests that alterations in DMN connectivity are more likely to be related to psychological symptoms such as negative self-related cognitions.  Another possible explanation is that the relationship between biological disease mechanisms and symptoms is complex, and tend not to correlate linearly with one another. \n\nWe found no alterations in static connectivity strength in both our samples in agreement with some studies  but not others.  Discrepancies in the findings can be explained by methodological differences in connectivity measurements, the proneness of neuroimaging data to type I/II error based on their relatively moderate sample sizes as indicated by recent meta-analyses  and multiple sources of heterogeneity intrinsic to major depressive disorders. We adopted a cross-validation method applied for the first time to this type of data to help enhance robustness of the findings. Based on our experience, future studies could consider a similar approach with larger samples, perhaps in the context of collaborative mega-analyses  to reduce statistical bias and increase power. \n\nIn addition to this potential link between connectivity instability and alterations in cognitive or emotional state, such as rumination, instability may also reflect increased noise or alterations in neural dynamics. Simulation studies have indicated that patterns of synchronization and desynchronization in neuronal populations lead to fluctuations in functional connectivity as measured using fMRI,  while noise-driven neuronal simulations produce switches between states of functional connectivity.  Notably, simultaneous electroencephalography and fMRI have shown that changes in the BOLD functional connectivity mirror electroencephalography power fluctuations  further indicating that variations in the functional connectivity are reflective of neuronal processes. It is possible that fluctuations in connectivity may reflect underlying changes in neural synchrony, a key process in inter-regional communication, which has been proposed to be affected in a range of psychiatric disorders. \n\nIt has previously been suggested that hyperconnectivity implies lower variability in connectivity.  However, this is at odds with our results as we did not find group differences in static connectivity. Hence, the relationship between dynamic and static connectivity appears complex, with dynamic functional connectivity providing distinct information about network communication in a state of pathology independent from and beyond that of static connectivity. This echoes findings from previous research that attempted to classify patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and healthy controls based on functional connectivity, indicating that classification using a combination of static and dynamic connectivity tends to be more accurate than static connectivity alone. \n\nA notable strength of this study is the control of non-neural influences on the data. The resting-state fMRI analyses are susceptible to influence from confounding factors such as motion and physiological variables,  and this is especially pertinent here in view of the possibility that physiological characteristics such as heart rate may differ between groups due to increased anxiety in patient groups. Consequently, we rigorously controlled for these in a number of ways, including correction for cardiac and respiratory signals, and motion scrubbing.  In our replication sample we used multi-echo fMRI with independent component analysis-based de-noising, which is more effective than traditional de-noising methods,  providing further evidence that our original results were not a result of non-neural influences. Moreover, our negative control analyses indicate that our findings were specific to the disease-relevant network under investigation, and groups did not differ on motion parameters. \n\nFurther strengths of the present study are the inclusion of medication-free patients, suggesting that the findings are not due to pharmacological effects. In addition, many patients in the primary sample were medication-naive and had experienced few, if any, past depressive episodes, making it less likely that the effects observed are cumulative effects of illness or previous treatment. The demonstration of greater connectivity variability in the validation sample, which included patients with more chronic and heterogeneous illness and used multi-echo fMRI, increases confidence in the reliability of the findings, which are unlikely to be attributable to idiosyncrasies of a specific sample or methodological artefacts. This is particularly important in view of concerns regarding poor reproducibility in research.  Replication is an important step towards minimizing false associations and enhancing reliability of results,  and the reproducibility demonstrated here suggests that alterations in dynamic functional connectivity are robust. Future replications of these results are warranted, and it would be of particular interest to examine connectivity variability in non-symptomatic individuals with depression and ‘at risk' samples to test whether it is a feature of the depressive state, a marker of vulnerability to depression or a ‘scar' effect. \n\nOne limitation of this study is the focus on two isolated regions of the DMN. We chose these regions given their key role in the DMN, and association with rumination in major depression.  Focusing on   a priori   regions of interest nevertheless increased the power to detect changes given the relatively small sample sizes. Additional analyses to confirm the replicability of previous findings, such as altered dynamic connectivity with the insula, would have been of interest; however, we chose to focus on one particular component of the DMN to reduce the likelihood of type II errors due correction for multiple comparisons with a small sample. \n\nFurthermore, alternative methods to sliding window analyses, such as coherence-based methods, have been proposed that may provide more accurate estimations of dynamic functional connectivity.  Given their novelty, we have however chosen to use a more established method that has been evaluated in numerous studies. It is also possible that using different window lengths may affect the analysis. We believe the 40 s windows used here is an optimal length for detecting alterations in dynamic functional connectivity (see   for further discussion of this issue). In addition, our imaging sequences were only 6 and 8 min long for the primary and replication sample respectively. This may have limited our ability to detect less-frequent fluctuations in connectivity. Furthermore, our replication data and analysis differed slightly from our primary sample in acquisition and de-noising methods, making this more of a conceptual than methodological replication. Nevertheless, the fact that our results were largely consistent despite these dissimilarities suggests that the effect is robust. \n\nIn view of the presence of a range of anxiety disorders in the validation sample, it is not possible to determine whether altered connectivity variability might be a common abnormality present in both major depression and anxiety disorders rather than being specifically associated with depression. High comorbidity rates between anxiety and depressive disorders and the co-occurrence of anxiety symptoms in major depression are frequent findings in clinical practice.  This makes the differentiation challenging to establish. Lastly, it should be noted that the sample sizes used here were relatively small. Nonetheless, the consistency of our results across two independent samples indicates that our results are unlikely to be spurious. \n\nIn conclusion, our study indicates that major depression is associated with reduced stability of connectivity within the DMN in key regions relevant to the generation of ruminative cognitions. This could represent an intrinsic neural property of this illness and a potential network-specific brain abnormality not previously explained by structural abnormalities or static functional connectivity. The results were replicated in a second independent sample, indicating that they are robust. Ruminative cognitive style might partially explain the results in keeping with cognitive models of depressive disorders. This work adds to functional connectivity research in affective disorders by validating new findings across different samples with novel fMRI analysis techniques. Further work investigating trait markers of vulnerability to depression and connectivity variability in remitted patients are necessary to establish the specificity of these findings to the depressed state. Similarly, longitudinal studies are required to explore the effect of treatment on these abnormalities. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"8b6712d51af39e13243cb31f0c62752b"},

Functional connectivity can represent static and dynamic relations, but often these are modeled using a fixed choice for the data window Alternatively, deep learning models may flexibly learn various representations from the same data based on the model architecture and the training task. However, the representations produced by deep learning models are often difficult to interpret and require additional posthoc methods, e.g., saliency maps. In this work, we integrate the strengths of deep learning and functional connectivity methods while also mitigating their weaknesses. With interpretability in mind, we present a deep learning architecture that exposes a directed graph layer that represents what the model has learned about relevant brain connectivity. A surprising benefit of this architectural interpretability is significantly improved accuracy in discriminating controls and patients with schizophrenia, autism, and dementia, as well as age and gender prediction from functional MRI data. We also resolve the window size selection problem for dynamic directed connectivity estimation as we estimate windowing functions from the data, capturing what is needed to estimate the graph at each time-point. We demonstrate efficacy of our method in comparison with multiple existing models that focus on classification accuracy, unlike our interpretability-focused architecture. Using the same data but training different models on their own discriminative tasks we are able to estimate task-specific directed connectivity matrices for each subject. Results show that the proposed approach is also more robust to confounding factors compared to standard dynamic functional connectivity models. The dynamic patterns captured by our model are naturally interpretable since they highlight the intervals in the signal that are most important for the prediction. The proposed approach reveals that differences in connectivity among sensorimotor networks relative to default-mode networks are an important indicator of dementia and gender. Dysconnectivity between networks, specially sensorimotor and visual, is linked with schizophrenic patients, however schizophrenic patients show increased intra-network default-mode connectivity compared to healthy controls. Sensorimotor connectivity was important for both dementia and schizophrenia prediction, but schizophrenia is more related to dysconnectivity between networks whereas, dementia bio-markers were mostly intra-network connectivity. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFunctional connectivity has emerged as a promising tool for understanding the brain’s functional architecture and has been widely used ( ;  ;  ; Van Den Heuvel and Pol, 2010a). Disruptions in the brain’s functional connectivity are often linked to brain disorders evident in patients’ behavior (van den Heuvel and Pol, 2010b). For example, schizophrenic patients have high level of functional dysconnectivity between brain networks ( ;  ;  ;  ; van den Heuvel et al., 2010;  ;  ;  ) and exhibit dysregulated dynamic connectivity across multiple brain networks ( ). Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is also known to disrupt brain dynamics leading to wide-spread cognitive dysfunction ( ). \n\nThe association of brain disorders with abnormal static or dynamic functional connectivity highlights the need to develop models that can identify disorder-specific connectivity aberrations. This observation guides development of various approaches to brain connectivity analysis ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However in most existing approaches, the functional connectivity matrices are not informed by the prediction task but instead estimated prior to training; thus, they depend entirely on the chosen input window of data samples. The independence from the downstream task results in inflexible estimation of connectivity matrices as the estimate is unchanged regardless of whether the task is to predict a brain disorder, age, or other quantity.   proposed a method where the functional connectivity structure is computed based on the learned representations of the data, but even this method lacks a learnable connectivity estimation method. We argue that task-dependent connectivity matrices can be estimated by a deep learning (DL) model using learnable weights. DL models are flexible in their ability to learn a variety of representations from the same data based on the architecture and ground-truth signal used in training. \n\nHowever, using a DL method to estimate a connectivity matrix can be challenging without the presence of the ground-truth graph during training. Another problem of many DL models is lack of consistency and interpretability in the learned representations. Saliency maps commonly used to address interpretability of these models ( ;  ;  ;  ) may be difficult to interpret ( ). Arguably, the difficulty of interpreting representations is the reason why studies using DL models incorporate inflexible but interpretable feature selection steps for connectivity estimation, for example Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) ( ). \n\nIn most of the current studies, functional connectivity estimates are either static or dynamically computed using a sliding window approach dependent on the window size and stride ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Unable to capture non-stationarity, static matrices miss essential information about dynamics. For example, dynamic functional connectivity estimates show re-occurring patterns which cannot be captured by their static counterparts ( ;  ;  ). Using a static graph learning method to capture a dynamical system may reduce classification performance ( ).   show improved results by just dynamically re-evaluating the learned static graph during testing. The improved performance for the relevant task is understandable as the dynamic connectivity provides essential information about the system, for instance, capturing re-occurring patterns. The brain’s functional activity is also perceived to be highly dynamic and hence cannot be faithfully captured with a static or even window-based approach ( ). \n\nFurthermore, studies using functional connectivity to measure connectivity between brain regions or networks do not capture the direction of interaction and only measure undirected statistical dependence such as correlations, coherence, or transfer entropy. Correlation can arise for many reasons; for example, due to a common cause when an unobserved network affects two networks that are observed ( ;  ). Arguably, dynamics of interaction among brain networks is beyond simple correlations and correlation may only partially describe it. Whereas, effective connectivity is a more general way to represent dynamic and directed relationships among brain’s intrinsic networks. As introduced by   effective connectivity falls into a model-based class of methods while multiple other methods, including those in the model-free class have been since developed ( ;  ; Chickering, 2002a; 2002b;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nLike these approaches, to estimate brain networks’ connectivity that is 1) directed, 2) interpretable, 3) flexible, and 4) dynamic, we have developed an approach called the Directed Instantaneous Connectivity Estimator (DICE): a predictive model to estimate dynamic directed connectivity between brain networks, represented as a dynamically varying directed graph by predicting the downstream binary label. Our model may be placed into the category of model-free connectivity methods as it does not model the data generation process. We defer to using “directed (network) connectivity” (D(N)C) for the graphs that DICE estimates. \n\nUnlike existing supervised DL models that typically produce difficult-to-interpret representations, we designed our model primarily with interpretability in mind. Our model reveals what it learned about the dynamics of brain network connectivity without using post hoc interpretability methods. Effectively, we have built a “glass-box” layer within a traditionally “black-box” DL model. In contrast to commonly used hidden layers, the “glass-box” layer propagates a weighted adjacency matrix of a directed graph, ensuring that it is interpretable in the context of the classification task. Hence, by estimating DC based on the task and using only the estimated connectivity structure for classification, our model learns to capture task-relevant networks and their connectivity, leading to a flexible estimation of an interpretable DC. By estimating DC instantaneously (window-size = 1), DICE removes the need for the window-size parameter used in many dynamic connectivity studies. \n\nTo thoroughly validate DICE’s performance, we conduct a series of experiments on four neuroimaging datasets that span three disorders (schizophrenia, autism, and dementia) and cover a wide age range. We train the model on classification tasks for each of these brain disorders, age prediction, and gender classification, and analyze the resulting DC of the “glass-box” layer. Surprisingly, our deliberate focus on stable interpretable results has an enhancing side effect on DICE’s predictive performance. As we show, the model’s predictions are better or on par with state-of-the-art methods that were developed with a focus on classification performance rather than interpretability. We show that when learning to classify subjects based on a specific criterion, DICE estimates interpretable DCs specific to that criterion. For gender and mental disorder classification, subgraphs emphasized by the learned DCs are discriminative of gender and mental disorders, respectively. We also demonstrate that DICE learns interpretable DCs distinct to dementia, gender, and age prediction for the same subjects by enhancing connectivity for networks that pertain to the training signal. Our flexible estimation of DC structures advances the results of  , which show that functional parcel boundaries change for an individual based on the cognitive state. We show an increased utility of the inferred directionality for increasing the precision of explainable group differences. As a result, DICE can resolve more states in fMRI dynamics than is resolvable in typical dynamic functional network connectivity analyses. Additionally, DICE incorporates a temporal attention module that highlights crucial time steps relevant to the task, further improving the interpretation of predictions for the dynamics. The learned DC structures and temporal attention weights are stable and consistent across randomly-seeded trials. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Materials \n  \nWe use resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data as input to our model. fMRI measures blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which captures the functional activity of the brain over time. We test our model by classifying three different brain disorders, predict gender and age of subjects. For each brain disorder we perform binary classification of healthy controls (HC) and patients. Four datasets used in this study are collected from FBIRN (Function Biomedical Informatics Research Network )   project, from release 1.0 of ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange )   and from release 3.0 of OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies )  . Healthy controls from the HCP (Human Connectome Project) ( ) are used for gender prediction. Refer to   for details of the datasets. \n\n#### Preprocessing \n  \nWe use two typical brain parcellation techniques; independent component analysis (ICA) and regions of interest (ROIs) based on a predefined atlas. The preprocessing pipeline used depends on the parcellation technique and the pipeline used in state-of-the-art studies for the dataset. All the preprocessing was done before training the model. \n\n##### ICA parcellation: \n  \nFor all experiments conducted using ICA as brain parcellation technique the fMRI data was preprocessed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM12,  ) under the MATLAB 2021 environment. A rigid body motion correction was performed to correct subject head motion, followed by the slice-timing correction to account for timing difference in slice acquisition. The fMRI data were subsequently warped into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using an echo planar imaging (EPI) template and were slightly resampled to 3 × 3 × 3 mm  isotropic voxels. The resampled fMRI images were then smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) = 6 mm. \n\nWe selected subjects for further analysis ( ) if the subjects have head motion ≤ 3° and ≤ 3 mm, and with functional data providing near full brain successful normalization ( ). 100 ICA components are estimated using a novel fully automated Neuromark pipeline “neuromark_fmri_1.0”  described in  . This method is capable of capturing robust imaging features that are comparable across subjects, datasets, and studies, which is beneficial for those studies need replication. The Neuromark framework leverages an adaptive-ICA technique that automates the estimation of comparable brain markers across subjects, datasets, and studies. A set of component templates were used as references to guide the estimation of single-scan components for the data. These component templates were created via a unified ICA pipeline. They were constructed using an independent resting-state fMRI data with large samples of healthy subjects from the genomics superstruct project (GSP). The GSP data include 1005 subjects’ scans that passed the data QC. High model order (order = 100) group ICA was performed on the GSP data, and then the independent components (ICs) from the GSP data were used as the references to extract components for each dataset used for experiment in this study. The Neuromark framework extracts the components for each subject respectively, which means that the estimation of features of each subject is not influenced by the others. However, the choice of components (and number of components) can influence accuracy, but our study is not focusing on determining the best number of ICs rather use the available components and let the model decide the task-dependant components. \n\n\n##### Region parcellation: \n  \nState-of-the-art methods use different preprocessing pipelines for different datasets. For comparison with these methods on HCP, ABIDE, and FBIRN datasets, we select the same preprocessing pipelines as in the relevant comparing method. We use the HCP ( ) data which was first minimally pre-processed following the pipeline described in  . The preprocessing includes gradient distortion correction, motion correction, and field map preprocessing, followed by registration to T1 weighted image. The registered EPI image was then normalized to the standard MNI152 space. To reduce noise from the data, FIX-ICA based denoising was applied ( ;  ). To minimize the effects of head motion subject scans with framewise displacement (FD) over 0.3mm at any time of the scan were discarded. The FD was computed with fsl motion outliers function of the FSL ( ). There were 152 discarded scans from filtering out with the FD, and 942 scans were left. For all experiments, the scans from the first run of HCP subjects released under S1200 were used. ABIDE ( ) was pre-processed using C-PAC ( ). The preprocessing includes; slice time correction, motion correction, skull striping, global mean intensity normalization, nuisance signal regression, band pass filtering, and finally functional images were registered to anatomical space (MNI12). After preprocessing using C-PAC, 871 out of 1112 subjects were chosen based on the visual quality, inspected by three human experts which looked for brain coverage, high movement peaks and other artifacts resulted by scanner ( ;  ;  ). To pre-process FBIRN data, SPM12 pipeline was used as explained in previous section with few extra steps. After the smoothing using a Gaussian kernel, the functional images were temporally filtered by a finite impulse response (FIR) bandpass filter (0.01 Hz-0.15 Hz). Then for each voxel, six rigid body head motion parameters, white matter (WM) signals, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signals were regressed out using linear regression. \n\nWe used two atlases for brain parcellation;  , and Harvard Oxford (HO) ( ) with 200, and 111 regions respectively. For each region, average value is computed for all the voxels falling inside a region, thus resulting into a single time-series for each region. After dividing data into regions, each time-series was standardized by their zscore having zero mean and unit variance. \n\n\n\n\n### Method \n  \nOur DICE model recieves the time-courses of the ICA components or ROIs represented as a matrix of size   N   *   T   (Number of components/ROIs * Number of time-points) and learns a set of   T   directed graphs representing the dynamic DC or DNC between spatial components (e.g., ICA-based spatial components, regions from an atlas), which we designate as nodes of a graph by predicting the binary labels. Let   G   represent the set of graphs where   G   = {  g  ,   g  , …   , g  } where   T   is the total time-points and   g   = (  V  ,   E  ), where,   V   and   E   represent the nodes and edges present at time-point   t  . To create the graph   g   we first use a bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) ( ) module to create the embedding   of node   i   at time   t  . We then use a self-attention module ( ) which takes all such embeddings at each time   t   and create a weight matrix among nodes thus providing the DC (graph) between nodes at each time-point. To create a final graph   G   for downstream classification, we use a temporal attention model that assign a weight to each   g   and compute the weighted sum of the set   G  . We explain the working and purpose of each module in detail in the following sections.   shows the complete architecture. \n\n#### biLSTM \n  \nThe time-point value   for node   i   at time   t   can be effected by many different factors and relations. Capturing these relations can increase model interpretability and improve downstream classification performance. In a time-series (fMRI data), one of these factors is the values/data at previous time-points  . In fMRI data, this relationship is unknown and is hard to capture and hence cannot be computed using a fixed method/formula (hand-crafted features). The difficulty is further increased by a) low temporal resolution of fMRI data and b) the fact that it is unknown how farther in time the effects of a time-point remains in a time-series. These effects are different for each subject and can even vary among nodes of the same subject. LSTMs have proved to be extremely effective for time-series/sequence data where the model takes an input from a sequence at time-point   t   and create representation for current and also predict representation for future time-courses based on the representation of previous time-points. LSTMs learn the temporal relationships between data through the cell’s memory and forget gate. These gates are optimized on the data and downstream task (ground-truth signal) and the relationships between data are learned instead of computed. The working of the LSTMs can be explained by the following set of equations.   σ   represents sigmoid activation, and ⊙ is the Hadamard product ( ). \n\nIn the above equations,   i  ,   f  , and   o   represent the input, forget and output gates at time   t   respectively.   c   represents the cell state (memory),   g   represents candidate for the cell state, and   h   represents the representation/embedding for the input at   t  .   W   and   W   represent the weights for the input and hidden vectors for the respective gate   x   ∈ {  i  -input  , f  -forget  , o  -output}. Similarly   b  ,   b   are the biases for the respective gate   x   ∈ {  i, f, o  }. We use a biLSTM to create representation   h   for each node   i  . Thus  ,   and  . Here   and   are representation for forward and backward pass. We use LSTM for each node (component/region) individually, sharing weights of LSTM among the nodes. As shown in  , LSTM’s usually take a vector   x   as input at each step, however, we give   (scalar value) as input to the LSTM along with hidden vector and receive   for the node   i   at time-point   t  , which solves the window size problem occurring in dynamic-FNC studies. To make it easier to understand, one can assume that in our model the window size is 1. This allows us to later instantaneously compute connectivity matrix (links/edges) between the nodes at each time-point. The biLSTM receives temporal values of each component/region separately but share the weight matrices across regions. This allows the biLSTM to learn the temporal connections by looking at multiple nodes but does not learn spatial dependencies among nodes. For this exact reason we use self-attention across nodes. \n\n\n#### Self-Attention \n  \nA node in a graph can be linked with other nodes represented as the edge connectivity between them. The connectivity between nodes influence the value of a node   at a certain time-point. Thus it is important to measure the connectivity between nodes for the construction and interpretation of the graph. In our fMRI data where each   x   is a brain region/component, capturing the DC or DNC between nodes shows how brain networks are linked with each other and the direction of flow of information between brain networks. The estimated matrices can then be used to explain brain working and brain disorders. Connectivity between brain regions is independent of the structural connectivity and thus is unknown. To capture the directed connectivity between brain regions, we use a self-attention module. \n\nSelf-attention module captures the weights between   n   inputs of a sequence. Since in a dynamic system (brain network), the connectivity between nodes can change at any instance, therefore, at each time-point   t   we pass a sequence of   n   vectors  ,   n   = total nodes, as input to the self-attention module and create the weight matrix   W  , where each   is the connectivity weight matrix of input nodes at time-point   t  . \n\nThe self-attention module creates three embeddings, namely, key (  k  ), value (  v  ), and query (  q  ) and creates new embeddings for each input using these embeddings. The following set of equations can sum up the whole process. For simplicity, we omit the   t   from these equations.   represents transpose and ⊕ represents concatenation. \n\nHere   is the connectivity matrix between   n   nodes in the graph. As brain disorder are associated with disruptions in the connectivity of brain’s intrinsic network, we only use our learned directed connectivity matrices   W   for downstream classification and not the features, thus forcing the model to estimate the differences in connectivity between the two classification groups (e.g., HC and patients). As DICE is tuned to estimate the DC or DNC for the groups of subjects and output the it, DICE captures and shows the basis of downstream classification. The DC or DNC estimated by the model can be easily represented as a graph which are extremely easy to interpret. The self-attention glass-box layer shows task-dependant nodes (brain regions) and their connectivity. \n\nThe features that represent time-courses are used to learn/estimate the DC or DNC structure. As the true connectivity/graph structure is never available in many applications to directly compare with, we propose that a connectivity matrix leading to state-of-the-art classification performance makes it more reliable than using the representations/embeddings for classification. \n\n\n#### Temporal attention \n  \nAs we use only the connectivity matrices learned by the model for downstream classification. For this purpose, we need to create a single weight matrix   W   based on the   W   matrices. For the downstream classification task, not all the time-points are equally important, hence it is crucial to incorporate a temporal attention module which assigns weight to each   W   and calculate a weighted average of all the weight matrices. We introduce a novel temporal attention module which we call global temporal attention (GTA). \n\n##### GTA: \n  \nTo give the attention module a global view of the graph, we present GTA. The global view allows the model to learn how each DC contributes to the global graph or structure of the data in the downstream task. We create an average of all the   T   DC and call it   W   representing the global view. We then compare the similarity of each local   W   with the global view and use them to create the temporal attention vector    α   .   shows the architecture details. \n\nHere ⊙ is the Hadamard product ( ) between matrices.   W   is computed as:\n \n\n\n\n\n### Training \n  \nWe used GTX 2080 with PyTorch as ML framework for our experiments. The hidden dimensions for the biLSTM was set to 100, whereas, self-attention including key, query, and value modules, were all set to 48. The dimensions of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers for calculating temporal attention vector were   η   *   len  (  flat  (  W  )),   η   *   len  (  flat  (  W  )), and 1 with   η   =   η   = 0.05. We noticed in our experiments that multiple heads of self-attention increases stability of the estimated DC. We used batch normalization after the first MLP layer. ReLU activation was used in our model between the MLP layers. A final two-layer MLP was used to get logits for binary classification problem with   W   as input with dimensions 64 and 2. We used cross-entropy loss with Adam optimizer. Let   θ   represent the parameters of the entire architecture,   being the predictions and   y   the true labels, the loss is calculated as:\n \n\nWe also experimented with additional loss terms to encourage the model to estimate connectivity matrices where the values of the main diagonal are closer to 1. Please refer to   for details. We used L1-regularization to get a sparser solution.   λ   (regularization weight) was set as 1  e   and learning rate was 2  e  . Based on the experiment, we reduced the learning rate either when validation loss reached plateau by a factor of 0.5 or exponentially with   γ   = 0.99. Early stopping was used to stop training the model based on validation loss and patience of 25. For each dataset (ICA components or ROIs), to have a fair result, we perform n-fold testing where the value of n depended on the dataset and methods we compared against. For each test fold we performed experiments with 10 randomly-seeded trials. We report the mean AUC-ROC (Area Under Curve - Receiver Operating Characteristic) across the n test folds and the 10 randomly-seeded trials as it is a more reliable metric than simple accuracy for binary classification tasks. For example, for FBIRN data we had 18 test folds and for each fold we performed 10 trials, which gives us a list of 180 AUC-ROC values and we report the average of these values. In some cases we also report other metrics as well, such as accuracy. Due to the size of the data, we made some hyper-parameter changes for HCP region-based (ROIs) experiments. The hidden dimension size for bilstm and self-attention module was set to 64 and 32.   η   was set to 0.005. Furthermore, because of memory constraints encountered during HCP region experiments, during both training and testing we divide the total time-points (1200) into a set of three, each having 400 time-points. We create logits for all and compute the mean to get final logits. Batch size was set to 32. \n\n#### Hyper-parameters selection and fine-tuning \n  \nAll the parameters (hidden dimensions, number of layers,   η  ,   η  ,   λ  , learning rate,   γ  , patience, batch size) mentioned in   were set as hyper-parameters. We fine-tuned these hyper-parameters based on the average performance of the model on validation dataset across all the folds. We did not perform hyper-parameters tuning based on the test folds and we report only test-set results. We also want to note here that we permuted the order of subjects for each dataset and performed the experiments using the permuted order. This was done to avoid imbalance of subjects in the folds. On the same lines, when dividing the data into n-folds (test folds) we tried to balance the number of subjects of both classes in each fold. For example, in case of FBIRN data with 311 subjects and 151 and 160 subjects in class 0 and 1 respectively. When performing 18 fold testing, each test fold consisted of   subjects from class 0 and   subjects from class 1 and the rest of the data was used for training and validation, where we kept the validation set size same as the test set size. The validation set was used for hyper-parameters tuning, early stopping during training and selecting the model to apply on the test data. We made sure that no subject (or sessions of a subject) repeated across training, validation and test sets. The exact size of training, validation and test set can be calculated using the criteria mentioned above and the total number of subjects and number of folds mentioned in  . In some of the experiments keeping the same number of subjects in each fold created a small data leakage at the end. For the results reported, the maximum leakage was for FBIRN dataset with 18 test folds. For this purpose, we performed another experiment on FBIRN dataset where the last fold had all the left out subjects to prevent any data leakage. This had no effect on the performance of the model. Refer to Table A.11 for results. \n\n\n\n\n## Experiments \n  \nTo test if DICE accomplishes all the goals, we perform detailed experiments by classifying three brain disorders, classify male and female groups for HCP and OASIS subjects, and predict age for OASIS subjects. We perform experiments for all datasets using ICA time-courses and perform experiments on FBIRN, ABIDE and HCP data using regions-based (ROIs) data as well. In this paper we refer to matrices capturing functional connectivity between networks at a whole-brain level as functional network connectivity (FNC) (Allen et al., 2011b;  ) and when operating on ROIs – as FC. We report the average results for all the trials. Depending on the experiment, we compare our classification results with state-of-the-art DL methods ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ; Zhang et al., 2018a) and ML methods (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR)). To avoid any discrepancy we report the results of the DL methods directly from the published studies, even though some studies use test data instead of validation data for selecting the best performing model/parameters. For ML methods we used the python package Polyssifier  which selects the best model/parameters based on the performance on validation data. \n\nTo show the efficacy of our model, we divide our results into three broad categories. In the following sections we show a) classification performance of our model, b) learned DC and DNC and c) the effects of temporal attention module. \n\n### Classification \n  \n shows the classification performance of our model using ICA data,   shows the performance using region-based (ROIs) data of FBIRN and HCP, and   shows results on ABIDE region-based (ROIs) data. \n\nOur model beats every state-of-the-art method used for comparison in this study in almost every metric for both ICA and region-based (ROIs) fMRI data across all datasets when using similar input data (fMRI). As our model does not use phenotypic information about subjects, it lacks behind ( ;  ) on ABIDE.   reports a decrease of ~ 2.5 AUC by using a different phenotypic information which clearly shows the dependence on phenotypic data. Whereas,   reports much lower AUC score by using only fMRI data. ML methods fail completely even on ICA data, We attribute this failure to two reasons. 1) The number of dimensions (  m  ) being much higher than the number of subjects (  n  ), thus creating the curse of dimensionality (  m   >>   n  ) and 2) The ML methods do not compute a graph structure for estimating the connectivity between the networks/components and instead mostly work with independent networks/components. According to our knowledge, no other model gives such high classification score across four neuroimaging datasets. The high classification score of the model computed using only the learned DC structure increases the confidence in the correctness of the learned DC structures. \n\n\n### Directed connectivity \n  \nThe learned interpretable, task-dependent (flexible) directed connectivity structures by our model is the most important contribution of our work. As this is a novel work, we show in detail, different aspects of the learned connectivity structures. We a) compare our learned DNC with FNC computed via PCC, b) compare the differences in DC and DNC between multiple classification groups, c) show how direction matters in connectivity, something which is not captured by FC and FNC, d) dive into the fact mentioned in introduction that unlike computed FNC (using PCC) our learned DNC is task dependent and changes based on the downstream task (ground-truth signal) and e) show the dynamic connectivity states for FBIRN data for HC and schizophrenia (SZ) subjects. All the aspects (a-e) discussed in detail in following sections show the correctness and interpretability of the learned DC and DNC. The interpretability of the connectivity matrices estimated by our model give insight into how brain networks are linked with each other and with the downstream classification task. This is very crucial to understand brain disorders and relevant brain networks. Unlike typical FC and FNC which ranges from −1 to 1, our learned matrices are based on attention and hence ranges from 0 to 1. More information on this in  . \n\n#### DNC vs FNC \n  \nAs the true connectivity between brain networks is not known, we compare our learned DNC with FNC.   shows the DNC learned by our model and the FNC computed using PCC using ICA components for FBIRN dataset. The DNC is   W   explained in  . Both DNC and FNC is the mean matrix for highest performing fold of FBIRN dataset with 16 subjects. The 100 ICA components are divided into informative (53) and noise (47). We show the connectvity between 53 non-noise components. These components are further divided into 7 domains/networks following (Allen et al., 2011a). Both matrices clearly show high intra-domain connectivity. The learned DNC shows similar pattern of FNC which increases the confidence in the DNC learned by our model but there are very important differences between the two.   Inter-network connectivity:   We see that our estimated DNC finds much more inter-network connectivities than the FNC which is mostly intra-network and has very low scores between networks.   Directionality:   Regarding the direct influence, DNC estimated by our model is directed and shows components in visual affecting components through out the domains, such information is not present in the FNC which is un-directed (symmetric across main diagonal) and does not show the direction of connectivity. Refer to   for more detail on this. \n\nTo compare the connectivity matrices in terms of classification results, we use an LR model and perform classification by first training and testing the model using PCC-based FNC and then by our estimated DNC as input. Refer to   for comparison. \n\n\n#### Directed connectome \n  \nCapturing directed connectivity is one of the methods to understand the direction and flow of information in the brain. Learning the direction of connectivity is one of the main advantages of our model as it might explain the direct influence of brain networks upon each other. To show the direction between components, we divide the DNC of FBIRN subjects into two connectomes showing the direction.   left shows the edges from   a   to   b   where   a   >   b  . For example the edge between (8,23) shows the edge from 23 to 8, whereas,   right shows the opposite. It is clear from the figure that direction matters and the connectivity between brain regions is beyond simple statistical dependence. For example,   shows that the components in visual network (VIN) affect components in other networks and the edges in the opposite direction are relatively much fewer. We also see direction of connectivity from cognitive control (CC) to sensorimotor (SM). Existing studies ( ;  ;  ) show that cognitive control is responsible for activities like attention, remembering and execution, things which are required when doing a motor task controlled by sensorimotor. Such directionality is important to study brain’s working in more detail and is not present in FNC used by existing methods. The results are further discussed in  \n\n\n#### Connectivity differences among groups \n  \nAs hypothesized that brain disorders are linked with the connectivity of brain’s intrinsic networks, we show how the learned DC and DNC changes for subjects belonging to different groups.   shows the DNC estimated by our model of HC and SZ subjects for FBIRN data whereas   shows DNC of male and female groups for OASIS dataset. Both results are computed using ICA pre-processed data. For ICA based DNC, there are similarity between the two matrices as they come from the same joint ICA. However, there are visible difference between the two for multiple networks like visual (VI), cognitive control (CC), default-mode (DM) and cerebellum (CB). The biggest difference between HC and SZ groups seems to be in the connectivity strength for VIN. For OASIS results   we see that females show high connectivity scores in default-mode network (DMN) compare to males and low sensori-motor network (SMN) connectivity compare to males, this has been verified by existing studies ( ;  ;  ;  ). To verify this by numbers, we use statistical testing to compare the two groups (male, female) and compare average connectivity for male and female in DMN and SMN.   shows the statistical results. \n\n performs the same experiment for region-based (ROIs) data. Here the regions for both sides of the brain (left and right) are divided into 7 domains following shaefer ( ). Again, in   for HC we see high connectivity score between regions of the same network. We also see connectivity between regions of same network across left and right side of the brain. The diagonals on top and bottom of the main diagonal shows this. Whereas the DC of SZ subjects is weakly connected compared to HC and is mostly shows intra-network connectivity. The sparsity explains and support the existing literature explaining SZ as functional dysconnectivity between brain networks ( ;  ;  ; van den Heuvel et al., 2010;  ;  ;  ). \n\n compares male and female groups based on region-based (ROIs) HCP data. We see similar patterns of hyper-connectivity of DMN and hypo-connectivity of SMN in females as compared to males. As the region-based (ROIs) parcellation divides the brain into left and right, we also see that females have high intra-network connectivity between left and right side of the brain as compared to males. \n\nTo verify the visual results, we use statistical testing to compare the DMN and SMN between males and females. The stats confirm the visual results with 1) female DMN showing higher connectivity than female SMN and male DMN, and 2) male SMN showing higher connectivity than male DMN and female SMN. We also see that the networks are highly statistically different. Refer to  . \n\n\n#### Task dependent DNC \n  \nHuman brain can be divided into multiple parts/regions where each region is linked with a set of tasks. For example, the hippocampus is associated with memory. Thus it is important to know which region/network(s) are linked with the downstream task (e.g. disorder classification). Finding the linked regions/networks would help us understand the disorder and allow to study the association of these regions/network(s) with the disorder in more detail. In this section, we see how the DNC structure learned by our model changes and identifies different networks for the same subjects based on the downstream task. For this purpose, we perform an experiment, where we compare the estimated DNC for OASIS data when predicting dementia, age and gender of the same subjects. The number of subjects were balanced with both HC and patients equalling 50% of the total subjects but had ~ 62% female subjects.   shows that our model produces task dependent DNC and the networks/domains showing high connectivity for each task adheres to the existing literature. The   shows the DNC learned when classifying subjects for dementia. We see high connectivity for components in the SM, DM, and CB networks. These networks are linked with dementia in existing literature, which support the results of our method. Whereas when classifying gender of same subjects, the estimated DNC is different and show high connectivity for components in DM and reduced connectivity for SMN.   shows the FNC computed via PCC for the same subjects. As FNC computed using PCC is only data dependent, the FNC would remain same for all the tasks and shows the inflexibility of the method.   therefore shows a) our model learns task dependent DNC and b) our model accurately finds networks linked with the downstream classification task. We see this as a significant advantage over studies which compute a fixed/static FNC using PCC and hence is independent of the downstream task. We see that   which is the learned connectivity structure when predicting age does not show high connectivity between networks and the connectivity values for SMN and DMN are almost same. This could be a reason of small age variance in the dataset. \n\nWe use statistical scores to verify the visual results.   shows the statistical difference between the three DCs as a whole and between DMN and SMN. We also compare the estimated DCs with FC  . \n\nWe see that all three DNCs are extremely statistically different. It is also proven that DMN is given higher connectivity scores for gender prediction whereas, SMN connectivity is much higher when predicting dementia comparing to gender and age prediction tasks. To clear how the connectivity values change for DMN and SMN we point out the average connectivity scores of the networks for dementia and gender classification and compare it with the values of DMN and SMN computed via PCC. The connectivity values in FC for SMN and DMN are 0.580 and 0.487 respectively (and would remain same irrespective of the classification task). Whereas, when classifying dementia our model show much higher SMN average value of 0.64 and a little decreased value of 0.478 for DMN showing a focus on SMN despite having more female subjects in the test set. When predicting gender for the same subjects the DNC estimated by our model has a decreased SMN value of 0.555 and increased value of 0.527 for DMN hence focusing less on SMN and more on DMN when compared to the dementia classifying task thus verifying that our estimated DCs are task-dependent and not only data dependent. We discuss the meaning and significance of this result in  . \n\nTo see the matrices as graph of nodes (regions) and edges (connectivity), we plot   and   on the brain and show the results in  . The figure shows high number of nodes and edges among components of VIN and SMN and among the two networks for dementia classification  , and high number of nodes and edges among components in DMN for gender classification  . \n\n\n#### Dynamic connectivity states \n  \nStudies like ( ;  ;  ;  ) show that human’s brain FC is dynamic and can be used to find patterns which are not visible in static FC studies. These studies show that dynamic FC show re-occuring patterns. To study these patterns, dynamic connectivity of the human brain is divided into distinct   k   states ( ;  ;  ). There are multiple methods proposed to find the   k   states with k-means being one of the most used methods. These studies show that the transition and time spent in each state is different for patients (SZ, dementia, autism) and HC. To validate our results and to find such patterns we use k-means to find   k   (5) such states using the DCs estimated by DICE for FBIRN dataset. We calculate and compare the time spent by both groups (SZ and HC) per state. \n\n shows that SZ subjects spend more time in weakly connected states (1,3) than HC which stay in states which show high connectivity score for visual (VI) and sensorimotor (SM). We also see that HC tend to change state more often than SZ which spend ~ 66% time in one state (number 3). Existing studies (Miller and Calhoun, 2020a; 2020b;  ) show that window-less approach can find dynamic patterns that are not captured by the vastly used window-based approach. As DICE is an instantaneous model, we investigate if DICE can capture more dynamic states than the window-based dynamic-FNC studies. For this purpose, using elbow method ( ), we found that the best   k   for the estimated DCs is not 5, and set   k   = 10 and show the resultant states in  . We see the model captures additional states that were not visible with   k   = 5. The additional states found show the pattern of directionality, specially in the states where HC spend more time than SZ. For example, in  , state 2 show dense connectivity for components in VIN and the direction is from VI to other states, and state 5 show similar direction but with sparse connectivity.   captures the additional state (9) which shows the opposite direction, that is, VIN has mostly incoming edges. We believe this state represents the brain activity when different networks (e.g. SMN) are giving input to VIN to control the vision. We discuss this result in  . \n\n\n\n### Temporal attention \n  \nOur temporal attention module finds the important time-points that are relevant for the downstream task (e.g. gender prediction). As not all time-points are equally important for the downstream task, and fMRI data has low temporal resolution, the temporal attention is an effective way of finding important bio-markers for neuroimaging dataset. Finding the relevant time-points can help reduce the data and allow to focus on activities at specific points.   shows the weights assigned to the subjects of FBIRN. \n\nWe show weights for 16 subjects (8 per class) with 10 randomly-seeded trials. The results show that the temporal attention module is very stable and assign similar weights to the time-points for every trial. \n\nTo further check the correctness of the time-points selected by our model and how these time-points are useful in terms of classification performance, we perform an experiment where after training the model, we use   W   of the top 5% values to train an LR model and then use the top 5% time-points of the test data to test the model. Similarly we perform experiments for bottom 5% values as well.   shows the comparison for the three brain disorder dataset. The results show that the LR model provides high AUC score by just using 5% of the important time-points. Thus, it proves that a) not all time-points are important for classification of the downstream task and b) our model accurately finds the important time-points. We use an LR model for this experiment to show that the learned top and bottom 5% values are not limited to our DICE model but is generalized such that an independent LR module gives high classification performance using the top 5% data identified by our model and does not learn on the low 5% data. Finally, our experiments also show that not using the temporal attention reduces the model classification performance by upto 10% A.12. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur experiments revealed a number of interesting properties of DICE and uncovered some interpretable directed connectivity graphs that we feel are of high utility for the neuroimaging field. As supported by results, models with glass-box layer like DICE have a high potential for studying resting-state dynamics of the brain. In the following, we discuss the most pertinent results. \n\n### Inter-network and directed connectivity \n  \nResults in   and   show that DICE infers DNC that agrees with the essential findings of the FC studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and provides two additional aspects: inter-network connectivity and direction of connectivity. The inter-network connectivity is of great significance as the brain is not made up of isolated networks and many tasks require information passing and neurons firing through multiple networks. Thus making it crucial to find how these networks are connected to each other if connected at all for patients and controls. Capturing the dysconnectivity between networks for patients can lead to knowledge discovery about the functionality of the human brain and the effects of brain disorders on it. Furthermore, finding directionality between networks is also of great significance. We showed in experiments that our model captures the direction of connectivity between networks. The direction of connectivity from VI to other networks, and from CC to SM networks is justifiable. Existing studies ( ;  ;  ) show that cognitive control is responsible for functions like attention, remembering, and execution. These functions are often required when doing a motor task controlled by sensorimotor, which hints at the direct effect of the CC network on the SM network, captured by DICE. Regarding VI and other networks, we know that VI is mostly a means of input (visuals) to our brain, which is then processed by different parts of the brain. Thus, most of the flow of information is from VI to other networks and few in the opposite direction, which is required to control VI for accomplishing different motor tasks controlled by SM. Therefore, our experiments also show that most incoming connections to VI are through the SM network, thus accurately capturing the flow of information between networks. This flow of information is not captured in simple correlations. We believe these two aspects are crucial to understanding brain working and are currently missed in connectivity estimation methods such as FNC. \n\nDirected connectivity directed influence of an intrinsic brain network on other networks. Estimating the direction of connectivity may simplify targeted interventions that are instrumental in establishing causal relations. Capturing causality between networks further helps to understand complex systems and answer counter-factual questions ( ), and is left to future work. Our model finds non-negative relations between components/nodes, which we consider dependencies or relevance rather than correlations. However, we understand that the negative correlations in FC and FNC are also helpful and provide descriptive information. We think it might be an easy fix to incorporate negative relations in connectivity matrices estimated by DICE. We discuss this in  . \n\n\n### Interpretability \n  \n shows how the DC and DNC estimated by DICE are interpretable in how accurately they capture the difference in connectivity between 1) schizophrenia patients and controls and, 2) male and female groups. In classifying schizophrenia patients from controls, our model learned the most significant differences were in the VI, SM, and DM networks. Controls show robust connectivity of VI and SM with each other and with other networks, which is missing for SZ patients. The finding of dysconnectivity and/or lower connectivity scores for VI and SM networks for SZ patients is not surprising as there exists ample evidence in prior studies of schizophrenia leading to multiple abnormalities related to visual and motor functions such as perception of contrast and motion, detection of visual contours, and control of eye movements to name a few ( ;  ;  ;  ). These abnormalities certainly affect motor skills which we feel is a reason for the low connectivity for SM and VI networks captured by our model for SZ patients. DICE also captures hyper-connectivity in DMN for SZ patients which is reported by existing studies ( ). \n\nWhereas in classifying gender in the same dataset, DICE emphasized hyper-connectivity in the DM network and hypo-connectivity for the SM network for females compared to males. The differences captured in the DC and DNC for both tasks are supported by existing studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ; van den Heuvel et al., 2010;  ;  ;  ) that show the role of the DMN in gender classification and VI dysconnectivity for schizophrenic patients. Similarly to existing studies ( ; Zhang et al., 2018b), DICE shows that female subjects have higher connectivity between the contralateral homologue brain networks relative to males. \n\nDL models are commonly viewed as black-box models because of the difficulty of interpretation and not easily explained performance on the tasks they are trained on. These models can show excellent performance on tasks such as classification based on the reasons that are not substantially revealing about the input data nor their dynamics. One reason is shortcut learning ( ): a DL model can classify images with or without airplanes with high accuracy by paying attention exclusively to the background (blue sky). Although predictive, such models cannot help in knowledge discovery. To control for shortcut learning we would like to be able to see why predictions are made. One approach is making DL model interpretable. For that a posthoc method is often used, e.g., saliency maps ( ;  ;  ;  ). Such methods explain the input data by finding which part(s) of the input the model is most sensitive to. Saliency maps have shown some good results in computer vision tasks in 2d images. The use of saliency maps in neuroimaging and temporal data has different challenges ( ) as the output maps are noisy, difficult to interpret and does not provide good boundaries nor the connection between different salient regions. Selection of the method for obtaining saliency maps is also something to consider as some of the methods are architecture based. Hence, using saliency maps to get task-specific brain’s connectivity graph is not feasible using current methods. To overcome the black-box nature of DL models and avoid using a posthoc method, we focused on the interpretability of the model’s results. For this purpose, as brain disorders are commonly associated with disruptions in the connectivity pattern of brain networks, we use only the learned connectivity matrices by our model for the downstream classification or prediction tasks, thus making the model extract the abnormality in connectivity relevant to the ground-truth signal. One way to conceptualize about our approach is to think of the generated DC and DNC as a “glass-box layer” (clear and interpretable) layer as noted in  . This approach combines flexibility (the layer is trainable) with interpretability and enables the model to capture differences in the connectivity of the groups in classification task. Regression is also possible with our approach, although we leave it for the future work. Our “glass-box layer” approach enables learning the essential networks and their connection to other networks relevant to the training signal and directly output that without using a posthoc method. As the DC and DNCs estimated by our model are based on learnable functions, the output matrices can have slightly different values when the model is retrained, which is an attribute of DL models. Therefore, all the connectivity matrices shown in the paper are averaged over several randomly-seeded trials. \n\n\n### Task-dependent flexible DNC \n  \nWe fully utilize the flexibility of our DL model to learn task-dependent (ground-truth signal) directed connectivity structures. We show in   that our model estimates DNC structures for the same subjects that are distinct to the ground-truth task of dementia, age, or gender. Hence our model can show the networks and their connectivity crucial for specific downstream tasks. The networks identified by the model through the learned DNC for dementia classification (SM, CB, VI) match the results of prior studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Whereas, for gender prediction, the most prominent network identified by the network was DM, which again matches existing literature ( ;  ;  ;  ). We feel this is a strong validation of the ability of DICE to find disorder-dependent networks and connectivity patterns. We showed in   that our model focused more on SMN than DMN despite having almost two-thirds of female subjects in the test set. This result is significant because the model learned that the SMN connectivity, is more important than DMN for the downstream task of dementia classification and hence enhances the signals for SMN. This eliminates the need to acquire strictly matched subjects with only the difference(s) for which you want to find the relevant networks and connectivity. For example, when trying to find the networks related to schizophrenia using PCC, one needs to find two groups (schizophrenia patients and controls) that do not have any other differences. Extraneous differences would create ambiguity regarding whether the networks identified are related to the disorder (schizophrenia) or some other difference, e.g., gender. Instead of explicitly confronting the confounding factors by regressing them out or taking equivalent measures, DICE performs the “de-confounding” implicitly based on the training labels. \n\nAnother notable property of our model is that it finds the relevant networks and the connectivity structures (sub-graphs) without receiving them during training, making DICE a self-supervised graph learning model. \n\n\n### Dynamic DNC and temporal-attention \n  \nAs hypothesized, and shown in previous studies ( ;  ;  ;  ) results in   show that connectivity between brain’s intrinsic network is dynamic, and dynamic connectivity can capture patterns which are missed by static models. Notably, controls and SZ patients spend different amounts of time in each state 10. Controls spend more time than SZ patients in strongly connected states, especially for visual and sensorimotor networks. On the other hand, SZ patients spend time in weakly connected states and do not often spend time in other states. Similar patterns were observed in FNC studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nMoreover, using all subjects in the FBIRN ( ), our model finds additional states doubling the state resolution. We explain this temporal resolution increase by instantaneity of directed connectivity estimation in DICE in contrast to using a sliding window. Therefore, estimating connectivity instantaneously makes the model robust and finds patterns that are missed when using a window-based approach. Another explanation and an additional factor is the increased richness of representation via a directed graph - the connectivity matrices of DICE have twice the number of parameters compared to FC and FNC. Our experiment with   k  =  10   states show similar patterns of strongly and weakly connected states but they now vary in the direction of the connectivity. This result shows that both the connectivity strength and direction of connectivity are dynamic (changes over time). As this state is rare (based on time spent), it would be harder for window-based approaches to capture it. It would be interesting to see when and how the direction of connectivity changes and how external factors like performing a task can trigger these changes. This, however, is a topic of the future work. \n\nFinally, we show that not all time-points of the fMRI data are equally important to the downstream prediction task and discriminative connectivity matrices exhibit temporal dynamics. Using temporal attention, our model finds important time-points relevant to the ground-truth signal used in training. This further helps in interpretability as our model finds the time-points where the brain activity shows signals relevant to the task. Potentially, this would also be important in task data where the subject is asked to perform different tasks, and the DICE model can be used to find out which task revealed the symptoms of the underlying disorder. Our experiments show that temporal attention assigns stable and consistent weights to time-points across different randomly-seeded tasks. We also notice that a) just 5% of time-points are sufficient for achieving high classification performance and b) exclusion of temporal attention (assigning the same weight to every time-point) negatively affects classification performance. Consistent temporal attention values across randomly-seeded trials further strengthens the evidence of temporally dynamic discriminative DCs and the value of attention mechanism. As our experiments show, our attention module is indeed reliable per the definitions and potential issues discussed by   and  . As a learnable method, DICE and other “glass-box layer” models need to be able to consistently across training runs assign temporal attention values and estimate connectivity between nodes, whereas inflexible methods computing correlations such as PCC do not have this property. In a way, flexibility of the learnable model comes with an additional requirement of stability of learned interpretations. Even though our DICE model works well by showing high classification performance and assigning consistent self and temporal attention values on relatively small datasets, as we show, having more subjects for training leads to an even more consistent assignment of temporal weights in our experiments. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur work demonstrates importance of learnable interpretable estimators of dynamic, directed, and task-dependent connectivity graphs from fMRI data. DICE learns to estimate interpretable dynamic and directed graphs that represent the directed connectivity among brain networks. The end-to-end training process removes the need for existing external methods such as PCC and K-means, which are interpretable but inflexible and strictly depend on the input data. Implementing DICE with glass-box layer allowed us to bypass the need for a posthoc method for interpreting learned model representations. \n\nConnectivity matrices estimated by DICE show how brain connectivity changes across disorders, genders, and age. The learned connectivity matrices help understand the human brain and its disorders as the actual ground-truth connectivity matrix is not available. Furthermore, we moved from FC and FNC to DC and DNC to learn the direction of connectivity and simultaneously removed the issue of window sizing of input data by making the model instantaneous. The learned connectivity matrices provide knowledge that adheres to existing studies. Utilizing flexibility of DL models in learning data representations, we show that using the same data, distinct connectivity structures can be learned based on the downstream task and the ground-truth signal. This flexibility allows acquiring more information from the data by using different training labels, which would require a much more involved process of data selection and manual filtering out of confounding factors for methods that are fully determined by the data, like PCC. Our model highlights different networks linked with the downstream classification task, e.g., the default mode network for gender prediction. Unlike other interpretable models that may pay for it with a decrease in classification performance ( ;  ;  ;  ), DICE beats state of the art methods in multiple classification problems on four neuroimaging datasets. \n\nFor classification DICE uses the learned connectivity structures. Together with the temporal weights these structures are reasonably consistent across varying seeds. Notably, DICE’s performance drops without the use of temporal attention. The temporal attention module of the model finds interpretable bio-markers crucial to performing the classification task and shows that only a small fraction of time-points is enough for attaining maximum performance. Notably, not all time points are discriminative, as evident from the sparse distribution of temporal attention weights in   and high predictive power of just the top 5% of the attention weights of  . \n\nAs the ground truth for the dynamic graph structure in resting state fMRI is unavailable, we believe there is a need for models with “glass-box layer“ like DICE that can estimate this structure based only on the data and classification labels. \n\nIn future work, we would like to omit pre-processing with a dimensionality reduction method—like the used here ICA or region-based parcellation—and train a model end-to-end on the voxel-level data. This, however, may require substantially larger datasets and may not be as useful as the current model for an average sized research dataset. As DICE estimates the direction of connectivity, for future work, we would like to examine how the direction of connectivity changes through time and during tasks for HC and patients. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"c232e112b410f6880b5fba1e0fa897ea"},

Meanwhile, naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms have been an emerging approach for cognitive neuroscience with high ecological validity. However, the test–retest reliability of dFC in naturalistic paradigm neuroimaging is largely unknown. To address this issue, we examined the test–retest reliability of dFC in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under natural viewing condition. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) of four dFC statistics including standard deviation (Std), coefficient of variation (COV), amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and excursion (Excursion) were used to measure the test–retest reliability. The test–retest reliability of dFC in naturalistic viewing condition was then compared with that under resting state. Our experimental results showed that: (a) Global test–retest reliability of dFC was much lower than that of static functional connectivity (sFC) in both resting‐state and naturalistic viewing conditions; (b) Both global and local (including visual, limbic and default mode networks) test–retest reliability of dFC could be significantly improved in naturalistic viewing condition compared to that in resting state; (c) There existed strong negative correlation between sFC and dFC, weak negative correlation between dFC and dFC‐ICC (i.e., ICC of dFC), as well as weak positive correlation between dFC‐ICC and sFC‐ICC (i.e., ICC of sFC). The present study provides novel evidence for the promotion of naturalistic paradigm fMRI in functional brain network studies. \n  \nWe examined the test–retest reliability of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in fMRI under natural viewing condition. Our experimental results showed that both global and local test‐retest reliability of dFC can be significantly improved in naturalistic viewing condition compared to that in resting state.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nDynamic functional connectivity (dFC) has become an important tool to probe the transient functional interactions among brain regions and their alterations in disordered brains (Allen et al.,  ; Damaraju et al.,  ; Fiorenzato et al.,  ; Hutchison et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ). Compared to static functional connectivity (sFC), it enriches the content of functional brain networks and provides a novel way to approach the detailed mechanisms of information processing in the brain. A number of studies have reported that dFC can provide valuable information that is inaccessible with sFC about functional network organizations (Diez‐Cirarda et al.,  ; Leonardi & Van De Ville,  ; X. Zhang et al.,  ). For example, a series of representative functional states have been identified based on dFC and found to be associated with complex brain functions and dysfunctions of neuropsychiatric diseases (Allen et al.,  ; Damaraju et al.,  ; Espinoza et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; X. Zhang et al.,  ). \n\nTest–retest reliability generally measures the test consistency, that is, the reliability of a test measured over time (J. Wang, Han, et al.,  ; Zuo & Xing,  ). The test–retest reliability of functional connectivity (FC) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is crucial for its applications in clinic and has been widely discussed in previous studies (Choe et al.,  ; Guo et al.,  ; Noble, Scheinost, & Constable,  ; Zuo & Xing,  ). The majority of existing FC studies in basic and translational neuroscience focuses on resting‐state fMRI (rs‐fMRI) to search for pathophysiological correlates of neurological and psychotic disorders (Tailby, Masterton, Huang, Jackson, & Abbott,  ; X. Wang et al.,  ; Wehrle et al.,  ; X. Zhang et al.,  ). However, the unconstrained resting state may increase individual variations and make it difficult to separate signals of interest from unwanted behavioral confounds (Sonkusare, Breakspear, & Guo,  ; Tong, Hocke, & Frederick,  ). Recently, naturalistic paradigms including dynamic videos, speech and music designed to study real‐life sensory experience have been proposed and gained increasing interest (Kauttonen, Hlushchuk, Jaaskelainen, & Tikka,  ; Kuo et al.,  ; Marshall et al.,  ; Ren, Lv, Guo, Fang, & Guo,  ; Sonkusare et al.,  ). It has been demonstrated that naturalistic stimuli can achieve improved ecological validity and may be more suitable for challenging populations such as children or cognitively impaired patients (Kim, Wang, Wedell, & Shinkareva,  ; Kuo et al.,  ; Mandelkow, de Zwart, & Duyn,  ). To further validate its potential in functional brain network studies, the elucidation of test–retest reliability of FC in naturalistic paradigm fMRI (nfMRI) is of crucial importance. \n\nIn previous studies, the test–retest reliability of sFC as well as the topological properties of functional brain networks in nfMRI have been investigated (J. Wang, Ren, et al.,  ). Specifically, the natural movie‐viewing paradigm can significantly improve the test–retest reliability of sFC compared to resting‐state. This finding encouraged the application of naturalistic paradigms in detecting longitudinal changes of disease progression for neuropsychiatric brains. However, it is still unknown whether the conclusions are still applicable for dFC (Preti, Bolton, & Van De Ville,  ; Viviano, Raz, Yuan, & Damoiseaux,  ; C. Zhang, Baum, Adduru, Biswal, & Michael,  ). \n\nTo address this issue, the test–retest reliability of dFC in nfMRI was investigated in the present study. A sliding‐window scheme was applied to derive dFC (Li et al.,  ; X. Zhang et al.,  ). Then intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis of dFC statistics including standard deviation (Std), coefficient of variation (COV), amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and excursion (Excursion) as recommended in previous studies was performed to measure the test–retest reliability of dFC (dFC‐ICC) (Choe et al.,  ; Guo et al.,  ; J. Wang, Han, et al.,  ; J. Wang, Ren, et al.,  ; Zuo & Xing,  ). Based on dFC‐ICC, the test–retest reliability of dFC was then evaluated for region of interest (ROI) pairs (ROI‐level), sub‐networks (network‐level) and the whole brain (global‐level). It was found that nfMRI significantly increased global‐level dFC‐ICC compared to rs‐fMRI. Several sub‐networks including visual network, limbic network and default mode network showed significantly higher intranetwork dFC‐ICC in natural viewing condition. In addition, the global dFC‐ICC was lower than sFC‐ICC. We further discussed the relationships among sFC, dFC, sFC‐ICC and dFC‐ICC. In general, the present study demonstrated that nfMRI can improve test–retest reliability of dFC compared to rs‐fMRI and provides complementary evidence to the potential of nfMRI in exploring functional brain networks. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants and experimental paradigms \n  \nTwenty healthy right‐handed subjects (9 males, 11 females; age from 21 to 31 years) were recruited from the University of Queensland. Written informed consent was obtained for each of them. The study was approved by the human ethics research committee of the University of Queensland and conducted according to National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines. Two scanning sessions (Session I and Session II) with a time interval of three months were acquired for each participant. During each session, two conditions of fMRI data were acquired, that is, 8‐min resting‐state and 20‐min natural movie‐viewing stimulus. The resting‐state scan was performed prior to the movie stimulus scan. During the movie‐viewing scan, the participant was asked to freely view a short movie named “The Butterfly Circus” (Nguyen et al.,  ; J. Wang, Ren, et al.,  ). All participants declared that they had not previously seen this film and were asked not to watch it outside the scan sessions before the experiment. Three subjects were excluded: one with technical problem during data recording and the other two without the second scan. Then, only 17 subjects (10 females and 7 males) were included in the study. More details can be found in previous reports (Nguyen et al.,  ; J. Wang, Ren, et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Image acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nStructural and functional MRI images were acquired on a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner using a 12‐channel heal coil (Siemens Medical System, Germany). The scanning parameters were as follows: (a) high‐resolution T1‐weighted MPRAGE images with echo time (TE) = 2.89 ms, repetition time (TR) = 4,000 ms, flip angle (FA) = 9°, filed of view (FOV) = 240 × 256 mm , and voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm ; (b) fMRI images using a gradient‐echo echo‐planar imaging (GE‐EPI) sequence with TE = 30 ms, TR = 2,200 ms, FA = 79°, FOV = 192 × 192 mm , matrix = 64 × 64, 44 axial slices, voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm . Functional images were preprocessed using Statistical Parametric Mapping toolbox (SPM12) and the Data Processing Assistant for Resting‐State fMRI software (DPARSF) implemented in Matlab (Mathworks, USA; Chao‐Gan & Yu‐Feng,  ). The main steps included: removing the first five volumes, slice timing, motion correction, normalization into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, spatial smoothing with a 6‐mm full width half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel, regressing out nuisance covariates, band‐pass filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz) and detrending. More details about preprocessing can refer to previous reports (Nguyen et al.,  ; J. Wang, Ren, et al.,  ). \n\n\n###  sFC   and   dFC   calculation \n  \nThe whole brain was parcellated into 200 region of interests (ROIs) according to the Craddock 200 atlas (Craddock, James, Holtzheimer 3rd, Hu, & Mayberg,  ). Specially, these 200 ROIs can be grouped into 8 sub‐networks according to Yeo 7 network template (see Figure  ): visual network (VN), somatomotor network (SMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), limbic network (LN), frontoparietal network (FPN), default mode network (DMN), and other areas (OA) those are not included in the former networks (Yeo et al.,  ). The OA regions mainly cover parts of the cerebellum, brain stem, thalamus, and caudate. For each Craddock ROI, its network‐label was determined by one of the Yeo 7 functional networks that the majority of voxels within the ROI falls into. It was attributed to OA if the majority of the voxels within the ROI falls out of all the 7 brain networks. In this way, all of the 200 ROIs were grouped into 8 sub‐networks. \n\n####  sFC  \n  \nThe fMRI time series of all voxels within each ROI were extracted and averaged as the time series of the corresponding ROI. Then, the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between each pair of ROIs based on their time series and a 200 × 200 whole‐brain sFC matrix was generated. In this experiment, one resting‐state sFC matrix and one natural viewing sFC matrix was separately obtained for each subject during each session. \n\n\n####  dFC  \n  \nThe sliding‐window strategy was adopted to assess the dFC time series. Briefly, a rectangle time window with an interval of one TR was applied. Within each sliding window, the Pearson correlation coefficients between each pair of ROIs were calculated. Let the full duration of the fMRI time series be   T  ;   T   =   TR × N   where   N   is the total number of time points. Let the length of the sliding time window is   w  ;   w   =   TR × n   where   n   is the number of time points in the window. Then, a three‐dimensional 200 × 200 ×   (N – n +   1  )   whole‐brain FC matrix sequence, that is, dFC time series, was derived. It should be mentioned that, as suggested by Leonardi and Van De Ville, before dFC calculation a high‐pass filtering was previously applied to the fMRI time series that removes frequency component below 1/  w  , to avoid spurious fluctuations of FC time series when the window length was short (Leonardi & Van De Ville,  ). Besides, with respect to the key parameter of the window length in dFC calculation, a sequence of different window sizes ranging from 10 TRs to 100 TRs in increments of 10 TRs were implemented and compared based on the dFC‐ICC analysis results to determine the optimal window length for our data. \n\n\n\n### Test–retest reliability metrics \n  \nThe test–retest reliability of sFC was measured by calculating the ICC of sFC between two sessions for each pair of ROIs and a 200 × 200 whole‐brain sFC‐ICC matrix can be obtained. As the test–retest reliability of dFC is difficult to be achieved directly from dFC time series, a statistic that can quantify the dynamic fluctuation of the time series will be needed. In this study, four statistics including standard deviation (Std), coefficient of variation (COV), amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and excursion (Excursion) were used to derive the dFC‐ICC metrics (C. Zhang et al.,  ). Similarly, one corresponding 200 × 200 whole‐brain dFC‐ICC matrix can be acquired for each statistic. \n\n#### Std \n  \nFor dFC time series, the Std statistic is calculated according to Equation ( ). where   r   is the Pearson correlation coefficient during the time window   t   and   is the average of the Pearson correlation coefficients across all of the sliding time windows. \n\n\n#### COV \n  \nThe COV statistic measures the percentage of variation around the arithmetic mean of the FC time series. It is defined as the ratio between the standard deviation (  Std  ) and the mean of the Pearson correlation coefficients ( ). \n\n\n#### ALFF \n  \nThe ALFF statistic was originally proposed to measure the slow fluctuations of resting‐state brains and found to be effective in seeking the functional abnormality in disorders (Zang et al.,  ). Specially, through fast Fourier transform, the rs‐fMRI time series can be transformed into temporal frequencies and the amplitudes within the generally considered low frequency range were averaged to generate the ALFF metric. Here, as to the dFC time series, the effect of a finite window size is equivalent to applying a low‐pass filter to the FC time series fluctuations with a cut‐off frequency 1/  w   (Leonardi & Van De Ville,  ; C. Zhang et al.,  ). Thus, the frequency components from 0 to 1/  w   were summarized to generate the ALFF statistic for dFC time series, as shown in Equation ( ). where   n   is the number of the frequent components and   α   refers to the amplitude of the   i  ‐th frequency component. \n\n\n#### Excursion \n  \nThe excursion statistic was provided by Zalesky et al. in 2014, aiming to measure the extent of time‐varying fluctuations in the time‐resolved dFC (Zalesky, Fornito, Cocchi, Gollo, & Breakspear,  ). First, a time point   t   was defined as a median crossing point if the signs of   r  —  median  (  r  ) and   r  —  median(r)   are different, where   r   and   r   represent the Pearson correlation coefficients during the time window   t   and   t   − 1, and   median(r)   is the median value of the coefficients across all time windows. All of the median crossing points were collected across time. A pair of consecutive crossing points   defines an excursion from the median value. The longer and larger the excursions are from the median, the greater the evidence of nonstationary behaviors. Therefore, the final statistic is designed by summating all excursions as a function of excursion length and height. where   is the length of Excursion and   indicates the height of the   k  ‐th Excursion.   J   is the total number of all median crossing points. The exponents of   α   and   β   are used to adjust the relative weighting between the importance of long versus large excursions;   α =   .8 and   β =   .3 were used in this study and the influence of their settings were discussed in Section  . \n\n\n####  ICC   analysis \n  \nHere, a one‐way random ANOVA model with subject as random effect was established to calculate the ICC (J. Wang, Han, et al.,  ; C. Zhang et al.,  ; Zuo & Xing,  ). Through the ANOVA model, the between‐subject mean square (  MS  ) and within‐subject mean square (  MS  ) can be derived. Then, the ICC values can be calculated as follows: where   d   is the number of observations per subject (i.e.,   d   = 2 for our data). Based on sFC and dFC statistics of two scan sessions, the corresponding sFC‐ICC and dFC‐ICC (Std/COV/ALFF/Excursion) metrics were separately derived for each pair of ROIs (i.e., ROI‐level). The ICCs were further investigated in sub‐network level. Within‐ and between‐network ICCs were calculated by averaging the ROI‐level ICCs of all possible within‐ and between‐network ROI pairs, respectively. The global‐level ICC was calculated by averaging all the ROI‐level ICCs. \n\nGenerally, once the ICC values are calculated, they can be categorized into some intervals to indicate different reliability performance. However, Termenon, Jaillard, Delon‐Martin, and Achard ( ) suggested that it is more appropriate to assess the reliability by the statistical significance. Thus, the   F  ‐statistic based on the ANOVA model was used to assess statistical significance of ICC: \n\nThe   p  ‐value of the   F  ‐statistic was computed using the degrees of freedom   df  1 = 16 and   df  2 = 17 (for one‐way ANOVA). In general, the larger the   F   value is, the smaller the   P  ‐value will be and the higher ICC (i.e., better reliability) will be achieved. \n\nTo assess the statistical differences of ICC between resting‐state and natural viewing conditions, a paired nonparametric permutation test was conducted under the null hypothesis that the difference of ICC between two conditions is drawn from a distribution with zero mean. First, two surrogate conditions were created for Session I by concatenating random selected samples from resting‐state and natural viewing fMRI data, and the same selection was applied on Session II. Then, the new ICCs and their differences were computed. This process was repeated 5,000 times to generate the null distribution of ICC differences and the true differences in ICC values were compared with this null distribution (one‐tailed test,   p   <.025). \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nAfter preprocessing, a total of 215 volumes were included in the rs‐fMRI data while the natural viewing fMRI data contained 530 volumes. To reduce the influence of volume number on test–retest analysis, the first 215 volumes under natural viewing condition were segmented for the FC and ICC analysis. The 200 × 200 sFC and dFC statistic matrices were separately derived for each subject in each session of rs‐fMRI and nfMRI data. Based on them, one sFC‐ICC matrix and four dFC‐ICC matrices in size of 200 × 200 were obtained for each condition. After removing duplicates in the symmetric matrix, 19,900 elements covering all the ROI pairs were retained for each matrix. \n\n### Determination of the window length in   dFC   evaluation \n  \nWindow length is a crucial parameter in dFC evaluation based on sliding window (Hutchison et al.,  ). A too short or too long window will result in unreliable dFC results. In this study, the optimal window length is determined in conjunction with dFC‐ICC analysis results. As mentioned in Section  , a set of different window sizes ranging from 10 TRs to 100 TRs with a step of 10 TRs were applied to assess dFC time series. The dFC statistics of Std, COV, ALFF, and Excursion were derived and then the corresponding dFC‐ICC values across each pair of ROIs, that is, ROI‐level dFC‐ICC, were calculated for rs‐fMRI and nfMRI. Furthermore, the whole‐brain average dFC‐ICC, that is, global‐level dFC‐ICC, based on the four dFC statistics were computed by averaging the dFC‐ICC values of all the 19,900 ROI pairs and visualized in Figure  . \n  \nThe variations of the global‐level dFC‐ICC along with different time windows (10 TRs, 20 TRs, 30 TRs, …, 100 TRs) based on the four dFC statistics of Std, COV, ALFF, and Excursion: (a) Resting state; (b) Natural viewing \n  \nIt can be observed in Figure   that the global‐level dFC‐ICC based on Std, ALFF and Excursion exhibited similar variations in both conditions as the time window length increased. For resting state, the ICC was maximized at the 30‐TR‐length window for Std. As to the ALFF and Excursion statistics, the second highest dFC‐ICC was achieved at 30‐TR‐length window with a subtle difference from the peak (20‐TR‐length window). For natural viewing condition, the peak values of the ICC curves emerged at window size of 10 TRs and the second highest dFC‐ICC values were achieved at window size of 30 TRs for the three statistics of Std, ALFF, and Excursion. However, the window length of 10 TRs is not an optimal option for dFC evaluation, as a too short window may introduce more fake dynamics that are not belong to the real dFC content and then further influence the accuracy of ICC analysis (Hutchison et al.,  ; Zalesky & Breakspear,  ). Moreover, the peak dFC‐ICC value was obtained at window size of 30 TRs for both conditions in COV statistic. Thus, the length of the window was set as 30 TRs in further experiments. \n\n\n### The   dFC   statistic results for resting state and natural viewing \n  \nThe dFC‐ICC matrices and their differences between natural viewing and resting state using the four dFC statistics were compared, as shown in  . Similar spatial patterns of dFC‐ICC were observed in all the four dFC statistics. The Excursion statistic was with the highest test–retest reliability measure for both resting‐state and natural viewing conditions. This observation is in line with a previous study, which demonstrates that the Excursion statistic performs better in maximizing reliability as well as maintaining individual differences in resting‐state fMRI (C. Zhang et al.,  ). Therefore, the Excursion statistic was selected as a single metric to derive ICC measures for the following dFC‐ICC analysis. \n\nFor each session of rs‐fMRI and nfMRI, the dFC time series and the corresponding dFC Excursion results were calculated using the 30‐TR‐length sliding window and those of one randomly selected subject were shown in  . The group average Excursion matrices of each session for both conditions were shown in Figure  . As mentioned in Section  , the 200 Craddock ROIs were grouped into 8 sub‐networks, that is, VN (1), SMN (2), DAN (3), VAN (4), LN (5), FPN (6), DMN (7), and OA (8) (Yeo et al.,  ). It can be seen that there exists similar excursion pattern in rs‐fMRI and nfMRI, that is, low intranetwork and high internetwork Excursion, indicating less FC dynamics within each sub‐network than between sub‐networks. The distribution of Excursion across all of the ROI pairs for each session of resting state (in cyan) and natural viewing (in magenta) was drawn in Figure  . As to the group difference between resting state and natural viewing in Figure  , paired   t  ‐test was performed separately for each session (one‐tailed test,   p   <.025). For Session I, the intranetwork Excursion tend to be higher in natural viewing than resting state in SMN (  p   = .023, uncorrected) and significant decreased excursion between OA and other subnetworks including VN (  p   = .012, uncorrected), SMN (  p   = .016, uncorrected), DAN (  p   = .004, uncorrected), LN (  p   = .013, uncorrected), and DMN (  p   = .016, uncorrected); while for Session II, significant higher Excursion were found within SMN (  p   = .009, uncorrected) and DMN (  p   = .007, uncorrected), and between LN and DMN (  p   = .005, uncorrected) for natural viewing. However, after multiple comparison correction across all the sub‐network pairs using false discovery rate (FDR) method, none of the above differences were statistically significant (corrected   p   >.025). Furthermore, the whole‐brain average Excursion for each subject was calculated and also compared between two conditions; no significant differences were found between them for both sessions (two‐tailed   t  ‐test,   p   = .635). \n  \nThe Excursion of dFC.

(b) The group average Excursion differences between two conditions: natural viewing (NV) minus resting state (RS). (c) The distribution of Excursion across all the ROI pairs from each session of resting state (in cyan) and natural viewing (in magenta).

For visual clarity, only the SEM of Session I is displayed for each condition \n  \n\n### Statistical analysis of   dFC‐ICC   for resting state and natural viewing \n  \n#### Statistical results of significant   dFC‐ICC   for resting state and natural viewing \n  \nThe ICC results for each pair of ROIs based on the Excursion statistic, that is, ROI‐level dFC‐ICC, were calculated for resting‐state and natural viewing conditions respectively (Figure  ). The average dFC‐ICC results of each sub‐network (i.e., intranetwork ICC, corresponding to the diagonal boxes in the former two matrices) were also shown in the third column of Figure  . The distribution of dFC‐ICC values across all of the ROI pairs for each condition was provided in  . For each pair of ROIs, the   F  ‐statistic was computed during ICC analysis based on one‐way ANOVA model. As shown in Figure  , a total of 5,380 out of 19,900 natural viewing ROI pairs had   p  ‐values lower than .05 and 539 remained significant after multiple comparison correction across all the ROI pairs using FDR correction method (corrected   p   <.05). As a contrast, for resting state, 4,372 out of 19,900 ROI pairs showed significant   p  ‐values (  p   <.05) and only 264 pairs were retained after FDR correction (corrected   p   <.05). \n  \nThe dFC‐ICC and statistical results. (a) The first and second columns were the Excursion‐based dFC‐ICC matrices of resting‐state and natural viewing conditions. The last column showed the average dFC‐ICC results of 8 sub‐networks (i.e., intranetwork ICC) for both conditions. (b) The statistical results of dFC‐ICC based on one‐way ANOVA model. The first and second columns showed the ROI pairs with significant ICC results in red color (  p   <.05). The last column showed the percentages of significant ICC values in each sub‐network for both conditions. (c) The first column was the dFC‐ICC difference matrix, that is, natural viewing (NV) dFC‐ICC minus resting state (RS) dFC‐ICC. The second column showed the paired permutation test of the dFC‐ICC difference (NV − RS) with gray dashed lines indicating 95% CIs. The last column showed the   p   values of each intranetwork average dFC‐ICC difference between two conditions after FDR correction across the sub‐networks \n  \nAs to the intranetwork ICC, it can be observed from Figure   that the natural viewing condition had more significant ICC in VN, LN, DMN, and OA (in magenta dashed circle) while resting state exhibited more significant ICC occupations in SMN and DAN (in navy blue dashed circle). Their difference was small in VAN and FPN. Besides, natural viewing showed a relatively balanced percentage of significant ICC across each sub‐network compared with resting state (the third column of Figure  ). \n\n\n#### Statistical comparison of   dFC‐ICC   between resting state and natural viewing \n  \nAs shown in Figure  , the global‐level dFC‐ICC values of resting state and natural viewing were .180 and .225, respectively, that is, an increment of .045 for natural viewing compared with resting state. As for network‐level, the natural viewing condition showed higher intranetwork dFC‐ICC values in VN, LN, DMN, and OA, but decreased dFC‐ICC values in SMN and DAN relative to resting state, as visualized in the last column of Figure  . The resting‐state dFC‐ICC differed sharply among sub‐networks, ranging from the highest value of .200 (SMN) to the lowest value of .058 (OA). By contrast, the natural viewing condition had a relatively balanced ICC distribution across each sub‐network, varying from the highest value of .189 (FPN) to the lowest value of .113 (LN). The dFC‐ICC values of the other six sub‐networks for natural viewing were all larger than .140. Furthermore, the dFC‐ICC differences of each ROI pair (i.e., ROI‐level) between natural viewing and resting state were also visualized in the first column of Figure  . The distributions of dFC‐ICC for each condition and the dFC‐ICC differences between them across all of the ROI pairs were visualized in  . \n\nTo validate the statistical significance of between‐condition dFC‐ICC difference, paired permutation tests were conducted along ROI‐level, network‐level and global‐level. The global‐level dFC‐ICC of natural viewing was significantly larger than resting state (  p   = .001). When comparing the intranetwork dFC‐ICC differences, natural viewing showed significant increased dFC‐ICC in VN (  p   <.001, uncorrected), LN (  p   <.001, uncorrected), DMN (  p   <.001, uncorrected), and OA (  p   = .010, uncorrected) and decreased dFC‐ICC in SMN (  p   = .001, uncorrected) than resting state. After FDR correction, all of the above differences remained significant (Figure  ). As to the ROI‐level, a total of 3,104 ROI pairs showed significantly increased dFC‐ICC and 2,042 pairs showed significantly decreased dFC‐ICC values for natural viewing than resting state (paired permutation test, uncorrected   p   <.025). After FDR correction, 1,187 pairs out of 3,104 and 641 pairs out of 2,042 remained significant (corrected   p   <.025, see   for more details). \n\n\n\n### Comparison between   sFC‐ICC   and   dFC‐ICC   for resting state and natural viewing \n  \nA previous study has reported that natural viewing condition increased the test–retest reliability of topological properties of sFC compared to resting state (J. Wang, Ren, et al.,  ). In this study, the difference between sFC and dFC was further investigated. Both conditions exhibited relatively higher sFC‐ICC than dFC‐ICC. Specially, the difference results of sFC‐ICC minus dFC‐ICC across all the ROI pairs and sub‐network pairs were shown in Figure  . It can be seen that for most of ROI pairs, the sFC‐ICC exceeded the dFC‐ICC in each condition; their differences were larger for natural viewing, that is, more red points in the difference matrix. Moreover, for network‐level, all of the sFC‐ICC surpassed the dFC‐ICC (Figure  ). The difference value of sFC‐ICC minus dFC‐ICC across ROI pairs ranged from −0.914 to 1.324 for resting state and from −0.770 to 1.339 for natural viewing. According to the sub‐network difference results in Figure  , the intranetwork differences between sFC‐ICC and dFC‐ICC were much lower than internetwork differences for both conditions. \n  \nThe visualization of sFC‐ICC minus dFC‐ICC for resting state and natural viewing: (a) across all the ROI pairs; (b) across all the sub‐network pairs \n  \n\n### Relationships between   sFC  ,   dFC,   and their   ICCs   for resting state and natural viewing \n  \nIn this part, the relationships between sFC, sFC‐ICC, dFC (i.e., dFC Excursion statistic) and dFC‐ICC were explored for both conditions. First, the sFC and dFC Excursion matrices were averaged along subjects and sessions. Then the Pearson correlation coefficients between sFC and sFC‐ICC, dFC and dFC‐ICC, sFC and dFC, sFC‐ICC and dFC‐ICC for each condition were computed and summarized in Figure  . \n  \nThe associations between sFC, sFC‐ICC, dFC (Excursion) and dFC‐ICC matrices as heat maps for all ROI pairs with Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding   p   values: (a) Resting state (b) Natural viewing \n  \nFor both conditions, significant strong negative correlations were observed between sFC and dFC (resting state:   r   = −.898,   p   <.001, 95% CI = [−0.900, −0.895]; natural viewing:   r   = −.896,   p   <.001, 95% CI = [−0.898, −0.893]) while significant weak positive correlations existed between sFC‐ICC and dFC‐ICC (resting state:   r   = .377,   p   <.001, 95% CI = [0.365, 0.389]; natural viewing   r   = .291,   p   <.001, 95% CI = [0.278, 0.303]). Meanwhile, significant weak negative correlations were found between dFC and dFC‐ICC for each condition (resting state:   r   = −.281,   p   <.001, 95% CI = [−0.294, −0.268]; natural viewing:   r   = −.320,   p   <.001, 95% CI = [−0.332, −0.307]). As to the relationship between sFC and sFC‐ICC, the correlation was very low for resting state (  r   = .142,   p   <.001, 95% CI = [0.128, 0.155]) while no significant correlation was found in natural viewing condition (  r   = .006,   p   = .406). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \n###  DFC‐ICC   as a function of the number of   fMRI   volumes \n  \nAs mentioned above, the first 215 volumes of nfMRI data were segmented for dFC and dFC‐ICC analysis to match with rs‐fMRI. When the whole scan data with 530 volumes was selected for dFC evaluation and ICC analysis, the global‐level dFC‐ICC values is 0.330 for 30‐TR‐length time window, larger than the 215 volumes of both conditions. Furthermore, the influence of the involved volumes in dFC‐ICC analysis was investigated based on rs‐fMRI and nfMRI, respectively. With an increment of 5 volumes from 100 volumes to 215 volumes for rs‐fMRI and to 530 volumes for nfMRI involved in dFC analysis, the global‐level dFC‐ICC results were summarized in Figure  . With the number of volumes as the independent factor and dFC‐ICC as the dependent factor, a linear regression model was estimated for rs‐fMRI (  R   = .985,   p   <.001) as well as for nfMRI (  R   = .928,   p   <.001), suggesting that dFC‐ICC was in strong positive relation with the volume number for both conditions. In other words, a longer scan period can achieve relatively better test–retest performance for dFC analysis. \n  \nThe dFC‐ICC variations along with the involved number of volumes in dFC analysis with an increment of 5 volumes (in blue). A linear regression model was estimated with dFC‐ICC as the dependent factor and the number of volumes as the independent factor (red line) for resting‐state (a) and natural viewing (b) conditions, respectively \n  \n\n### The impact of window type in   dFC   evaluation \n  \nIn the present study, a rectangle time window was applied in sliding window dFC estimation. However, various types of windows have been proposed to alleviate the effect of sudden changes associated with the edges of the rectangle window (Allen et al.,  ; Mokhtari, Akhlaghi, Simpson, Wu, & Laurienti,  ). Here, two classical windows, that is, Gaussian window and hamming window, were applied to derive dFC and dFC‐ICC based on the Excursion statistic. The interval of sliding window is 1 TR and the window length was set as 45 TR, that is, 1.5 times of the length of rectangle window (Mokhtari et al.,  ). The dFC‐ICC matrices and their differences between two conditions using the three types of windows were shown in  . All the three types of windows resulted in similar spatial patterns of dFC‐ICC for both resting state and naturalistic viewing conditions. Furthermore, natural viewing condition increases both global and local dFC‐ICC compared to resting state no matter what type of window is applied. \n\n\n### The influence of excursion parameters on   dFC‐ICC  \n  \nAccording to Equation  , two parameters   α   and   β   are involved in dFC Excursion calculation. In this section, the influence of the two parameter values on dFC‐ICC results are summarized in Figure  . Using different parameter combinations of   α   in (.1, .2, .3, …, 1) and   β   in (.1, .2, .3, …, 1), the corresponding global‐level dFC‐ICC results were recorded and visualized in Figure  . It can be found that the highest dFC‐ICC was achieved using the combination of   α =   .8 and   β =   .3 for both conditions. Thus, this parameter combination was adopted in our study. Besides, for the majority of parameter combinations, the natural viewing condition had relatively higher dFC‐ICC values than resting state (Figure  ). \n  \nThe global‐level dFC‐ICC results using different parameter combinations of   α   in (.1, .2, .3, …, 1) and   β   in (.1, .2, .3, …, 1) in Excursion estimation: (a) Resting state; (b) Natural viewing; (c) Natural viewing (NV) minus resting state (RS) \n  \n\n### The difference between   dFC‐ICC   and   sFC‐ICC  \n  \nAccording to Figure  , most of the ROI pairs showed higher sFC‐ICC than dFC‐ICC and the global‐level sFC‐ICC is much higher than the global‐level dFC‐ICC for both resting‐state and natural viewing conditions (J. Wang, Ren, et al.,  ). Specially, a total of 2,744 (13.8%) natural viewing ROI pairs showed high dFC‐ICC (larger than .5) and 2,193 (11.0%) for resting state, while the number of high sFC‐ICC was 10,353 (52.0%) for natural viewing and 6,522 (32.8%) for resting sate. These results were consistent with the findings based on high‐quality human connectome project (HCP) data and other brain atlas (C. Zhang et al.,  ). \n\nThe causes of this phenomenon may be various. First, sFC‐ICC was derived directly from sFC matrix while dFC‐ICC was derived from the dFC statistic, which was an indirect evaluation of dFC variations (C. Zhang et al.,  ). The statistic may not fully represent or describe the dynamic information included in FC variations. Second, dFC analysis is more challenged than sFC analysis. The introduction of temporal dimension largely increased the difficulty and complexity of dFC analysis. Though sliding window estimation method was commonly used, the exploration of accurate dFC evaluation is still ongoing due to the limitations in current approaches (Hutchison et al.,  ). From this view, the accuracy of dFC evaluation method may influence the dFC‐ICC result. Third, high sFC‐ICC means high overall consistence between two scans, while dFC‐ICC focuses on the consistence of temporal segments during the scan; the latter may be more dynamic, complex and uncertain due to the dynamic characteristic of our brain functional activity, no matter at rest or under naturalistic stimuli. This uncertainty may reduce the test–retest reliability when considering the temporal consistency of FC segments between two scans. \n\n\n### Associations between   sFC  ,   dFC,   and their   ICCs  \n  \nAs shown in Figure  , the associations between sFC, dFC, sFC‐ICC, and dFC‐ICC were similar for resting‐state and natural viewing conditions (C. Zhang et al.,  ). First, strong negative correlation was reported between sFC and dFC statistic, in consistent with Zhang et al.'s finding based on high‐quality and large‐number resting‐state HCP data. Given that sFC characterizes an overall FC level of the whole scan, this negative correlation suggests that when the average FC strength is high, the dFC fluctuation is reduced and vice versa. As to the other three correlations, the strengths were obviously lower than Zhang et al.'s results. The negative correlations between dFC and dFC‐ICC suggest that when dFC fluctuates more, the dFC‐ICC will be weakened. Then, for a specific fMRI scan, high temporal FC variations will lead to a low average sFC and degrade the dFC‐ICC performance. The weak positive correlation between sFC‐ICC and dFC‐ICC suggests that dFC‐ICC is consistent with sFC‐ICC to some degree when evaluating the test–retest performance of fMRI paradigms. With respect to the relationship between sFC and sFC‐ICC, different from Zhang et al.'s finding, the correlation was much lower for resting state while no correlation was found for natural viewing paradigm. The above results may suggest that the imaging quality and number of samples may influence the ICC evaluation. A larger number of populations and improved imaging quality may be adopted for further validation in future. \n\n\n### Impact of brain atlas \n  \nTo further examine the impact of brain atlas on our findings, the Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) atlas was applied to evaluate whole‐brain dFC and dFC‐ICC. Using 30‐TR‐length time window, the global‐level dFC‐ICC was .255 for natural viewing and .183 for resting state, similar to the results of using Craddock atlas. The relationships between sFC, sFC‐ICC, dFC and dFC‐ICC were also similar: significant strong negative correlation between sFC and dFC (resting state:   r   = −.897,   p   <.001, 95% CI = [−0.902, −0.892]; natural viewing:   r   = −.894,   p   <.001, 95% CI = [−0.899, −0.889]), weak negative correlation between dFC and dFC‐ICC (resting state:   r   = −.264,   p   <.001, 95% CI = [−0.285, −0.242]; natural viewing:   r   = −.296,   p   <.001, 95% CI = [−0.318, −0.274]) as well as positive correlation between sFC‐ICC and dFC‐ICC (resting state:   r   = .336,   p   <.001, 95% CI = [0.315, 0.357]; natural viewing:   r   = .311,   p   <.001, 95% CI = [0.289, 0.333]). The positive correlation between sFC and sFC‐ICC was also very weak (  r   = .177,   p   <.001, 95% CI = [0.154, 0.200]) for resting state and natural viewing condition (  r   = .035,   p   = .004, 95% CI = [0.011, 0.059]). \n\n\n### Effect of scan order \n  \nThe effect of scan order on test–retest reliability has been discussed in previous studies. For example, Kristo et al. reported higher test–retest reliability of task‐fMRI compared to resting‐state fMRI in motor network detection. They performed the motor‐task before resting‐state scan, but found no scan order effects on the reliability (Kristo et al.,  ). Yang et al. observed significant higher test–retest reliability of task‐based cerebral blood follow (CBF) during psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) than resting‐state CBF in both pre‐ and post‐task resting‐state scans (Yang et al.,  ). \n\nIn the current study, the resting‐state scan was performed prior to the natural viewing scan as it has been reported in previous studies that prior cognitive states may influence resting‐state functional connectivities (Cecchetto, Fischmeister, Reichert, Bagga, & Schopf,  ; Tambini, Ketz, & Davachi,  ; Waites, Stanislavsky, Abbott, & Jackson,  ). We then further inspected the effect of scan order on the test–retest reliability of dFC. Specifically, both the resting‐state and natural viewing sessions were divided into two equal and unoverlapped subsessions (the 1st–108th volumes and 109th–215th volumes, respectively). Then the excursion‐based global‐level dFC‐ICC results were compared between subsession‐pair using different parameter combinations of   α   and   β   ( ). The second subsession was with strongly increased dFC‐ICC compared to the first subsession in both resting‐state and natural viewing conditions ( ), indicating that scan order could be a confounding factor in the evaluation of test–retest reliability of dFC. However, the dFC‐ICC increasement in the second subsession was much higher in natural viewing condition ( ) compared to that in the resting‐state condition ( ), suggesting that the viewers' better engagement in the storyline of the movie stimuli may help to improve the test–retest reliability of dFC. Furthermore, relatively strong increasement of dFC‐ICC was observed in the second subsession of natural viewing condition compared to that in the resting‐state condition ( ), though the dFC‐ICC difference between the first subsessions of the two conditions was not significant ( ). Taken together, these results suggested that natural viewing condition improved dFC‐ICC compared to resting state though the effect of scan order may exist. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nUtilizing two scan sessions of resting‐state and natural viewing fMRI data from the same group of subjects, the test–retest reliability of dFC statistics were investigated and compared between the above two conditions. For both conditions, the global dFC‐ICC was much lower than the sFC‐ICC. Specially, significantly elevated global dFC‐ICC and local dFC‐ICC in visual, limbic and default mode networks were found in natural viewing paradigm compared with resting state. The association between sFC and dFC demonstrated that the more fluctuations of dFC, the lower sFC will be achieved; weak positive correlation between dFC‐ICC and sFC‐ICC as well as weak negative correlation between dFC and dFC‐ICC were also found. The current study demonstrates that naturalistic fMRI paradigm can improve the test–retest reliability of dFC, providing novel evidence for its promotion in functional brain network studies. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare no potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"450c0a50d086dc68c707af662e304981"},

Finding biomarkers more effective to predict AD transition is important for clinical medicine. And current research indicated that the lesion regions occur in both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis paper extracted BOLD time series from WM and GM, combined WM and GM together for analysis, constructed functional connectivity (FC) of static (sWGFC) and dynamic (dWGFC) between WM and GM, as well as static (sGFC) and dynamic (dGFC) FC within GM in order to evaluate the methods and areas most useful as feature sets for distinguishing NC from AD. These features will be evaluated using support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe FC constructed by WM BOLD time series based on fMRI showed widely differences between the AD group and NC group. In terms of the results of the classification, the performance of feature subsets selected from sWGFC was better than sGFC, and the performance of feature subsets selected from dWGFC was better than dGFC. Overall, the feature subsets selected from dWGFC was the best. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThese results indicated that there is a wide range of disconnection between WM and GM in AD, and association between WM and GM based on fMRI only is an effective strategy, and the FC between WM and GM could be a potential biomarker in the process of cognitive impairment and AD. \n\n  \nWhite matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) was combined together for analysis based on fmri only, and the dynamic functional connectivity between WM and GM (dWGFC) was constructed. The feature subset selected from dWGFC had the best classification performance and generalization performance, which indicated the FC between WM and GM could be a potential biomarker in the process of cognitive impairment and AD.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is considered to be the most common type of dementia in the elderly population. Its main features are brain atrophy, loss of neurons and synapses, plaque deposition, and neurofibrillary tangles containing tau protein. AD is usually divided into the following three periods: early, middle, and late. The deterioration related to this disease in patients is accompanied by changes in the white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) of the brain morphology. \n\nDTI technology is currently recognized as a noninvasive method for displaying WM fiber bundles, which can quantitatively analyze the diffusion properties of water molecules in WM to reflect the structural trend of nerve fibers, and plays an important role in detecting and diagnosing AD (Lo et al.,  ; Nowrangi et al.,  ). The characteristics extracted from DTI have also been studied for the classification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD,and have achieved some results (Jung, Lee, Kim, & Mun,  ; Wee et al.,  ). In addition, fMRI has also been used as an imaging technique based on blood oxygen level‐dependent contrast (BOLD) signals for detecting human cortical nerve activity (Heeger & Ress,  ). The brain function network based on fMRI mainly studied the connection between GM regions in different states. The analysis of functional connectivity (FC) between GM in AD patients has a positive impact on revealing the pathological process of AD (Liu, Yu, Zhang, Liu, & Duan,  ; Scherr et al.,  ). \n\nIn recent years, increasing literature has reported WM activities detected by fMRI. For example, activation in the posterior limb of the internal capsule was observed in a magnetic field of 4T (Mazerolle et al.,  ); on the other hand, Tettamanti et al. used specialized task paradigms to detect enhancement of BOLD signals in WM (Tettamanti et al.,  ). Ding et al. observed similar temporal and spectral profiles between GM and WM at rest (Ding et al.,  ) and observed that their relative low‐frequency (0.01–0.08 Hz) signal powers were comparable (Ding et al.,  ). Then, Chen et al. ( ) constructed a functional correlation tensor of WM based on the BOLD signal and used it for the classification of MCI to obtain better classification performance. Furthermore, Zhang et al proposed a noise‐robust functional correlation tensor based on BOLD signals in the white matter and demonstrated its utility in AD diagnosis (Zhang et al.,  ). Ding et al. ( ) compared the changes in BOLD signals between WM under a resting state and WM under a visual stimulation task state, and the synchronous activity and correlation between WM and GM were studied, which provided strong evidence that BOLD signals in WM can reflect neural activity under different states and demonstrated that the fluctuation in the BOLD signals in WM is significantly correlated with specific GM regions. Huang et al. ( ) detected WM activations under visual stimulation by analyzing the spatial distributions of BOLD signal frequency spectra, confirming that BOLD signal variations in WM are modulated by neural activity. \n\nInspired by these results, the current paper examined static and dynamic FC within GM and between WM and GM in order to evaluate the methods and areas most useful as feature sets for distinguishing NC from AD. These features will be evaluated using support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The flowchart of the proposed method is shown in Figure  . \n  \nFramework of the proposed method \n  \n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Materials and preprocessing of rs‐fMRI data \n  \nIn this study, the data used were selected from the publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database ( ). Forty‐five AD patients were selected as the AD group, and 45 age‐ and gender‐matched normal cognitive subjects were selected as the NC group. The specific information is shown in Table  . \n  \nInformation of the subjects included in this study \n  \nThe fMRI images of each subject were obtained with 3.0 T scanners. Images were acquired using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence, it's repetition time is 3 s, echo time is 30 ms, flip angle is 80, slices = 48, and field of view is 212 mm RL, 198.75 mm AP, and 159 mm FH. The voxel size was 3.13 × 3.13 × 3.13 mm , and the SPM12 software package ( ) was used to preprocess the rs‐fMRI data. First, the images were corrected for slice timing and head motion, and subjects with substantial head motion (larger than 2 mm or 2°) were removed from the analysis. Then, T1‐weighed images were segmented into GM and WM, and then, these images were registered to the corrected BOLD image. Next, the fMRI images were normalized into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and the images were then spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with full width at half maximum of 6 × 6 × 6 mm . And a bandpass filter was used to reduce the effects of low‐frequency drift and high‐frequency physiological noise, a signal of 0.01–0.1 Hz was obtained. \n\n\n### Construction of functional connectivity \n  \nEighty‐two ROIs in GM were selected by the Brodmann atlas, and 48 ROIs in WM were selected using the JHU ICBM‐DTI‐81 atlas. By calculating the average BOLD time series of all voxels in each ROI, the regional average BOLD signal was obtained, which reflects the regional neural activity at the corresponding time. \n\nSince rs‐fMRI reflects an unstable spontaneous cognitive activity, static FC loses some information, which may underestimate the complex and dynamic interaction patterns between different brain regions, and dynamic FC changes over time reflecting additional and rich information about brain activities. Therefore, a sliding time window strategy, a popular approach (Chen et al.,  ,  ; Leonardi et al.,  ; Wee, Yang, Yap, & Shen,  ), was used to construct dynamic FC, while static FC was also obtained as a comparison. Specifically, for each subject, the Pearson correlation coefficient, denoted as   r  , of each ROI pair between GM was calculated directly to construct a static FC of GM (sGFC). And static FC between GM and WM (sWGFC) was obtained by calculating each ROI pair's   r   between WM and GM. Then, a sliding time window strategy was applied, and a complete time series was divided into several subsequent series by overlapping windows. We allowed the window length to be 30 and the step size to be 1. Then, the correlation coefficient of each subsequence was calculated and denoted as  , where   i   and   j   represent the   i  ‐th and   j  ‐th ROI, and   k   represents the   k  ‐th subsequence. A complete time series is divided into   K   subsequences. Next, the RMS feature of FC was calculated by the following formula: \n\nThe RMS value is also known as the quadratic mean in mathematics and reflects the fluctuation level of the signals (Chen et al.,  ; Dey & Tech,  ). As a result, the dGFC and dWGFC of each subject were obtained. \n\n\n### Feature selection \n  \nIn the next step, Fisher's   r  ‐to‐  z   transformation, which is expressed as  , was applied to all FC matrices, including static and dynamic, to improve the normality of the correlation coefficients. Then, a two‐sample   t   test was used to select ROI pairs with significant differences to be used as the feature subset for the classification test. For sFC and dFC, we tested different   p  ‐value and corresponding accuracy, selected the feature subset with the highest accuracy. As shown in Figure  , so the features selected from sGFC and sWGFC were chosen when   p   ≤ .001, and those from dGFC and dWGFC were chosen when   p   ≤ .01. \n  \nDifferent   p  ‐value and corresponding accuracy \n  \n\n### Classifier learning \n  \nIn this experiment, the main purpose was to compare feature subsets that contribute more to distinguishing AD from NC, rather than focusing on better classification models. Therefore, the classifier was not optimized, and the SVM classification model was selected and LIBSVM library was performed to implement SVM classification. Studies (Yang,  ) have shown that SVM classifiers have advantages for bioinformatics research. The SVM classifier in this paper selected the linear kernel function. Due to the limited samples, a leave‐one‐out (LOO) cross‐validation was applied to benchmark the different performance of different feature subsets. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Comparison of sWGFC \n  \nWithout a sliding time window strategy, the sWGFC of the NC group and AD group was calculated, as shown in Figures   and  , as in sWFC, where   r   is greater than the set threshold was displayed. Obviously, the sWGFC of the AD group has more loss of connection than that of the NC group. \n  \nsWGFC of the NC group (|  r  | > 0.5) \n    \nsWGFC of the AD group (|  r  | > 0.5) \n  \n\n### Comparison of dWGFC \n  \nA sliding time window strategy was applied, the mean RMS value of the AD group and NC group was obtained, as shown in Figures   and  , where RMS is greater than the set threshold was displayed. There are many areas that have differences in the two groups, and these features will form feature subsets for classification. \n  \ndWGFC of the NC group (|RMS| > 0.5) \n    \ndWGFC of the AD group (|RMS| > 0.5) \n  \n\n### Classification performance of different feature subsets \n  \nFour feature subsets were selected from sGFC, sWGFC, dGFC, and dWGFC. The features selected from sGFC and sWGFC were chosen when the   p  ‐value was <.001, and those from dGFC and dWGFC were chosen when the   p  ‐value was <.01. The features were tested with the SVM classifier, and their performance is shown in Table  . We evaluated the performance of different subsets from the following five indices: accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and   F  ‐score. And the definitions of ACC, SEN, SPE, and   F  ‐score are given as follows: where  , and  . The feature subsets from dWGFC had higher accuracy and better generalization performance. Figure   plots the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for different subsets. In addition, the top 15 features selected from dWGFC are displayed, as shown in Table  . \n  \nPerformance of different methods in classification \n    \nROC curves \n    \nTop 15 ROI pairs selected from dWGFC during classification (  p  ‐value was corrected used FDR [  q   = 0.05]) \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \n### Comparison of classifier performance \n  \nAs shown in Table  , the SVM classifier used a linear kernel function, and LOO cross‐validation was applied. Feature subsets selected from dWGFC achieved a better balance between sensitivity and specificity, and its ACC was 81.11%, which is higher than that of the other three methods. Sensitivity reflected the ability to confirm AD patients, while specificity reflected the ability to confirm a normal control. A better balance between sensitivity and specificity reflected a better generalization ability of the feature subsets, which means that the association between the WM and GM signals based on fMRI has positive significance in distinguishing AD from NC. \n\n\n### Analysis of physiological significance \n  \nTable   shows that the areas involved in the WM included: the posterior limb of internal capsule, the sagittal stratum, the uncinate fasciculus, the genu of corpus callosum, the body of corpus callosum, the superior fronto‐occipital fasciculus, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the fornix. These abnormal phenomena are consistent with those reported in previous studies based on other technology (Fletcher, Carmichael, Pasternak, Maier‐Hein, & DeCarli,  ; Habes et al.,  ; Medina et al.,  ; Shu, Wang, Qi, Maier‐Hein, & DeCarli,  ; Xie et al.,  ). \n\nThe superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and fronto‐occipital fasciculus belong to long contact fibers, which are connected with the cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere. and its abnormality leads to damage of the nerve circuit and affects cognitive function, as well as visual spatial processing, object recognition and memory (Catani, Jones, Donato, & Ffytche,  ). It is generally believed that the structural integrity of the cingulum, fronto‐occipital fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus is closely related to AD (Perea et al.,  ). The corpus callosum and fornix belong to combined fibers, that connect the left and right hemisphere cortices. The complex connection of corpus callosum fibers makes it possible for the functional integration of bilateral cerebral hemispheres to ensure normal development of human emotions and various cognitive activities. As a result, damage to different parts of the corpus callosum may lead to different symptoms (Mielke et al.,  ). The fornix is an important part of the limbic system, which plays an important role in situational memory, emotional behavior and cognition (Nestor, Fryer, Smielewski, & Hodges,  ). Damage to the fornix will lead to cognitive impairment and memory decline in patients. Posterior thalamic radiation and corona radiata belong to projection fibers, and posterior thalamic radiation passes through the posterior limbs of the internal capsule. Damage to the posterior limbs of the internal capsule is closely related to motor and sensory dysfunction in AD patients. \n\nIn addition, the GM ROIs involved included the piriform cortex, the cingulated cortex, the anterior prefrontal cortex, the perirhinal cortex, the fusiform gyrus, the temporal lobe, the parahippocampal gyrus, and the motor and somatosensory cortex. These areas are closely related to olfaction, emotion, learning, memory, and motor, and sensory functions (Chang et al.,  ; Choo et al.,  ; Daulatzai,  ; Golob, Miranda, Johnson, & Starr,  ; Grady, Furey, Pietrini, Horwitz, & Rapoport,  ; Suvà et al.,  ; Wolk, Das, Mueller, Weiner, & Yushkevich,  ). \n\nWhite matter is the area where nerve fibers congregate in the brain and carrying the transmission of information. The loss of connection between different ROIs reflects different degrees of brain damage, leading to different clinical manifestations. The FC between WM and GM can reflect this disconnection more comprehensive, which suggests that we should pay more attention to these changes in the process of cognitive impairment and AD. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nIt should be noted that this study has some limitations. On the one hand, using other statistics to construct dynamic features and representing signals from different perspectives may improve the results of the signal analysis. On the other hand, the number of samples analyzed is not enough, and expanding the scope of the study can lead to more general conclusions. In addition, convolutional neural networks and deep learning have greater capacity in medical image analysis and disease detection, the above two methods are the direction of our future work. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nThis paper studied the FC between WM and GM in the AD group and NC group based on fMRI data. A sliding time window strategy was applied to construct dGFC and dWGFC. Then, a two‐sample   t   test and SVM classifier were used to test feature subsets from four different methods, the association between WM and GM improved the classifier performance. And 15 ROI pairs (  p   < .01) in dWGFC were observed. These results indicated that there is a wide range of disconnection between WM and GM, and the WM time series obtained from fMRI is helpful to study AD, and the FC between WM and GM could be a potential biomarker to predict the development of AD as well as distinguish AD from others. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"83e2eeefdb58653c18c6aee0738e77e4"},

However, the performances of traditional algorithms using static functional connectivity (SFC) measures were unsatisfactory. In the present work, we exploit the hidden information embedded in dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) and developed an accurate and objective image-based diagnosis system for MDD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nMRI images were collected from 99 participants including 56 healthy controls and 43 MDD patients. DFC was calculated using a sliding-window algorithm.

The spatiotemporal characteristics of the most discriminative features were then investigated. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe area under the curve (AUC) of the SVM classifier with DFC measures reached 0.9913, while this value is only 0.8685 for the algorithm using SFC measures.

Temporally, the most discriminative connections transited from the cortex to deeper regions. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe results clearly suggested that DFC is superior to SFC and provide a reliable quantitative identification method for MDD. Our findings may furnish a better understanding of the neural mechanisms of MDD as well as improve accurate diagnosis and early intervention of this disorder. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by depressed mood, lack of interest, and motivation, as well as impaired cognitive function and attention, etc. ( ;  ;  ). This disorder represents a major public health issue and has been predicted to be a leading cause of disability ( ). Recent studies leveraging neuroimaging techniques have deepened our understanding of the neural mechanisms of MDD and revealed abnormalities in brain function and structure in these patients ( ). Current diagnosis of MDD is basically based on structural interview of the patients, which is expert dependent. Developing a machine learning-based approach, which could possibly realize the quantitative characterization of the brain imaging data and achieve an objective prediction of the brain disorders ( ), deserves more attention. \n\nNeuroimaging studies based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have provided rich evidence of abnormalities in neural activity and functional connectivity of multiple brain regions and networks of patients with MDD, including cingulate cortex, precuneus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the default mode network (DMN), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) of the central executive network (CEN), insula of the salience network and the amygdala, hippocampus, etc. ( ;  ;  ;  ). These findings collectively point toward the fact that aberrant functional connectivity can be used as an imaging metric to provide new opportunities for accurate diagnosis of MDD. Likewise, recent studies used fMRI-based functional connectivity measures as eigenvalues to distinguish MDD patients from healthy subjects. Then, after leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), it achieved an accuracy over 70% by support vector machine (SVM) or partial least squares (PLSs) classifiers ( ;  ;  ). \n\nPrevious studies on resting-state functional connectivity were mainly based on the temporal correlation between regional blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time courses, barring an implicit assumption that functional connectivity is temporal stationary ( ;  ). As a matter of fact, a number of researches have revealed that functional connectivity may experience a dynamic change over time ( ), which, to a certain extent, might be attributed to the neuronal origin and related to the cognitive and vigilance state variations ( ;  ;  ). By measuring time-varying functional connectivity among brain regions, dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) analysis furnishes a more detailed description of interactions in the brain. Indeed, some studies have found that the DFC analysis produced time-varying co-activation patterns, which the traditional static functional connectivity (SFC) analysis was not able to obtain ( ). Thus, DFC has been applied to underlie the pathophysiology of diseases such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Parkinson’s disease, migraine, and seizure, etc. For example, increased dynamics of thalamic to sensory network and decreased dynamics of global network were detected in a patient with ASD ( ). Clustering analysis showed that the stability of weak connection decreased while that of strong connection increased in patients with Parkinson’s disease ( ), similar results were found in interictal migraine patients ( ), which imply dysrhythmia in brain connections in these diseases. Besides, a high accuracy was achieved by classifying seizure patients and normal people with DFC analysis, which may help to provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of this disease ( ). In addition, recent research has shown that the metastable state calculated through DFC analysis was correlated to the stage of consciousness ( ;  ), and dynamic fluctuations in functional connectivity were also suggested to be related to individual cognitive states and psychological activities ( ;  ). \n\nDynamic connectivity analysis in patients with depression has provided new insights into the neural mechanisms of this disorder. In particular,   found that meditation in depressed patients is associated with abnormal communication patterns of brain fluctuations ( ).   used the sliding-window algorithm to identify three types of node damage which were related to the severity of depressive symptoms and cognitive ability.   found decreased DFC variability between the anterior DMN and the right CEN compared with controls ( ). It is noteworthy that initial attempts have been made to validate that the accuracy of a machine learning-based diagnosis system could be largely improved by using DFC metrics, instead of traditional SFC measures ( ). \n\nIn the present work, we aimed to develop a machine learning-based scheme for discrimination of patients with MDD by leveraging the hidden information embedded in DFC in order to provide accurate, objective, and image-based diagnosis of MDD. Resting-state fMRI data were collected from 56 healthy controls and 43 MDD subjects. DFC was calculated using the sliding-window algorithm which is the most widely used method to investigate DFC by calculating functional connectivity in a succession of neighboring time windows ( ). Then, a non-linear SVM classifier-based recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) approach was performed to select the optimal feature subset for classification model development with a training dataset. The performance of the established model was then validated with a testing dataset and achieved a favorable accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of 0.9975. Furthermore, we investigated the spatial and temporal characteristics of the most discriminative connections. The results revealed that the most discriminative connections formed core brain networks including the frontoparietal network (FPN), visual network (VN), DMN, etc. The current study demonstrated that by combining features obtained from DFC analysis with advanced machine learning techniques, we can provide an objective and reliable image-based diagnosis system for MDD. More importantly, these findings could also provide novel insights into the underlying neural mechanisms of depression. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nForty-three eligible right-handed MDD patients (13 male and 30 female) were recruited from Xijing Hospital. Fifty-six healthy controls (all right-handed, 30 male and 26 female) were recruited   via   advertising. The baseline demographics of the subjects are shown in  . Two-sample   t  -tests were performed to verify whether there are significant intergroup differences of age and educational level. A chi-square test was applied to verify whether the constituent ratio of gender was significant between the two groups. Statistical analyses of this study were performed by using IBM SPSS statistics (v. 22.0, Armonk, NY, United States). The level of confidence was kept at 95%, and results with   p   < 0.05 were considered significant. \n  \nDemographics for the MDD patients and HCs. \n    \nPatients were tallied with the diagnostic criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) or ASD for a current episode of MDD as assessed by two experienced psychiatrists. The severity of depression and anxiety was assessed by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD, 24 items) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), respectively. Exclusion criteria included incomplete HAMD test, relevant medical or neurological disorders, and incorrect head position, etc. Each of the 99 subjects was informed of the aims and procedures of the research and signed an informed consent. The experiment was carried out in strict accordance with the requirements of the Ethics Committee in Xijing Hospital. \n\n\n### Acquisition and Preprocessing fMRI Data \n  \nThe resting-state fMRI data were acquired at Xijing Hospital using a GE Discovery MR750 3.0 T MRI system. fMRI data were gathered from 99 subjects who completed the functional scan with the parameters set as follows: TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, FOV = 240 mm, matrix = 64 × 64, number of slices = 45, slice thickness = 3.5 mm, spacing = 0.0 mm. Except for the functional data, a whole-brain T1 structural image was obtained for each subject with the following parameters: TR = 8.2 ms, TE = 3.2 ms, FOV = 256 mm, matrix = 256 × 256, flip angle = 12°, slice thickness = 1 mm, no spacing. \n\nThe procedure of data analysis was shown in  . Data were preprocessed using Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI  (DPARSF, version 2.3) ( ). The first 10 scans of the resting-state fMRI images were discarded in order to eliminate the effects of magnetic field instability. The remaining 200 fMRI images were then corrected for slice timing, compensating the differences in acquisition time between slices. Then, realignment was performed to correct for head motion between fMRI images at different time points by translation and rotation. The high-resolution structural image was then co-registered with functional images and segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal. The deformation parameters from the structural image to the MNI template were then used to normalize the resting-state fMRI images into a standard space. Next, a Gaussian filter with a half maximum width of 6 mm was used to smooth the functional images. Then, the linear trends were removed. The effects of white matter signal, CSF signal, and Friston 24 head motion parameters were regressed out. Finally, a band-pass filter of 0.01∼0.1 Hz was used for filtering. \n  \nThe data analysis pipeline. After data acquisition and preprocessing, sliding-window algorithm was applied with the window width set to 50 time points and the step size set to two time points to calculate dynamic functional connectivity (DFC). For each subject, a 1 × 5,653 DFC matrix was obtained after two sample   t  -test and employed as features for classification with a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. \n  \n\n### Dynamic Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nThe DFC analysis was performed by GRETNA  (v2.0.0). The brain was parcellated into 274 regions according to the brainnetome atlas . However, one of the regions numbered 255 with a low probability density was not identified, thus 273 regions were left. Then, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used for measuring the functional connectivity. DFC between any pair of these regions was then calculated using a sliding-window algorithm. Sliding-window algorithm is one of the most widely used to evaluate dynamic brain functional connectivity. The functional connectivity between two nodes was first calculated using a subsection of the data within a time window. The window was then slid one step, and the calculation of the functional connectivity was repeated within the new time window. As recommended in previous studies, the window width should be no less than 1/  f  ,   f   represents the minimum frequency of the signal ( ;  ;  ). In the current study,  f   was 0.01 Hz and the TR was 2 s, thus the window width was set to 100 s (50 time points), and the step length was set to two time points. Finally, we obtained 76 DFC matrices for each subject, with 273 × 273 variables from each matrix. \n\n\n### Feature Extraction and Selection \n  \nThe upper diagonal elements of the functional connectivity matrices were extracted and 76 × 37,128 = 2,821,728 features were left for each subject to constitute the entire feature set. A linear model was used before classification to regress out the effects of gender and educational level. Then, a two-sample   t  -test (  p   < 0.001, uncorrected) was applied to select features with significant intergroup differences between the MDD patients and the health controls, resulting in a 1 × 5,635 feature vector for each subject which is the total features used in the classification. Further considering the high-throughput features extracted from the relatively limited subjects would inevitably cause redundancy and over fitting in classification, in this study, a non-linear SVM-RFE approach was employed afterward to find an optimal feature subset with the best discriminative power for MDD identification. Detailed descriptions of this widely applied approach were presented in our recent studies ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Performance Evaluation Using the Prediction Model Developed by the Selected Features \n  \nWith the optimal feature subset selected, the prediction model was then developed for MDD identification. The non-linear SVM classifier with the radial basis function kernel was implemented using the widely used LIBSVM toolbox for model construction and performance evaluation ( ). Labels of the patient group were set as “+1,” and that of the healthy controls were set as “–1.” The grid search approach was performed to select the optimal parameters “-c, -g” for the classification model construction. Considering the limited sample-set size, an external 10-fold cross validation (CV) strategy with 100-round classifications was used to fully evaluate the performance. This strategy first randomly and almost evenly divides the entire sample set into 10 subsets. Then, nine subsets are used to train the classifier and the remaining one subset is used to validate the trained classifier. After 10 subsets are successively validated, one round classification is finished and the average performance can be obtained. Owing to the random allocation of the 10-fold subsets, only one round classification may not well reflect the overall performance of the samples. Instead, the procedures above are usually repeated for 100 rounds, and the final average performance after all these rounds classifications can be achieved. \n\nIn order to compare the prediction performance of the current results with that of using other brain templates, the widely used Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) template with 116 brain regions was adopted to repeat the steps above, including DFC, SFC feature extraction, and feature selection and classification. \n\nFinally, the extracted DFC and SFC features were combined to classify the MDD patients from the healthy controls in both templates. \n\nIn order to verify the reliability, consistency, and generalizability of the proposed method, the database was further divided into the training set (including 73 subjects with 33 MDD patients and 40 healthy controls) and the testing set (including 26 subjects with 10 MDD patients and 16 healthy controls), accounting for about 80 and 20% of the whole datasets, respectively. The baseline demographics of the training set subjects are shown in  , the testing set subjects are shown in  . Then, a two-sample   t  -test was applied with all the features in the training set to determine the features with significant intergroup differences between MDD patients and the health controls. After that, these features with significant differences in the training set were further selected using the SVM-RFE to determine an optimal feature subset for model development. The performance of the model was then validated using the testing set. \n\n\n### Relationships Between the Selected Features and Clinical Variables in the Major Depressive Disorder Group \n  \nWe performed the Pearson’s correlation analysis between the selected features and clinical variables including HAMD and HAMA in the MDD group separately. Before the analysis, a linear model was used before classification to regress out the effects of gender and educational level. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Feature Selection and Performance Evaluation \n  \nConsidering the imbalance of sample size between the two groups in this study, the AUC value was employed as the criterion for optimal feature subset determination ( ,  ). Finally, a subset of 28 features with the highest AUC value of 0.9975 was selected as the optimal feature subset for model construction, as shown in  . \n  \nFeature selection process of using the support vector machine–classifier-based recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm with 5,653 dynamic functional connectivity (DFC)-based variables and 248 static functional connectivity (SFC)-based variables, respectively. Panel   (A)   represents the curve of the area under the curve (AUC) values using the top   n   features from the DFC matrices, and the red dot in the local magnification of the curve stands for the highest AUC value of 0.9975 achieved by the top 28 features. Panel   (B)   displays the curve of the AUC values using the top   n   features from the SFC matrix, and the blue dot in the local magnification of the curve shows the highest AUC value of 0.8746 achieved by the top 14 features. \n  \nAt the same time, we compared the performances of the system using features obtained from DFC matrices with that of the system using features extracted from traditional SFC matrices. SFC matrices that measured the average functional connectivity were obtained by calculating the correlation between the whole time-series of any two nodes. Thus, for each subject, SFC analysis only resulted in one 273 × 273 functional connectivity matrix, while DFC analysis obtained 76 273 × 273 matrices.   shows the diagnostic performances of the system with SFC matrices. Apparently, the AUC of the system was higher when using DFC matrices (0.9975) which embedded rich information on time-dependent fluctuations in connections than those using static connectivity matrices (0.8746). In addition, with the lack of features extracting time-varying connections, more (14 for static matrices compared with 28 for dynamic matrices) were required for the system to achieve its highest AUC. \n\nWe further assessed the performances of the systems with SVM and 10-fold CV (  and  ).   shows the ROCs of models constructed with the most discriminative features selected from the DFC and SFC metrics. The AUC value of the model with 28 optimal DFC features was 0.9913 while that of the model with 14 SFC features was only 0.8685. The results apparently indicated the superiority of the DFC-based classification model for MDD discrimination. \n  \nPerformance comparison of the 28 selected dynamic functional connectivity (DFC)-based features and 14 selected static functional connectivity (SFC)-based features with a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier and 10-fold cross validation (CV) strategy. The blue and red curves represent the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of using the 28 and 14 optimal features, respectively. \n    \nPerformance comparison between the optimal feature subsets determined from DFC and SFC using the non-linear SVM classifier and 10-fold CV with 100-round classifications. \n    \nThen, we estimated the classification performance using the optimal feature subset selected from the DFC-based features, SFC-based features, and both of the DFC- and SFC-based features with different brain templates. \n\nWith the Brainnetome atlas template, the performance of the optimal feature subset selected from the DFC-based features in the training set was much better than that of SFC, while the performance of the optimal feature subset selected from the DFC- and SFC-based features did not witness a dramatic increase, as shown in  ,   and  ,  . When using the testing data for the performance verification, we observed that the results of the DFC-based optimal features were also the best, whereas the performance of the other two optimal feature subsets received a dramatic decline, indicating the low consistency and generalizability of the models developed by using these two optimal feature subsets. \n\nWith the AAL atlas template, the performance of the optimal feature subset selected from the DFC-based features in the training set was also much better than that of SFC, while the performance of the optimal feature subset selected from of the DFC- and SFC-based features was nearly the same with that of the DFC-based optimal features, as shown in   and  . When using the testing data for verification, we also noticed that the performance of the DFC-based optimal features was the best but was severely inconsistent with the performance of using these optimal features in the training set, as shown in   and  . \n\nAll the results above conclusively reveal that the classification model developed using the DFC-based optimal features extracted from the brain regions using the Brainnetome atlas template could be more powerful for the discrimination between the MDD patients and the healthy people; the SFC-based features could probably introduce certain feature redundancy that might further impair the discriminative power of the prediction model. \n\n\n### Spatiotemporal Characteristics of the Most Discriminative Dynamic Functional Connections \n  \nIn fact, the 28 most discriminative DFC connections were 28 abnormal DFCs in patients with MDD compared with healthy controls. We further investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of the most discriminative dynamic functional connections in patients with MDD. More specifically, the 28 abnormal DFCs involved seven different brain networks and 40 different brain regions, distributed in 24 sliding windows.   shows the spatial pattern of these connections which clearly suggested that these connections form brain networks including the VN, somatomotor network (SMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), limbic network (LN), FPN, and DMN, etc.   provided more detailed information on these connections with their discriminative power (weight). According to  , the connections that demonstrated the highest discriminative power included DFC connections between the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), between parahippocampal gyrus and IPL, between cingulate gyrus and orbital gyrus.   shows the temporal characteristics of these 28 connections. The most discriminative connections within each time window were depicted. We found that over time, the brain area gradually penetrated from the cortex to the deeper regions of the brain. More importantly,   also implicated that the most discriminative connections varied largely from one time window to another. Thus, traditional SFC analysis which is unable to capture the time-dependent variations in functional connections would fail to detect these most discriminative connections. \n  \nThe spatial distribution of the 28 most discriminative dynamic connections after feature selection.

Three main findings emerged from the current study: (1) Patients with MDD could be reliably differentiated from healthy controls based on the patterns of resting-state DFC with a high accuracy of 0.9913 (10-fold CV). (2) Spatially, the most discriminative connections formed core networks including the VN, SMN, DAN, VAN, LN, FPN, and DMN, etc. (3) Temporally, the most discriminative connections were not stationary as assumed by traditional SFC analysis. On the contrary, these connections varied from the cortex to deeper structures of the brain over time. \n\n### Static Functional Connectivity Analysis Versus Dynamic Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nAlthough the high-throughput feature set containing 5,635 variables were obtained from the upper diagonal elements of the DFC matrices, they might not contribute equally for the distinction between MDD patients and the healthy controls. In fact, the features highly correlated with each other or less capable of MDD identification would inevitably cause redundancy for the classifier training, impairing the overall discriminative power for MDD patients. Therefore, the SVM-RFE approach was employed to determine an optimal feature subset for prediction model construction ( ,  ). The classification performance of the model using all the 5,635 variables and a non-linear SVM classifier with LOOCV achieved the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC of 53.49, 71.43, 63.64%, and 0.7072, respectively, whereas these metrics were greatly improved to 97.67, 94.64, 95.96%, and 0.9975 using the model constructed by the 28 optimal features and the same classifier with LOOCV. It apparently demonstrates the effectiveness and great potential of SVM-RFE approach for redundancy reduction, optimal feature determination, and performance improvement. Concerning the LOOCV might introduce the overtraining in the classification, the non-linear SVM classifier with 10-fold CV was further employed to evaluate the performance of the optimal features. The results demonstrate the favorable robustness and consistency of the model for MDD diagnosis. \n\nAs far as we know, most of the previous studies were based on the resting-state functional connectivity, and the accuracy of the distinction between MDD patients and the healthy controls varied between 76.10 and 91.90% ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, a growing number of studies suggest that resting-state functional connectivity may hide some information, which could be fully reflected in DFC ( ;  ). In order to compare the capability of the DFC and SFC matrices for the quantitative characterization of patients with MDD, the prediction model using the optimal features extracted from the SFC matrix was also developed. The classification performance was apparently inferior to that of the DFC-based prediction model, denoting that the DFC might effectively describe the network changes associated with the feelings and executive function that closely relate to MDD, thus could obtain more excellent classification performance when used for MDD identification ( ). \n\nThe potential explanation of the superiority of the DFC-based prediction model is that during the resting-state scanning, subjects were required to simply close their eyes without thinking about anything. However, there still exist mind wandering and attention return. These cognitive processes may lead to huge fluctuations of brain connections during scanning ( ). Such time-varying information of the spontaneous brain activity could not be reflected in SFC but might be captured by DFC using the sliding-window algorithm with appropriate window width and step size. \n\nBesides, the results of the DFC-based prediction model further suggest that the present method could not only improve the classification performance in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches ( ) but also shed light upon the temporal patterns of brain activity and their applications in brain disorder diagnoses. \n\n\n### Spatial Characteristics of the Most Discriminative Connections \n  \nUsing the SVM-RFE approach, we selected 28 optimal features from 5,635 dynamic functional connections obtained in 76 time windows. The spatiotemporal characteristics of these most discriminative connections were then investigated by mapping these connections into the 76 DFC matrices to reconstruct the spatial patterns and analyze the temporal characteristics of these connections. Interestingly, we noted that although several brain networks were implicated, a large portion of these connections were associated with the FPN, VN, and DMN. The findings indicated that these regions contributed largely to accurate classification of MDD patients with healthy controls and thus may play an important role in the neural mechanisms of MDD. \n\nThe most discriminative connections formed several core brain networks including the VN, SMN, DAN, VAN, LN, FPN, and DMN, etc., suggesting that connectivity of these networks may be disrupted in patients with MDD. The results are in line with numerous previous studies that have observed abnormal connectivity of these networks ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ). Among these networks, the connection between MFG and IPL demonstrated the most significant contribution to the accurate classification of MDD patients with healthy controls. Previous researchers found that MFG and SFG showed decreased functional connectivity in MDD with robustness ( ;  ).   found that the global functional connectivity of the right IPL increased in MDD patients compared with the control group in two distinct datasets, and IPL is one of the discriminative effective connections when distinguishing MDD patients and healthy controls in a classification study with an accuracy of 91.67% ( ). More importantly, both of the MFG and IPL are subregions of FPN, which is a cognitive control network, especially a goal-directed regulation of attention and emotion, etc. ( ).   found disruption of normative pathways in FPN in MDD, and others found abnormal connections between FPN and some networks such as DMN in MDD ( ). These results were consistent with those of a cognitive model that disorders of goal-directed attention and emotion can lead to excessive rumination ( ). Besides, another study also reported that three subnetworks in the FPN of MDD patients had increased functional connectivity before treatment and recovered after treatment, which makes it a potential target for antidepressant therapy ( ). \n\nDefault mode network is a central network for MDD which was verified in numerous researches in the last decades, most of results contribute to a conclusion that the aberrant function and structure of it was related to depressive rumination.   found that rumination was correlated negatively with the volume of gray matter in the anterior cingulate cortex and other regions. In the functional connectivity analysis, a meta-analytic result showed an increased connection between DMN and subgenual prefrontal cortex, which was able to predict rumination level ( ). Besides, a DFC analysis was conducted by  , and they reported that the increased DFC between the mPFC and the insula was correlated with the level of rumination. However, a recent study applied a multicenter research with 1,642 participants and reached a conclusion that reduced but not increased connection was only in recurrent MDD, and this had a positive relation with symptom severity ( ). Our result also showed that the DFC between the precuneus and SFG was significantly positively correlated with HAMA scores. \n\nVN was also an important region that contributed to classification. Our findings are consistent with recent studies that have noticed functional and structural abnormalities in the VN in MDD patients.   used SFC analysis to classify patients with MDD and healthy controls, and they reported that the VN was among the most discriminative regions ( ). Latterly, in the study of functional connectivity density (FCD), a decrease in long-term FCD of supraoccipital gyrus was found, suggesting that the visual cortex is a key hub for MDD ( ). In addition, the structure of the VN was also impaired in the patients. Significantly thinner calcarine gyrus was found in MDD patients than in healthy controls ( ). Occipital bending is a powerful biomarker for depression, and patients with occipital bending were reported to have abnormal cortical thickness in the posterior occipital lobe ( ). Notably, a recent study revealed that brain regions associated with early awakening and visual processing overlap in patients with MDD ( ). Thus, impairments in the visual areas may result in disruption of sleep rhythms and symptoms of sleep disturbances generally seen in patients with MDD. \n\nWhen analyzing the temporal characteristics of the most discriminative features, we found that these connections were distributed in different time windows, reflecting the non-stationary characteristics of functional connectivity over time which has been consistently noticed in literature ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). These results thus provide an explanation why the classification model with the DFC features could achieve better performances than the model with SFC features, since traditional static analysis may eliminate the contribution of the more volatile connections ( ;  ;  ). Furthermore, we noticed that the most discriminative connections gradually changed from cortical regions to deeper structures of the brain over time, suggesting a switch between the cortical and limbic systems in the patients at rest. \n\nTo summarize, the current study used a data-driven machine learning approach to demonstrate that by leveraging valuable information embedded in DFC metrics, we could provide an accurate diagnosis scheme for patients with MDD. The spatiotemporal characteristics of those most discriminative connections could provide a novel insight into the neural mechanisms of this disorder. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThis study has some limitations and caveats to bear in mind. Although sliding-window algorithm is one of the most widely used methods to investigate DFC, a recent study has suggested that this algorithm tends to suppress dynamic correlation, especially those that change rapidly with time ( ). In addition, the step size and window width should be carefully set for the sliding-window algorithm. For the current study, we set the window width to 50 time points and the step size to two time points as suggested by previous studies ( ). We will further investigate the effects of different parameter settings in future studies. Finally, we used machine learning to successfully distinguish depression patients from normal people. However, the sample size in the current study is relatively small. Future studies may independently replicate our results on large sample datasets. Despite many limitations, our study suggested that by combining dynamic resting-state functional connectivity analysis and machine learning techniques, we were able to provide a reliable imaging-based quantitative identification of major depression for early intervention in MDD patients. \n\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee in Xijing Hospital.

Although voxel‐wise connectivity studies have examined different sliding window lengths, nonsequential volume‐wise approaches have been less common. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nInspired by earlier co‐activation pattern (CAP) studies, we applied hierarchical clustering (HC) to classify the image volumes of the RS‐fMRI data on 28 adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their 27 typically developing (TD) controls. We compared the distribution of the ASD and TD groups' volumes in CAPs as well as their voxel‐wise means. For simplification purposes, we conducted a group independent component analysis to extract 14 major RSNs. The RSNs' average   z  ‐scores enabled us to meaningfully regroup the RSNs and estimate the percentage of voxels within each RSN for which there was a significant group difference. These results were jointly interpreted to find global group‐specific patterns. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe found similar brain state proportions in 58 CAPs (clustering interval from 2 to 30). However, in many CAPs, the voxel‐wise means differed significantly within a matrix of 14 RSNs. The rest‐activated default mode‐positive and default mode‐negative brain state properties vary considerably in both groups over time. This division was seen clearly when the volumes were partitioned into two CAPs and then further examined along the HC dendrogram of the diversifying brain CAPs. The ASD group network activations followed a more heterogeneous distribution and some networks maintained higher baselines; throughout the brain deactivation state, the ASD participants had reduced deactivation in 12/14 networks. During default mode‐negative CAPs, the ASD group showed simultaneous visual network and either dorsal attention or default mode network overactivation. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nNonsequential volume gathering into CAPs and the comparison of voxel‐wise signal changes provide a complementary perspective to connectivity and an alternative to sliding window analysis. \n\n  \nCo‐activation patterns (CAPs) of resting state brain activity varyingly contain both default mode network (DMN)‐positive and default mode network‐negative brain state properties. With hierarchical clustering, they can be divided into shorter substates. When applied in autism spectrum disorder, this method showed simultaneous visual network and either dorsal attention or DMN overactivation during DMN‐negative CAPs. Nonsequential volume gathering into CAPs provides an alternative to sliding window analysis.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nAccording to the latest draft of WHO's International Classification of Diseases, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is usually a pervasive but contextually varying feature of an individual's functioning observed in all settings: for example, personal, family, social, educational, and occupational interactions. ASD is characterized by persistent deficits in one's ability to initiate and sustain reciprocal social interaction and social communication, as well as by a range of restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behavior and interests (World Health Organization,  ). Subjects with ASD prefer to focus on only a restricted number of repeating and controllable sensory information instead of the subtle and irregular cues of multisensory information needed in social communication. The etiology and expression of ASD are highly diverse, and the recent changes in the diagnostic criteria from categorical to dimensional reflect this growing understanding (Betancur,  ; Lord & Jones,  ; Mattila et al.,  ; Park et al.,  ; Varghese et al.,  ; Waye & Cheng,  ). \n\nResting state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examines spontaneous brain function by using blood oxygen level‐dependent (BOLD) contrast in the absence of a task. Traditionally, RS‐fMRI analysis has relied on a temporally stationary functional connectivity (FC) measure, in which the correlations between the voxel time series of brain regions are examined as unchanging over time. Previously, ASD has been affiliated with altered RS intrinsic FC, and the literature supports a diffuse pattern of both, rather than only under‐ or overconnectivity. Even a recent, thorough review of RS FC in ASD with nearly 70 analysis citations found it challenging to draw direct conclusions about the nature of FC in ASD (Hull et al.,  ). Since the seminal work of Chang and Glover ( ), the last decade has seen a growing trend and a deliberate effort to characterize dynamic changes in brain connectivity as a function of time, dynamic FC (dFC) or time‐varying FC (TVFC). The most widely used temporal sliding window approaches to between‐voxel correlations have demonstrated that FC in the brain has time‐varying properties (Allen et al.,  ; Chang & Glover,  ; Hutchison et al.,  ; Kiviniemi et al.,  ; Lurie et al.,  ; Preti et al.,  ). It has been suggested that greater intraindividual dynamic variance is a potential biomarker of not only ASD but also mental disorders such as schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and that it may underlie confusing static FC measures (Chen et al.,  ; Falahpour et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). It is also important to recognize that the same static FC pattern could result from many different combinations or sequences of shorter spatiotemporal patterns of underlying TVFC (Lurie et al.,  ). \n\nOf the existing TVFC methods, the co‐activation pattern (CAP) approach deviates from conventional time‐domain approaches by regarding single fMRI volumes at individual time points, instead of fMRI time courses, as the basic units of analysis (Liu et al.,  ). Hindriks et al. ( ) suggest that CAPs could be the building blocks of spontaneous BOLD activity and that dFC is a reflection of these. As Tagliazucchi et al. ( ) state: \"Instead of asking whether two voxels are engaged in synchronized fluctuations over a relatively long period of time, the question is shifted to whether two voxels become jointly activated (i.e., present high activity above their baseline levels) and what are the timings and properties of these co‐activations.\" The beginning of the development of CAP analysis can be traced to when Tagliazucchi et al. ( ) established their point process analysis and observed that the timing of high‐activity events in BOLD signals allows the reconstruction of major RS networks (RSNs). Soon after, Liu and Duyn ( ) applied K‐means clustering to arrange single fMRI volumes into groups and averaged this data group‐wise to produce distinct spatial CAPs. Related studies have been conducted by other groups using CAP (Bolton et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Di Perri et al.,  ; Zhuang et al.,  ; recent CAP review by Liu et al.,  ) or other terms such as coincident threshold crossings (Hudetz et al.,  ) and modes (Li et al.,  ). \n\nConstellations of different intrinsic connectivity network (ICN) patterns have previously been referred to as brain states (Allen et al.,  ). Although in our study, CAPs are not calculated as time‐varying FC matrix representations as illustrated by Allen et al. ( ), they can be seen as representing the same brain states, as a timeline of various spatiotemporal clusters of (de)activation patterns of independent RSNs (Preti et al.  ). These brain states are visualized as a mean image of multiple volumes (Figure  ) in which RSNs (Figure  ) are in sufficiently similar phases of activation as determined by a clustering algorithm. If the number of states or CAPs depicting the same data is increased, the amount of time for which one CAP is represented grows proportionately shorter. In CAP analysis, the gathered volumes do not have to be sequential, and voxel signal levels per se can be evaluated. These two issues present the major differences from most sliding window TVFC analyses (Liu et al.,  ; Lurie et al.,  ; Preti et al.,  ). \n  \nHierarchical clustering result dendrogram. Top, hierarchical clustering (cosine distance, Ward's method) result dendrogram of 11,930 resting state (RS) fMRI volumes of 55 adolescent participants. The   x  ‐axis shows the study‐specific distances between the clusters as height h. When h = 0, each volume forms its own cluster, and h≈3.48 (dashed blue line on the right) corresponds to splitting the volumes into 30 clusters. Due to image resolution limitations, the volumes were merged as the thickened black column on the   y  ‐axis. The lower part of the figure highlights the cluster levels from 02 to 30 as a cladogram, which shows the relations between the CAPs. The first number indicates the total cluster count at that level. The second number was determined by the clustering algorithm that showed the cluster's ordinal number for only that hierarchical level. For the sake of visualization, in the cladogram, the branch lengths have been scaled equal, as opposed to a dendrogram. Each CAP's   z  ‐statistic map slice is shown from the same level of anterior and dorsal nodes of the default mode network (DMN). The lower DMN‐negative or \"task‐positive\" branches of the cladogram comprise 4,658 volumes (39%), and the upper DMN‐positive branches 7,272 volumes (61% of the whole data) of the RS‐fMRI data. Further CAP volume distributions (Figures  a‐b) are detailed in Appendix  . The   z  ‐statistic color keys range from −20 to −3.5 and from 3.5 to 20 \n    \nStudy‐specific cores of 14 resting state networks (FSL MELODIC group ICA components). The components are ordered column‐wise according to the explained variance. Overlapping areas were removed by assigning each voxel to only one IC, where it had the highest absolute   z  ‐statistic over the other ICs. The component areas were only used as voxel‐wise masks and a simple atlas to label brain areas when interpreting CAP results. Images of the combined 14 components and study mask are also displayed. The   z  ‐statistic color key ranges from 0 (black) to 14 (white) \n  \nFrom the CAP methods, the following can be distinguished 1) seed‐based methods (e.g., Amico et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Di Perri et al.,  ; Liu & Duyn,  ), in which the volumes for analysis are selected via predefined seed voxel or region thresholds and in which interactions with the rest of the brain are probed, and 2) seed‐free analyses, such as ours, in which the clustering algorithm is applied to all volumes in an entirely data‐driven way (e.g., Bolton et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ,  ). Another relevant distinction between studies is that most earlier studies have focused on temporal properties or CAP metrics, such as the occurrence rate, dwell time, and transition probability (e.g., Bolton et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ), whereas the most salient findings in our study concentrate on the spatial differences across the groups (also see Amico et al.,  ; Di Perri et al.,  ). \n\nIn CAP analysis, BOLD fMRI volumes are described by their voxels' signal amplitudes, and their relation to other volumes can be defined via a suitable function, such as the Pearson correlation coefficient (Chen et al.,  ; Di Perri et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Liu & Duyn,  ; Yao et al.,  ) or cosine distance (Karahanoğlu & Van De Ville,  ). fMRI studies have utilized hierarchical clustering methods with a voxel‐wise approach (Liu et al.,  ; Thirion et al.,  ; Wang & Li,  ; Wang et al.,  ) and with FC analysis (Kam et al.,  ). Agglomerative algorithms are deterministic and do not require a predetermined number of clusters (as opposed to k‐means clustering). To decide which data objects (here fMRI volumes) are combined during hierarchical clustering, we chose Ward's method. This belongs to minimum variance methods and uses one variant of the Lance–Williams dissimilarity update formula, sharing the total error sum of squares criterion with k‐means clustering (Murtagh & Legendre,  ). \n\nAs individual CAPs reflect the continuous flow of time‐varying information within functional brain networks (Liu et al.,  ), we wanted to study whether the effects of restricted, narrow focusing of attention to limited information sources typical to ASD can be detected in the clustering of CAP information. To determine possible CAP differences between adolescents with ASD and typically developing (TD) controls, we compared the distribution of the ASD and TD groups' volumes in CAPs as well as their voxel‐wise means. This enabled us to determine the specific differences between the (de)activation patterns of the two groups. The number of CAPs in earlier studies ranges from 4 (Li et al.,  ) to 30 (Liu et al.,  ), and we addressed this range accordingly. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Dataset \n  \nThe study population, detailed diagnostic criteria, and all the data were the same as those used by Paakki et al. ( ). As fMRI preprocessing methods have advanced, in the present study, we utilized them as described below. \n\nThe study population consisted of 55 adolescents, of which 28 had ASD (with normal IQ, age 14.58 ± 1.62 years, 20 males, 8 females, three left‐handed) according to ICD‐10 research criteria (World Health Organization,  ) and 27 were TD‐matched controls (age 14.49 ± 1.51 years, 18 males, 9 females, two left‐handed). The MR data were collected using a GE 1.5 T Signa HDX scanner with an eight‐channel parallel imaging head coil. Before the scan, the participants were asked to lie still, remain relaxed and awake, and look at a white cross in the middle of a dark‐gray screen. The 7.5 min RS BOLD fMRI scanning consisted of 253 whole brain volumes. The parameters of the gradient‐recalled echo‐planar imaging (GRE EPI) were as follows: TR 1.8 s, TE 40 ms, flip angle 90°, FOV 256 mm, 64 × 64 in‐plane matrix, 4 × 4 × 4 mm voxel size, and 28 oblique axial slices with a 0.4 mm gap and interleaved acquisition order. We acquired the structural data using a T1‐weighted 3D FSPGR sequence with 1 mm oblique axial slices, FOV 24.0 × 24.0 cm with a 256 × 256 matrix. \n\nAll participants and their parents gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of the Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Preprocessing of RS‐fMRI signals \n  \nFor anatomical data, we used FSL‐VBM FNIRT to register individual T1 structural head volumes and generate a study‐specific template (Andersson et al.,  ; Douaud et al.,  ; Good et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ). After skull stripping, the FSL's FIRST segmented cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter (WM), and gray matter (GM) (Patenaude et al.,  ). \n\nFor the functional data, AFNI's (Cox,  ; Cox & Hyde,  ; Gold et al.,  ) \"afni_proc.py\" program produced preprocessing pipeline according to the program's help page examples 9b and 10 ( ) and following the guidelines of Jo et al. ( ). We removed the first three volumes to avoid T1 effects and computed the outlier fractions for each volume. Motion correction was applied, and the skull was stripped. Exploiting the results of our earlier FSL‐VBM procedure and the study‐specific average template, we applied a nonlinear transformation to functional data. \n\nAfter these steps, we interrupted the AFNI pipeline and ran the independent component (IC) analysis‐based automatic removal of motion artifacts (ICA‐AROMA) for the functional data. The median number of ICs left after artifact removal was 14.5 in ASD and 13 in the TD group (Wilcoxon rank‐sum test   p  ‐value = .41). The nonaggressive option was implemented in the participant‐wise removal of artifact components (Pruim et al.,  ; Pruim, Mennes, van Rooij, et al.,  ). \n\nThe AFNI pipeline continued with despiking. The volumes with a displacement of >0.2 mm or with a normalized signal level of over 1.29 (outlying 10% of expected   SD  ) were labeled for censoring (Aurich et al.,  ; Nichols,  ; Power et al.,  ,  ). On average, 13.2% (min. 0%, max. 45.6%) of the time series were censored. The shortest time left was 4 min 5 s, which was still considered adequate (White et al.,  ). After censoring, 13,750 volumes were reduced to 11,930: The TD participants had an average of 223 volumes, and the ASD participants 210 volumes left (Wilcoxon rank‐sum   p  ‐value = .34). \n\nFor full details on preprocessing, Appendix  . We did not regress the global signal. We performed spatial smoothing with 8 mm (~2 voxels) full width at half maximum kernel (Chen & Calhoun,  ) and calculated high pass temporal filtering regressors for frequencies of <.005 Hz. Removal of trends, censoring, temporal filtering, motion, once eroded CSF mask, and local WM (ANATICOR) regressors were combined into a regression matrix with AFNI 3dDeconvolve and projected out of the smoothed data in one step with the AFNI 3dTproject to remove any possible residual noise (Jo et al.,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Group independent component analysis \n  \nWe created uncensored but otherwise similarly preprocessed datasets with FSL MELODIC multisession temporal concatenation analysis and estimated group‐level ICs. These were used as masks and a simple atlas to label brain areas when interpreting the CAP results. We adjusted the dimensionality to 14 ICs and chose the low dimensional approach for the sake of pragmatic visual pattern analysis, but still covered major networks in line with earlier studies (Castellazzi et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ; Starck et al.,  ; Thornburgh et al.,  ; Yeo et al.,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Hierarchical clustering and extraction of CAPs \n  \nThe preprocessing continued in MATLAB  (MathWorks , 2016; Shen,  ). The fMRI signal was temporally normalized voxel‐wise for each participant by subtracting the mean and then dividing by the temporal   SD   (Liu et al.,  ). The individual datasets were masked using combined GICA components and GM voxels (Figure  ). These volumes and mask were later used with FSL randomise. \n\nThe volumes were reshaped and concatenated, and the resulting data matrix was transferred to the R environment (Bengtsson,  ; R Core Team,  ). We applied clustering to all the BOLD fMRI volumes acquired from the 55 participants that had survived censoring. As mentioned in the introduction, the volumes are described by their voxels' signal amplitudes, and their relation to other volumes has to be defined via a suitable function. Here, individual volumes were represented as 29,684‐dimensional vectors, and a matrix containing the pairwise cosine similarity among all the 11,930 vectors was calculated. \n\nAs we were interested in the spatial similarity of the volumes and the corresponding \"directionality\" of the voxels' signals (above or below average) rather than their absolute amplitude strength, we chose to use the cosine similarity, which is invariant to the scaling of the data. In other words, excluding anticorrelated patterns, we tried to prevent spatially similar patterns in different phases and with different signal amplitudes from going into different clusters. The Pearson correlation coefficient and cosine similarity are related measures, but the Pearson correlation is also invariant to adding any constant to all data elements, which we considered to possibly have a global signal regression (GSR) type of effect on clustering (Manning et al.,  ; Murtagh & Contreras,  ; Singhal,  ). \n\nA cosine similarity matrix was converted to a distance matrix, as we performed hierarchical clustering using R fastcluster‐package function hclust (method = \"ward.D2\") (Müllner,  ). The results from 30 to 2 clusters (in total, 58 clusters or CAPs) were evaluated. We aggregated the fMRI volumes assigned to each cluster. The mean image of such a cluster's volumes provided an overall view of the resulting CAP and was then normalized by the standard error (within‐cluster and across fMRI volumes) to generate   z  ‐statistic maps, which quantify the degree of significance to which the CAP map values for each voxel deviate from zero (Liu et al.,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Group comparison   t   tests \n  \nThe 11,930 RS‐fMRI volumes concatenated into one file were used as input for FSL's randomise (Anderson & Robinson,  ; Winkler et al.,  ). The voxel‐wise differences between the ASD and TD groups were assessed for each CAP using two‐sample unpaired   t   tests (10,000 permutations). The design matrix for each hierarchy level included all the volumes as rows and all the clusters, that is, CAPs existing at that level of the hierarchy, as columns, with separate columns for the TD and ASD participants. We created within‐group and between‐group contrast files for the CAPs and used participant‐wise exchangeability block labels. The resulting threshold‐free cluster enhancement (TFCE) uncorrected   p  ‐value maps were merged, and the false discovery rate (FDR) corrected across all the contrasts using FSL's fdr (q = 0.05), which gave a   p  ‐value threshold of .004, corrected for two‐tailed results at   p   <.002 (Anderson & Robinson,  ; Benjamini & Hochberg,  ; Genovese et al.,  ). We used MRIcron (Rorden & Brett,  ) and R packages ape (Paradis & Schliep,  ), dendextend (Galili,  ), dendsort (Sakai et al.,  ), dplyr (Wickham et al.,  ), ggtree (Yu et al.,  ), ggplot2 (Wickham,  ), gplots (Warnes et al.,  ), plyr (Wickham,  ), and RColorBrewer (Neuwirth,  ) to aid data visualization. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nThe median number of fMRI volumes assigned to each CAP from either the ASD or the TD participants' data was calculated with bootstrapped confidence intervals (95%, 10,000 resamples), which were overlapping (Figure  ). The Mann–Whitney test   p  ‐value was <.05 in seven CAPs but became nonsignificant after FDR correction. Thus, we found no reliable ASD‐ or TD‐specific CAPs within the cluster levels used in our study (from 2 to 30). The number of volumes in each CAP (Figures  a‐b) and the images of each CAP (Figures  a‐i), and when found, their group activation differences (Figures  a‐i), are visualized in Appendix  . \n  \nThe median number of fMRI volumes per subject in CAPs with confidence intervals and outlier dots. The outliers may reflect individual differences in time spent in default mode‐positive or task‐positive brain states. As described earlier, participant‐wise, censoring excluded on average 13 volumes more from the ASD data than from the TD data \n  \nThe clustering of the whole RS‐fMRI data reveals a familiar‐looking division into two main cluster groups. At the highest level of the cladogram (Figure  ), the first level of branching, there are only two CAPs, and each fMRI volume belongs to one or the other. The first CAP (02–01, 39% of the 11,930 volumes) resembles a task‐positive ICN as its fMRI volumes contain below‐average values in lateral visual, default mode, language, and frontoparietal cognitive control (FPC) networks, but above‐average values in dorsal attention (DAN), medial visual, somatosensory, motor, auditory, salience, and ventral attention (VAN) networks. The second CAP (02–02, 61% of the volumes) shows a reversal in the activity patterns with above‐average values in default mode network (DMN) and corresponding opposite values in other networks embodying task‐negative, or rather default mode‐positive ICN features, compared to the first CAP. \n\nBoth DMN‐positive and DMN‐negative (or task‐positive) CAPs divide into subhierarchies and smaller CAPs (Figure  ), which are distinguished from each other by different areal average values (also referred to here as activation when above average and deactivation when below average) in ICA‐based RSNs (Figure  ). This is also depicted in the heatmap of Figure  , which illustrates the average   z  ‐score values of our study‐specific RSN parcellations in different CAPs. The hierarchical clustering of both rows and columns of this heatmap groups the different RSNs and CAPs by their features, respectively. This kind of review is modest in terms of spatial accuracy but facilitates pattern recognition in group‐level activation differences. The most obvious patterns are reported in the following paragraphs. \n  \nMean voxel‐wise   z  ‐scores by resting state networks (as in Figure  ) for each CAP. On the   x   and   y   axes, the brain areas' grouping was determined by the hierarchical clustering (cosine distance, Ward's method) of only this particular   z  ‐score matrix. On the   x  ‐axis, the CAP label colors correspond to the \"DMN‐negative/task‐positive\" (blue labels, DMN‐CAPs) and \"DMN‐positive\" (red labels, DMN + CAPs) grouping of CAPs, with a thin black separating line between them. Network abbreviations: DAN = dorsal attention; Visual Med, Up Med, Lat = visual medial, upper medial, lateral; VAN‐P/‐A = ventral attention posterior/anterior; DMN‐V/‐D/‐A = default mode ventral/dorsal/anterior, FPC L/R = frontoparietal cognitive control left/right. Views: DAN, Visual (3D elevated occipital), Somatosensory, Motor, DMN‐A (3D above), Auditory, Salience, VAN, FPC R (3D right lateral), DMN‐V, ‐D (axial slice above), DMN/Language, FPC L (3D left lateral) \n  \nWhen the CAPs in Figure   are transformed into the heatmap of Figure  , one can roughly detect four panels. Firstly, the DMN, language, and FPC networks exhibit mainly negative   z  ‐scores (interpreted here as network deactivation) during the default mode‐negative CAPs (DMN‐CAPs) and form the bluish colored lower panel on the left, whereas the DAN and all the sensory, motor, salience, and VAN networks mostly exhibit red colored positive   z  ‐scores (interpreted here as task‐positive network activation) and form the reddish left upper panel of the DMN‐CAPs. \n\nBut during the DMN‐positive CAPs (DMN + CAPs) on the right, the DMN, language, and FPC networks largely exhibit positive   z  ‐scores and form the reddish right lower panel. Fourthly, the right upper panel of the DMN + CAPs consist for the most part, of blue colored negative   z  ‐scores, excluding a few CAPs with activation among auditory, visual, salience, and VAN networks. \n\nDue to   z  ‐score averaging, the nuances of the CAPs are lost in the heatmap, and a few seemingly similar CAPs coexist on both left and right. Notably, some CAPs also show only activation or deactivation over all the RSNs, that is, negative blue or positive red vertical stripes over the whole brain cortex matrix (Figures   and  ). \n  \nCombination of Figures   and  . Largest clusters (highest decile) of TD and ASD group‐related CAP activity in resting state networks. (a) The TD group‐related activity is marked by the letter \"T\" and (b) the ASD group‐related activity by \"A\" over the color‐coded average   z  ‐scores of the same heatmap as those in Figure  \n  \nThe areas in the CAPs in which the TD or ASD group have significantly greater activation than the other group are shown as a percentage of the corresponding RSN volume in Figure  . The highlighted highest deciles of these results are projected on the earlier CAP heatmap (Figure  ). This combination in Figure   enables finding the RSNs in the CAPs that exhibit the largest simultaneous group‐related activations. The twenty largest between‐group differences in CAPs are listed in Table  . Additional descriptive (Figures  a‐b, Figures  a‐i) and detailed results Table   can be found in Appendix   of this article and in Zenodo (Paakki et al.,  ), respectively. \n  \nPercentages of brain areas in CAPs in which the (a) TD and (b) ASD groups have significantly greater voxel‐wise   z  ‐score values than the other group. The results are shown at q = .05 false discovery rate (FDR) corrected. An arbitrary threshold of the highest decile is applied to the cell background coloring (blue rectangles for TD, red for ASD) as a highlighting method, in which cluster areas comprise at least 19% of the corresponding IC areas. The order and origin of the   x  ‐ and   y  ‐axis labels are identical to those in Figure  \n    \nTwenty biggest CAP group differences in FSL randomise TFCE clusters (false discovery rate q < 0.05 corrected, two‐tailed FDR‐adjusted   p  ‐value threshold   p   =.002) and percentage of brain areas in each CAP and IC in which the ASD or TD groups had significantly greater values than the other group \n  \nWhen inspecting Figure   through the four‐panel approach described earlier, one can see that most of the largest TD group‐related activations fall within the task‐related networks in the upper left panel during the DMN‐CAPs. In contrast, during the DMN + CAPs, the TD group‐related activations are mostly within the DMN and the language and VAN networks. \n\nThe TD group‐related FPC activation was left‐dominant during the DMN‐CAPs and right‐dominant during the DMN + CAPs. The left FPC was activated, while the task‐related networks were also activated and seemed to associate with the salience and VAN‐A networks in particular, but also with the auditory, somatosensory, and DAN networks. Right FPC activation associated with the DMN and language networks. \n\nThe earlier described four‐panel approach generally showed more incoherently highlighted patterns during the ASD group‐related activations than the TD group‐related activations (Figures   and  ). The ASD group's FPC activations did not demonstrate clear‐cut sidedness related to the DMN‐negative or DMN‐positive CAPs. However, there were some repeating overactivation patterns. The DAN associated with the visual networks. If the visual network was overactive but not concurrent with the DAN, it associated in turn with the DMN. In the TD group, the DAN overactivation was also associated with other task‐positive networks in a more balanced way. It also seems that the ASD group did not quite reach as strong deactivations as the TD group (Figure  ). ASD group‐related overactivations were found especially in the DAN, visual and auditory networks, and the DMN. In the 06–06 CAP, which deactivated all 14 RSNs, the ASD group showed a considerably reduced deactivation pattern in nearly all (12/14) of the RSNs. \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \n### Study results and comparison to earlier studies \n  \nOur study provides complementary information and an alternative perspective to FC analysis by gathering nonsequentially brief instances of similar fMRI brain volumes into larger CAP clusters. This method may be especially beneficial before group comparisons in RS studies, in which no external synchronization is provided by tasks or stimuli. We found the DMN + CAPs and DMN‐CAPs (61% and 39% of the fMRI volumes, respectively) to be spatially similar in both TD and ASD groups as the clustering algorithm gathered volumes to each CAP from both groups without significant group‐wise differences in time spent in each CAP. However, the CAPs showed focused alterations of internal activity levels among many RSNs, including the following (Figures   and  ): \n\n1) ASD‐related activations during the DMN‐CAPs considerably affected the DMN, and during DMN + CAPs, other RSNs. \n\n2) The ASD group showed visual network overactivation during the DMN‐CAPs, which was simultaneous with the overactivation of either the DAN or the DMN. \n\n3) Autism spectrum disorder‐related FPC activations were incoherent and showed hemispherical shifts. \n\n4) The auditory, DMN, and language networks were overactivated in the ASD group during the RSN deactivations, which may indicate higher baseline activity in the ASD group. \n\nThe TD group‐related alterations can be assessed similarly: In general, the TD group showed greater activation in the task‐positive RSNs during the DMN‐CAPs and in the positively activated DMN during the DMN + CAPs, than the ASD group. During the DMN‐CAPs, auditory activation reached higher levels in the TD group. In addition, DAN activation was also more evenly related to other sensory (auditory, somatosensory), salience, and VAN networks. FPC overactivation was consistently asymmetric in the TD group: predominantly left‐sided during the DMN‐CAPs and right‐sided during the DMN + CAPs. \n\nComparing the group‐related changes in Figure   shows that the ASD participants demonstrated overactivation of visual medial areas during the DMN‐CAPs. Simultaneous overactivation with a visual network was detected among the DAN and/or DMN. This tendency might have been related to increased reliance on posterior brain areas in ASD when mediating visuospatial tasks (Kana et al.,  ). In a recent magnetoencephalography study, the ASD group presented early enhanced activity in the occipital region, suggesting that impaired face processing in ASD might be sustained by atypical responses in primary visual areas (Kovarski et al.,  ). Anecdotal experiences of individuals with ASD report overwhelming sensations of visual details in everyday environments that they cannot pass without becoming absorbed in them. Abnormal simultaneous overactivation of the visual networks with the DAN and the DMNs detected in our study could reflect such propensity. \n\nPeople with ASD experience trouble filtering torrents of information, which hijacks their concentration, and this may explain why prolonged simultaneous multisensory events cause fatigue sooner for people with ASD. On the other hand, it could be speculated that neurotypical people may not be able to concentrate with similar intensity or for equal periods under normal levels of stimuli. It would be interesting to study further whether the neurobiological potential for concentration in ASD could be reflected in task‐related DMN activation. Such a study could utilize the gradual‐onset continuous performance task (gradCPT). The gradCPT is a sustained attention ability paradigm that has been validated behaviorally and recently with neuroimaging (Fortenbaugh et al.,  ). The gradCPT results show that fluctuations in attentional stability are tracked over time in task‐positive (e.g., DAN and VAN) and task‐negative (e.g., DMN) regions and vary in specific ways before attention lapses or concerning reaction time and performance. The DMN contributions are not unambiguous but also modulated, for example, by motivation (Fortenbaugh et al.,  ). We are not aware of ASD‐related studies utilizing gradCPT and fMRI. \n\nIn healthy adults, a network graph study found that optimal sustained attention arose from reduced network cross talk and greater within‐network communication in task‐relevant networks such as salience, cingulo‐opercular, dorsal attention, and visual (Zuberer et al.,  ). In contrast, optimal attention predicted greater network cross talk and reduced within‐network communication in auditory and sensorimotor networks and lower within‐network communication in the subcortical and ventral attention networks (Zuberer et al.,  ). The relationship between network graphs and brain (de)activations needs clarification. \n\nConcentration or sustained attention and mind‐wandering or task‐unrelated thoughts are two general mind states alternating with varying frequency and duration during some task. In a study by Scheibner et al. ( ), mindful attention was characterized by less activity in the DMN than mind‐wandering, independent of attention type (internal breathing or external sound). The activation difference was greater in the inner attention meditation than in the external attention meditation. While the ability to concentrate or uphold sustained attention is not equal to mindfulness, these concepts are related, and mindfulness‐based interventions can increase attention (Trautwein et al.,  ). These transient cognitive states may be captured better in dynamical temporal analysis than static methods. Marusak et al. ( ) showed that trait mindfulness in youths related to dynamic but not static RS connectivity. The more mindful youths transitioned more between brain states, spent less time in a particular connectivity state, and showed a state‐specific reduction in connectivity between salience and central executive (i.e., frontoparietal cognitive control) networks (Marusak et al.,  ). In our study, the strongest salience and FPC mean activations were detected during DMN + CAPs (Figure  ). We found TD group‐related salience and FPC L association during the DMN‐CAPs, but during the DMN + CAPs, similar activity was seen in two ASD‐related CAPs only (Figures   and  ). The inferences between FC and CAP analysis are not yet clear. \n\nAs stated earlier, in the ASD group, during the DAN activated task‐positive CAPs (24–21, 13–11, 11–01, 10–01, 04–01, and 02–01, Appendix  : Figures  a‐i), there was a repeated association with ASD‐related overactivation of the visual medial network (Figure  ). Parallel top‐down volitional attention is influenced by the DAN, which has key nodes in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus, superior parietal lobule, and frontal eye fields (Vossel et al.,  ; Yamasaki et al.,  ). Research has demonstrated that these dorsal frontoparietal areas can causally modulate visual areas' activity (Vossel et al.,  ). One hypothetical explanation for our study results could be that this modulating effect may be more substantial among ASD individuals. However, we detected visual overactivation during many DMN‐CAPs, and the CAP method used here cannot infer causality. Yamasaki et al. ( ) reviewed studies using visual evoked potentials, event‐related potentials, and the diffusion tensor MRI of visual and attention networks in ASD. They found that (1) enhanced and impaired processing coexists within the lower visual area (V1), (2) local information integration from lower visual areas (V1) is impaired in higher‐level visual areas after V4 and V5/MT, and (3) the DAN is impaired, while the VAN is intact in ASD. The VAN contains key nodes in the temporoparietal junction and ventral frontal cortices related to automatically produced and quicker bottom‐up attention (Yamasaki et al.,  ). Despite the results of Yamasaki et al. ( ), some fMRI studies have found ASD‐related abnormalities in the VAN as well (Bernas et al.,  ; Farrant & Uddin,  ; Fitzgerald et al.,  ). \n\nMoreover, a study by Feczko et al. ( ) hints that some ASD subgroups have altered visual processing or attention mechanisms or both. In addition to overwhelming sensory experiences, altered connectivity of visual and attention networks may contribute to the impaired social communication in ASD. Early disordered FC involving the visual network may engender later disruptions in higher order behaviors. McKinnon et al. ( ) showed that aberrant functional connectivities between the visual, control, DMN, DAN, and subcortical networks are also associated with certain restricted and repetitive behaviors among children with ASD at 12 and 24 months of age. Other recent findings regarding abnormal attention mechanisms in ASD have been made in studies by Bi et al. ( ), Fitzgerald et al. ( ), and Gabrielsen et al. ( ). While ASD may offer advantages in various visual‐attentional tasks, the predisposition to intense attentional focus may come at the cost of resistance to task disengagement and other behavioral symptoms such as overfocusing and restricted interests (Kaldy et al.,  ). \n\nIn the TD group, highlighted simultaneous DAN and visual network overactivation were detected only during task‐positive CAP 06–03 and DMN‐positive CAP 03–03. The former, unlike the CAPs mentioned in the previous paragraph, exhibits mainly motor and somatosensory activation. In addition to the DAN and visual medial networks, TD group‐related overactivation is more comprehensive and detected among the auditory, salience and VAN, and FPC networks. \n\nA recent study showed that tactile and auditory hypersensitivity among children raised the risk of ASD diagnosis 34‐ and 22‐fold, respectively (Jussila et al.,  ). Our results suggest higher auditory network baseline activity during deactivations in ASD and that somatosensory activations are less unambiguous. Despite hearing protection, noisy MRI environments may cause more auditory than somatosensory input in a supine patient lying still. \n\nAutism spectrum disorder‐related functional brain asymmetry has been detected during RS by, for example, Cardinale et al. ( ) and Subbaraju et al. ( ), who have shown rightward asymmetry shifts of functional networks and atypical hemispherical lateralization, respectively. Diffusion imaging has found inversion or diminishing of typical left‐right asymmetry among ASD individuals (Carper et al.,  ; Conti et al.,  ; Wei et al.,  ). In a similar vein, our study demonstrated ASD group‐related FPC activation shifts that were rightward during the DMN‐CAPs and leftward during the DMN + CAPs (Figure  ). \n\nEarlier evidence of reduced functional integration of the DMN, especially weaker coherence of connectivity between the posterior and anterior subsystems (Joshi et al.,  ; Starck et al.,  ), may be mirrored in our study as higher baseline activity during the DMN‐CAPs, especially in the dorsal and ventral components of DMN. Still, the inferences between FC and CAP analysis remain unclear. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nResting state studies have found it difficult to show unambiguous brain FC changes in ASD (Hull et al.,  ). Even though local (e.g., regional homogeneity) and more distant changes of FC have been shown (Hull et al.,  ; Jao Keehn et al.,  ; Nair et al.,  ), legitimate concern has arisen that motion during RS examinations might at least partly explain the detected hypo‐ and/or hyperconnectivity (Jo et al.,  ; Power et al.,  ). Recent evidence suggests that censoring and ICA‐AROMA perform well across most preprocessing quality benchmarks (Parkes et al.,  ). Whereas earlier dual‐regression ICA and FC analysis has revealed only hypoconnectivity within the DMN subnetworks of our study participants with ASD (Starck et al.,  ), we found significant differences in many CAPs. When similarly activated brain BOLD fMRI volumes are accumulated into CAPs, between‐group comparisons may become more powerful than, for example, sliding window methods, in which each \"window\" of sequential volumes includes more heterogeneous brain activation patterns. When discussing results, one should remember that hierarchical clusters are nested and thus volumes accumulate as we move up the hierarchy into lower‐numbered cluster levels. Depending on the different spatial (de)activation signal amplitudes of the clusters (CAPs) combined and the difference in the brain areas' activation behavior between the groups, some of the spatial between‐group differences may fade, and others may increase from one hierarchical level to another. \n\nIt should be remembered that hierarchical clustering is an exploratory method and imposes a hierarchical structure regardless of whether such exists in the data (Friedman et al.,  ). Accordingly, the results should be interpreted cautiously. However, based on both previous research knowledge about alternating rest and task states of brain function and our results, this method can yield meaningful complementary information on the \"natural\" occurrence of CAPs and their relations to each other during RS‐fMRI. The coarse division in our data showed that 61% of the volumes had default mode‐positive RSN features. RS data certainly also include varying epochs with true task‐positive ICN activations, as the MRI environment is noisy and disruptive, especially to young individuals, and we imaged RS with the participants' eyes open. Empirical evidence suggests that eyes‐open brain states are better controlled than eyes‐closed states, but that eye status affects local connectivity, highlighting overconnectivity in posterior, visual regions and underconnectivity in the cingulate gyrus (Nair et al.,  ). We did not compare RS with task data, and the relationship between the CAPs of the rest and task data should be addressed in the future to determine the proportions of DMN‐positive and task‐positive activity in combined data and the various settings: or to determine whether certain CAPs and their between‐group differences persist during tasks and how they are modified. In this context, there is suggestive evidence that functional hierarchies in the pediatric brain are stable and similar during rest and task (Harrewijn et al.,  ). \n\nAs stated earlier, due to   z  ‐score averaging, the nuances of CAPs are lost in the heatmap, and a few seemingly similar CAPs coexist on both DMN‐negative and DMN‐positive sides of the clustering results. The clustering procedure itself is, of course, unaware of this interpretive naming convention and simplification aimed to facilitate the understanding of complex network interactions. In addition to averaging, the weaknesses of the chosen method may predispose to this phenomenon. \n\nThere are several linkage methods in hierarchical clustering. We chose Ward's method as it shares a common principle with k‐means, providing a basis for current research and comparison to earlier research. We found a high correlation with the CAPs from Liu et al. ( ) using the fslcc tool (results not shown), though their results were acquired after global mean removal. Using GSR could eliminate artifacts even more efficiently than censoring and ICA‐AROMA alone (Byrge & Kennedy,  ; Ciric et al.,  ; Murphy & Fox,  ; Power et al.,  ). Possible anticorrelations in the CAPs might not be as problematic as with FC measures, as signal amplitudes are compared. Our educated guess is that using GSR would reduce the portion of CAPs that exhibit whole brain‐wide activation or deactivation. Unfortunately, censoring reduces degrees of freedom and may also remove the signal of interest from the data. For example, Syed et al. ( ) found that although the DMN provided the highest discriminability between the control and ASD groups, the motor network regions with midcingulate cortex and temporal‐parietal junction were also discriminatory. Moreover, the choice of clustering distance measure (cosine, Euclidean, Pearson correlation, etc.) may potentially increase or decrease GSR‐like effects. \n\nBesides distance and linkage adjustments, combining other statistical procedures such as permutational methods to hierarchical clustering could achieve results closer to the ground truth. Based on our study, however, efforts to refine volume‐wise methods are worth pursuing. Hierarchical and k‐means are only two common, older clustering methods, and more efficient algorithms that can utilize fMRI‐specific data features probably exist. For example, random forest methods could be used in a volume‐wise fashion instead of measures from temporally stationary FC (Feczko et al.,  ; Fernández‐Delgado et al.,  ). Though FC and ICA RS metrics are not substantially affected by different TRs, faster imaging methods such as MREG with 10–20 Hz temporal resolution show \"neural avalanches,\" which in traditional 0.5–1 Hz fMRI temporal resolutions are only seen as aliased images and could enable the study of higher cluster numbers and shorter CAPs (Huotari et al.,  ; Rajna et al.,  ), though the inherently slow hemodynamic response function may act as a limiting bottleneck (Bolton et al.,  ). Faster imaging and dynamic lag analysis (Kotila et al.,  ; Raatikainen et al.,  ) or causality analysis methods (Bernas et al.,  ; Bielczyk et al.,  ; Borchers et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ; Deshpande & Hu,  ; Kaminski et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ) may shed light on interactions between attention, visual, and other brain networks. MREG fMRI coupled with simultaneous EEG analysis (Hiltunen et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Ridley et al.,  ) could clarify the relationship between the neural avalanches and the brain's electrical activity in the future. \n\nAs each volume is a time point in the imaging time series and is assigned with cluster membership, this method could map the changes at the individual level. The current study could be extended using a network or Markov chain analysis to determine whether there are repetitive sequences or states in the occurrence of the CAPs (Chen et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ; Zhuang et al.,  ), as some ASD studies indicate (Malaia et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). \n\nEven if independent RSNs seemed to activate normally, CAP analysis might reveal aberrant in‐between network interactions and their timing. FC analysis could be supplemented by CAP analysis. It may find CAPs that exhibit the greatest differences between the voxels with aberrant connectivity and may pinpoint the moments at which the differences lie and detect simultaneous patterns in other intrinsic networks and their activity levels. This knowledge may help find new approaches to ASD rehabilitation: for example, using customized stimuli targeting brain network combinations that have been found to have abnormal interactions or appropriate timing in interaction situations. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nThe present study describes one relatively simple method for comparing CAPs between study populations, but because a myriad of network combinations are possible and the signal amplitude in each network varies greatly, developing a method that could satisfyingly capture the whole dynamics of brain networks is still a never‐ending challenge. Based on our study experiences, we encourage the development of volume‐wise approaches as an option to further characterize the TVFC changes in brain networks. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n\n### PEER REVIEW \n  \nThe peer review history for this article is available at  . \n\n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"66eaa7e07ed618f436273034079a84ed"},

Quantifying the task‐modulated variability in dynamic functional connectivity at cue exposure can aid the understanding. We analyzed changes in dynamic connectivity in 54 adult cannabis users and 90 controls during a cannabis cue exposure task. The variability was measured as standard deviation in the (a) connectivity weights of the default mode, the central executive, and the salience networks and two reward loci (amygdalae and nuclei accumbens); and (b) topological indexes of the whole brain (global efficiency, modularity and network resilience). These were compared for the main effects of task conditions and the group (users vs. controls), and correlated with pre‐ and during‐scan subjective craving. The variability of connectivity weights between the central executive network and nuclei accumbens was increased in users throughout the cue exposure task, and, was positively correlated with during‐scan craving for cannabis. The variability of modularity was not different by groups, but positively correlated with prescan craving. The variability of dynamic connectivity during cannabis cue exposure task between the central executive network and the nuclei accumbens, and, the level of modularity, seem to relate to the neural underpinning of cannabis use and the subjective craving. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nCraving is a hallmark behavioral problem in substance use disorders (SUDs) that contributes toward loss of control over substance use and drug relapse. One of its well‐known neural correlates is the reward‐related prefrontal‐limbic pathway, but the large‐scale intrinsic networks are also crucially involved (Filbey, Gohel, Prashad, & Biswal,  ; Zilverstand, Huang, Alia‐Klein, & Goldstein,  ). Some of those networks are the default mode (DMN), the central executive (CEN), and the salience networks (SN). The DMN, or self‐oriented network, relates to attention toward internal information (Raichle,  ). Its activity correlates with the subjective craving, and seems to show reduced functional interactions with the other brain networks in SUDs (Zhang & Volkow,  ). The CEN, or goal‐oriented network, relates to executive and inhibitory controls that drive attention on external objectives, and control impulsivity (Chen et al.,  ; Sridharan, Levitin, & Menon,  ), functions that are often compromised in SUDs (Dalley & Robbins,  ; Luijten et al.,  ). The SN is implicated in allocating functional resources between the DMN and CEN based on the salience of information (Menon & Uddin,  ; Seeley et al.,  ; Sridharan et al.,  ). Its dysfunction potentially affects the attentional attribution to external information, which relates to an imbalance of attention to drug versus nondrug cues (R. Z. Goldstein & Volkow,  ; Naqvi & Bechara,  ; Sutherland, McHugh, Pariyadath, & Stein,  ). \n\nThe functional underpinning of bias toward drug‐related information have been found in subcortical regions in prefrontal‐limbic pathway (Filbey & Dunlop,  ), such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala (Swanson,  ). Both nucleus accumbens and amygdala receive dopamine (DA) inputs within the mesocorticolimbic pathway, and are important in acquiring motor behavior under conditioning toward drug cues (Pert, Post, & Weiss,  ). Specifically, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), also referred to as ventral striatum, plays a key role in appraising the subjective value of reward (Milton & Everitt,  ) toward reward‐motivated decision making (Cools,  ). The amygdala (Amyg) seems to appraise the emotional relevance of external information related to reward (Baxter & Murray,  ; Cunningham & Brosch,  ). The DA system can influence the functional connectivity in DMN, CEN, SN (Cole, Oei, et al.,  ) as well as NAcc and Amyg, which may also be associated with the reduced inhibitory control and biased salience attribution found in SUDs (R. Z. Goldstein & Volkow,  ; Zilverstand et al.,  ). \n\nMost of the previous studies on the task‐modulated functional connectivity (FC) during cue‐induced craving applied static approaches, which do not take the variability of FC over time into account. One of the most widely utilized methods for analyzing task‐modulated static FC is psychophysiological interaction (PPI; Friston et al.,  ; McLaren, Ries, Xu, & Johnson,  ), which evaluates the correlations of task‐modulated blood‐oxygen‐level‐dependent (BOLD) response of one upon the other regions across the entire observation time. However, high‐frequency phasic activity of DA neurons in response to drug cues (Koob & Volkow,  ) may manifest temporal fluctuations in FC. The variability can be quantified using dynamic FC, which reflects time‐dependent changes of FC by subdividing the entire observation into smaller sections instead of across all frames within the observation time (Allen et al.,  ; Chang & Glover,  ; Preti, Bolton, & van de Ville,  ; Sakoglu et al.,  ; Sakoglu & Calhoun,  ,  ; Sakoglu, Michael, & Calhoun,  ). FC of the brain and its topological properties are inherently nonstationary (the connectivity mean and variability are not constant over observation time) depending on the given tasks (Braun et al.,  ; Fong et al.,  ; Gonzalez‐Castillo & Bandettini,  ) and also during the resting state (Allen et al.,  ; Chang & Glover,  ; de Pasquale, Della Penna, Sporns, Romani, & Corbetta,  ; Preti et al.,  ). Dynamic FC can capture the time‐dependent changes that relate to temporally dynamic processes, for example, phasic neural firing of DA neurons. \n\nDynamic conditional correlation (DCC) quantifies the temporally sensitive alterations in functional coherence across brain regions per frame (Engle,  ; Lindquist, Xu, Nebel, & Caffo,  ). Based on framewise changes in FC, DCC can account for model‐free, momentary FC changes in a specific task condition, therefore expanding from the model‐based estimation of FC via generalized PPI. By temporally weighting the DCC by task conditions, we can obtain the series of dynamic FC when a task condition was in effect and the task‐modulated variability of dynamic FC in standard deviation (  SD  ). \n\nPrevious studies on the alterations of dynamic FC related to substance use are sparse. Vergara, Weiland, Hutchison, and Calhoun ( ) combined large number of users dependent on various kinds of substances and found that the dwelling times of specific functional states represented by dynamic FC patterns differ significantly across user groups of substances including cannabis. Focusing on cannabis use, Zaytseva et al. ( ) found a specific dynamic FC pattern that shows higher connectivity within and between auditory and somatomotor cortices, which appears during acute delta‐9‐tetrahydrocannabiol (THC) intoxication in occasional users. Sakoglu et al. ( ) is one of the earlier examples that compared dynamic FC patterns using independent component analysis during motor response inhibition task. This study noted pairs of networks that differentiate cocaine users from the healthy controls, which include visual, sensorimotor, the DMN and the CEN. In sum, there is emerging literature demonstrating that dynamic FC is a sensitive marker for substance use and related behaviors. Dynamic FC may also clarify the functional states precipitated by drug‐related conditions. This study therefore aimed to explore this possibility, by quantifying the dynamic FC changes directly relevant to the subjective craving, targeting the task‐modulated dynamic FC in the cannabis cue exposure task. \n\nThis paper investigated the dynamic FC during cannabis cue‐reactivity using DCC. We aimed to (a) identify a system‐level marker related to cue‐induced changes in the DMN, the CEN, and the SN, and Amyg and NAcc; (b) identify the difference in DCC‐derived dynamic FC measures across task conditions, and between cannabis users and controls; and (c) test whether these measures are associated with subjective craving. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nParticipants were recruited from a study of neural mechanisms related to cannabis craving described in Filbey et al. ( ) and Filbey et al. ( ). The study's inclusion criteria were right‐handedness, English as the primary language, the absence of either a current psychosis, history of psychosis, traumatic brain injury, or MRI contraindications (e.g., pregnancy, MR‐incompatible metallic implants, claustrophobia, etc.). The nonusing controls (CON) were recruited based on the absence of daily cannabis use at any period in their lifetime, as well as an absence of current illicit drug use in the past 60 days. Chronic cannabis users (CAN) were defined as those with self‐reported history of regular cannabis use resulting in a minimum of 5,000 separate lifetime occasions of use. An additional inclusion criterion for CAN was self‐reported daily cannabis use over the preceding 60 days as determined by the Timeline Followback Calendar (TLFB). All the participants were excluded if drugs other than cannabis were detected by a urinary toxicity test, unless it was a prescribed medication. Participants with significant levels of other substance use as indicated by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐IV criteria (First & Gibbon,  ) were excluded from the study. Given the high comorbidity of tobacco and cannabis use, we did not exclude participants with regular tobacco use. \n\nAll participants were asked to refrain from alcohol use for 24 hr, and caffeine and cigarettes for the 2 hr before the scheduled scan. In addition, cannabis using participants were asked to abstain from using cannabis for 72 hr. Those whose self‐report did not meet this requirement were excluded from the study. As a result, a total of 144 participants (90 controls in CON group, 54 users in CAN group) were included in the study. Demographic information is shown in Table  . \n  \nDemographics of CON and CAN groups \n    \n\n### Cannabis use measures \n  \nWe collected data related to age of first regular use, and the duration of regular use of cannabis using the Substance History Questionnaire (Sobell, Kwan, & Sobell,  ). Self‐reports of the last date of cannabis use before the scan date, and the level of cannabis intake were evaluated in grams per day. Urine THC (ng) over creatinine (ml) levels were measured via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. \n\n\n### Subjective craving measures \n  \nSubjective craving for cannabis was measured according to the following: (a) prescan/baseline subjective craving—assessed using the total score from the Marijuana Craving Questionnaire (Haughey, Marshall, Schacht, Louis, & Hutchison,  ) prior to the fMRI scan; (b) during‐scan/cue‐induced subjective craving—response on a 10‐point Likert scale following each trial of   cannabis   cue exposure in the fMRI (see details in task description below). Prescan, and the average of during‐scan scores were normalized using the mean and the   SD   of each within the CAN group (  n   = 52 for prescan craving, and   n   = 54 for during‐scan craving). \n\n\n###  MR   acquisition \n  \nAll the MRI images were collected using a 3T Philips whole body scanner with the Quasar gradient subsystem (40 mT/m amplitude, a slew rate of 220 mT/m/ms) at Advanced Imaging Research Center at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Structural T1 images were acquired in an MPRAGE sequence with the parameters: TR/TE = 8.1/3.7 ms, FA = 12 deg, voxel = 1 × 1 × 1 mm , matrix size in   x   and   y   directions = 256 × 256, and FOV = 256 × 256 mm . \n\nTask‐based functional MRI (fMRI) was collected using a gradient echo, echo‐planar sequence. Parameters were: 810 dynamic scans (27 min), TR/TE = 2000/29 ms, FA = 75 deg, voxel = 3.44 × 3.44 × 3.50 mm , matrix size in x and y directions = 64 × 64 mm , and FOV = 220 × 220 mm . \n\n\n### Cannabis cue exposure task \n  \nThis study used a cue exposure task originally described in Filbey et al. ( ), which was modified from Filbey, Schacht, Myers, Chavez, and Hutchison ( ). The task consisted of two consecutive sessions that are 13 min and 30 s long, each one with a pseudorandom order of visual and tactile presentations of (a) a single cannabis cue, (b) a single natural reward cue, and (c) a single neutral cue. Each type of cue was presented for 12 trials, and for a single trial a cue was shown for 20 s long. Right after exposure, the subjective craving was quantified by asking participants to respond to: “Please rate your urge to use marijuana right now.” Responses were measured using a scale from 0 (no urge at all) to 10 (the highest) for 5 s, and the scores were recorded using a fiber‐optic pad. Participants who showed abnormally high levels of craving, which means the average rating score of higher than nine for all cues; and low levels of craving, which means the average rating score of zero for cannabis cues, were excluded from this study. During‐scan craving referred to the average of 12 rated scores after   cannabis   cues were presented. \n\nCue stimuli given to the participants were based on their individual responses to “What is your preferred cannabis use method?” The answers were among a pipe, a bong, a blunt, and a joint. The same cues were randomly chosen for the controls. Natural reward cues were chosen as fruit (Filbey et al.,  ). Like the cannabis cues, we presented participants with their self‐selected fruit stimulus based on their responses to “what is your preferred fruit?” For both users and controls, the answers were among a banana, an apple, an orange, and grapes. Neutral cues were pencils for the participants in both groups. E‐Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Inc. E‐Prime 2.0. Retrieved from  ) was used to present cue and save the responses from the scanner. The timestamps of task responses were recorded in correspondence to the trigger pulses obtained from the scanner's magnet. Figure   illustrates the procedure of the cue exposure task. \n  \nIllustration of cue exposure task \n  \nIn the following sections, FC measures were calculated in correspondence to each of six task conditions in abbreviations. C1 and W1 will be representing the conditions where neutral cues were presented (C1, meaning neutral cue ON state) and removed (W1, neutral cue OFF). C2 and W2 will be for natural reward cues (C2, natural reward cue ON and W2, natural reward cue OFF). C3 and W3 will be for cannabis cues (C3, cannabis cue ON and W3, cannabis cue OFF). The rated scores on the craving for cannabis cues in users’ group were used for further analyses. The subjective craving score was rated in both groups, but the post hoc analyses relating craving to FC measures were performed in users’ group only. \n\n\n###  FMRI   preprocessing \n  \nThe preprocessing for fMRI was performed using the combination of fMRIPrep 1.2.5 (Esteban et al.,  ) that utilizes Nipype 1.1.6 and Nilearn 0.5.0 ( ; K. Gorgolewski et al.,  ; K. J. Gorgolewski et al.,  ; Pedregosa et al.,  ), and CONN (Whitfield‐Gabrieli & Nieto‐Castanon,  ). Basic preprocessing including framewise motion correction, extraction of motion‐related and physiological noise components, and, intermodal normalization of T1 and fMRI images onto the standard MNI space was performed using fMRIPrep. The pipeline of fMRIPrep utilized toolboxes from FMRIB Software Library (Jenkinson, Beckmann, Behrens, Woolrich, & Smith,  ), FreeSurfer (Dale, Fischl, & Sereno,  ; Fischl, Sereno, & Dale,  ) and Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs; Avants, Tustison, & Song,  ). Further denoising of fMRI images using motion and physiological components, and, the integration of the fMRI images with the time series of the cue task were processed within a CONN pipeline. \n\nThe following descriptions on the preprocessing pipeline are adopted and revised from the fMRIPrep pipeline. A reference volume of an fMRI image was selected and brain‐extracted, then was linearly coregistered with nine degrees of freedom to the T1 images using BBRegister (FreeSurfer) that implements boundary‐based registration (Esteban et al.,  ; Greve & Fischl,  ). Head motion across time per subject was estimated using MCFLIRT in FSL (Jenkinson, Bannister, Brady, & Smith,  ), then the fMRI images were resampled to surfaces on fsaverage5 from FreeSurfer. The slice‐timing correction was applied, and the fMRI images were resampled back to the native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head‐motion and susceptibility distortions. Volumetric resamplings were performed using ANTs (Avants et al.,  ), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels (Lanczos,  ), and surface resamplings were performed using FreeSurfer. The images were normalized to nonlinear and asymmetric MNI152 2009c standard space. Several confounding regressors were calculated, including framewise displacement, global signal, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid signals (Power et al.,  ). \n\nFurther denoising was applied upon motion‐corrected and normalized fMRI images using motion‐related and physiological noise parameters estimated in the preliminary steps. A total of 36 confounding regressors, 24 of which are related to motion and 12 to physiological signals were linearly regressed out (Satterthwaite et al.,  ). For motion‐related regressors, first six were mean‐centered rotation and transition, second six were their mean‐centered derivatives, third six were their mean‐centered squared terms, and fourth six were their derivatives’ mean‐centered squared terms. For physiological signals, the same scheme was applied for three original signals, which were defined in global, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid regions. The outlier timeframes that show exceptionally higher framewise displacement (larger than 0.5 mm) were linearly regressed out using binary vectors that label the bad frames (Power et al.,  ). Finally, the effects of cue exposure (C1, C2, C3), washout (W1, W2, W3) and subjective craving rating for each cue type (neutral, natural reward, cannabis cues) were linearly regressed out for each individual fMRI images, by accounting for the mean‐centered time series of the task convolved with canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and its derivative. Thus, a total of 18 (from three task conditions that are cue ON, cue OFF and rate, for three cue types, and both the original time series and its derivative = 3 × 3 × 2) regressors were additionally considered as noise components simultaneously with the other nuisance covariates. Rating (five‐second long) was not included in the assessment of task‐modulated connectivity, but its time series was used as a nuisance covariate. During the denoising step, the bandpass filtering was applied simultaneously with the other noise components, at low 0.01 to high 0.25 Hz. \n\n\n### Definition of brain regions and connections \n  \nFC was based on the cortical regions defined in the Gordon 333 atlas (Gordon et al.,  ), and 14 subcortical regions from Harvard‐Oxford atlas (Desikan et al.,  ; Frazier et al.,  ; J. M. Goldstein et al.,  ; Makris et al.,  ). Among a total 347 regions, 41 regions were in the default mode network (DMN), 24 regions in the central executive network (CEN), and 44 regions in the salience network (SN) that is labeled as either salience or cingulo‐opercular network (S. Sadaghiani & D'Esposito,  ; Seeley et al.,  ) in the Gordon atlas. These three intrinsic networks of interest were accounted for the FC, as illustrated in Figure  . In addition, this study considered two subcortical regions known to be important in SUDs: bilateral amygdalae (Amyg) and nuclei accumbens (NAcc). \n\nA total of 12 functional connections were calculated using the time series per cortical region defined for each network, and subcortical regions of amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Specifically, these included (a) connections   within   each network that involve a pair of two regions from the same network (WithinDMN, WithinCEN, WithinSN); (b) connections   between   two networks that involve a pair of two regions from different networks (DMN–CEN, DMN–SN, CEN–SN); (c) connections between left and right amygdalae (Amyg) and each of three intrinsic networks (Amyg‐DMN, Amyg‐CEN, Amyg‐SN); and (4) connections between left and right nuclei accumbens (NAcc) and three networks (NAcc‐DMN, NAcc‐CEN, NAcc‐SN). Connection weights were averaged across all the pairs included per type of FC (e.g., for within the DMN, 41 × 40/2 = 820 connections’ weights were averaged) to represent each type of functional connectivity. \n\n\n### Dynamic functional connectivity via dynamic conditional correlation \n  \nDynamic FC is a derivative measure of the FC that takes temporally dynamic changes in connectivity into account. Its quantification can be performed by either segregating the time series of BOLD activity into multiple chunks of smaller windows as in sliding‐window, or tapered sliding‐window approach (Allen et al.,  ; Chang & Glover,  ; Sakoglu et al.,  ,  ; Sakoglu & Calhoun,  ,  ), or estimating instantaneous FC without the need of defining the criteria for subdividing time series as in instantaneous phase coherence, multiple temporal derivative, or dynamic conditional correlation approach (Glerean, Salmi, Lahnakoski, Jääskeläinen, & Sams,  ; Lindquist et al.,  ; Shine et al.,  ). \n\nThis study used dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) without moving average (Engle,  ; Lindquist et al.,  ), which is based on the multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model (Engle,  ) that can be effective for estimating nonstationary temporal associations when the model of time series is well‐known (Lebo & Box‐Steffensmeier,  ). We used the code implemented by Lindquist et al. ( ) shared in  , which ran on MATLAB R2018b utilizing 120 high‐performance computing SLURM nodes. It first performs estimation of conditional variance of the two brain regions’ time series accounting for each present timeframe (  t  ) and the past frames (  t   – 1,   t   – 2 … 1), then provides instantaneous DCC based on the variance values (Engle,  ; Lindquist et al.,  ). The performance of DCC in estimating the ground‐truth dynamic connectivity is higher than the most of the sliding‐window approaches, given that the underlying parametric model for estimating variance is feasible (Lindquist et al.,  ). In comparisons across multiple datasets, the test–retest reliability was also higher for the DCC method (Choe et al.,  ). Applying moving average after obtaining DCC can improve its correspondence to behaviorally meaningful information during tasks (Xie et al.,  ), with the penalty of losing part of the information within the window and especially, at the edge of the very first or last series of windows. Leonardi and van de Ville ( ) provided mathematically feasible range of window length for moving average (window length ≥ 1/  f  ), but this study used DCC without moving average to retain as much information as possible throughout the entire scan. The following DCC metrics were calculated as our measure of dynamic FC. \n\n#### Primary   DCC   measures: Functional connectivity weights \n  \nThe time series of DCC (347 ROIs × 347 ROIs × 810 frames) was calculated per individual. Correspondingly, the same 12 types of FC, which indicate the total average of weights within and between the three intrinsic networks (DMN, CEN, SN), and, between the three networks and two subcortical regions (NAcc and Amyg) were obtained for each frame. The connectivity weight of the dynamic FC defined per pair of different regions for each frame per task condition was considered as the primary measure. The dynamic FC weight is denoted as   w  (  i  ,   j  ,   t  ,   t  ) in Figure  , which conceptually illustrates how the measures were evaluated across the scan. The primary measure was weighted by HRF‐convolved time series that correspond to each task condition for evaluating task‐modulated effects in dynamic FC. \n  \nIllustration of primary and secondary dynamic functional connectivity measures defined per timeframe. The presentation is conceptual and not based on the actual data \n  \n\n#### Secondary   DCC   measures: Topological indexes \n  \nThe topological properties of dynamic FC were considered as the secondary measures as calculated by Brain Connectivity Toolbox (Rubinov & Sporns,  ). To quantify any topological properties, FC weights per timeframe were thresholded by setting originally negative values to zero, therefore resulting in only having non‐negative connectivity weights. In the topological indexes of connectivity, brain regions were referred to as   nodes  , and functional link between two of them as   edges  . Values of interest were network global efficiency (  G  ), deterministic modularity (  G  ) and topological resilience (  G  ) that quantifies the reduction of network efficiency caused by removing high‐importance edges. Conceptually, global efficiency represents the degree of functional integration of the organization, and modularity that of segregation. Network resilience is in the trade‐off relationship with the efficiency of the network (Brede & de Vries,  ; Netotea & Pongor,  ). \n\nGlobal efficiency of a network is a representative measure of how the information transfer is relatively easier across two topological locations (Latora & Marchiori,  ). This metric is calculated as the summed reciprocals of the topological distance a node requires to connect itself to the other nodes within the network (Rubinov & Sporns,  ), and a higher value indicates more efficient information transfer. \n\nDeterministic modularity of a network is a representative measure of community structure of the network topology, which describes the density of connections between nodes inside each clusters that are sparsely linked to each other (Newman,  ). This metric is calculated by quantifying the proportion of edges that connect nodes within each topologically divided clusters over those connect between the other clusters (Rubinov & Sporns,  ). A higher value indicates more modular topology, or an organization that shows distinctly separated communities of nodes (Newman,  ; Reichardt & Bornholdt,  ). \n\nTopological resilience is defined as a proxy measure of how much functional degradation a network structure can handle as described by Alstott, Breakspear, Hagmann, Cammoun, and Sporns ( ). The degradation in a network is conceptually modeled as the removal of an edge or edges, by setting the connectivity weight of the targeted edges and their transposed locations in the connectivity matrix to zero. Referring to Netotea and Pongor ( ), this paper quantified resilience (  G  ) as the magnitude of change in global efficiency (  E   –   E  ) over the number of edges removed (  N  ), multiplied by the total number of edges in the network (  N   = 347 × 346/2 = 60,031 edges). In Equation  ), the 100% refers to the state of the connectivity matrix after removing all the targeted edges, and 0% the original state. The resilience is always negative, and higher values indicate more resilient structures.   N   is equal to zero, thus not shown in the formula. \n\nAccording to Crossley et al. ( ), damage afflicted by many known brain disorders seem to center around the topologically most important nodes in the brain network. The number of shortest paths between any pair of nodes in the network that pass through a given edge is represented by a measure called edge betweenness centrality, and this measure represents that the edge is topologically more important for connecting nodes across the network efficiently (Freeman,  ). Thus, edges with higher betweenness centrality are, by definition, likely to connect a functional hub with the other nodes. In this study, we simulated functional degradations in the brain network by removing all edges (100%) with the betweenness centrality values higher than one, leaving only the edges that have betweenness centrality values of either 0 (no shortest paths pass) or 1 (only one shortest path passes) in the original structure. Each topological index was weighted by HRF‐convolved task time series. The calculation of secondary measures was done on 120 high‐performance computing SLURM nodes with MATLAB R2018b. \n\n\n\n### Task‐modulated standard deviation of dynamic functional connectivity \n  \nPrimary and secondary measures were quantified based on the connectivity matrix weighted by HRF‐convolved time series of task conditions (C1, W1, C2, W2, C3, and W3). The task‐modulated variability across time was the representative measure of this study, which was quantified by the   SD   (  d  ) of dynamic FC. Equation  ) shows how   d   of primary measures were calculated based on dynamic FC weighted by time series of task (  H  ), defined as the blocks of task convolved with canonical HRF   not   centered to zero mean. \n\nFor the time series of the task and connectivity,   t   = {1 …   T  } defines the temporal length in timeframes of one task trial (one of C1, W1, C2, W2, C3, or W3), and   T   is defined by the number of nonzero positive values within one trial window from   H  ;   t   = {1 …   T  } represents the number of trials per task condition, which was set to 12 for all task conditions. The dynamic connectivity between region   i   and   j   at a fixed time point is denoted as   w  (  i  ,   j  ,   t  ,   t  ). Calculations in inner bracket performs the weighting (multiplication) of each dynamic connection values in accordance to   H  , so that only the values that are relevant to task‐modulated BOLD activity are considered. The weighted connectivity is averaged across the number of connection pairs exist per type of connectivity (  N  ).   E  (  d  ) represents the mean of weighted dynamic connectivity values of one pair across timeframes within one trial. \n\nTask‐modulated   SD   aims to explore whether the nonstationary nature of the dynamic connectivity provides behavioral correlates of the task. The major difference of using dynamic FC compared to the generalized PPI (McLaren et al.,  ) is that it estimates the connectivity per pair of regions and per timeframe regarding the nonstationarity of the entire time series first (Lindquist et al.,  ), then calculates the task‐modulated connectivity weighted by task series, therefore eliminating the need of introducing a linear model of task‐based modulation that includes psychophysiological interactions. It is thus able to quantify the temporal variability of FC, which requires accounting for multiple timeframes within one trial of a task condition. Task‐modulated   SD   exploits the dynamic FC defined per timeframe to see if the task‐modulated magnitude of connectivity fluctuation can provide information on task‐modulated behavioral markers. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses and visualization \n  \nThe statistical tests used in this study were independent   t  ‐tests, repeated‐measures ANOVA, evaluation of sphericity in dependent variables using Mauchly's test, and nonparametric partial correlation (Spearman's rho, denoted as   R   for all figures). For repeated measures ANOVA, the statistical significance was determined from the results of multivariate analyses, then the main effect of task conditions within subjects for each dependent variable (FC measures) was evaluated using Greenhouse–Geisser's method with Bonferroni correction. The order of magnitude for each dependent variable across task conditions was also calculated using post hoc test with Bonferroni correction, and the order was represented as letter legends on figures. The main effect of group between subjects was further tested with post hoc Bonferroni correction for 12 connection weights for primary, and three topological indexes for secondary measures. Alpha level was defined at corrected   p   < .050 for all analyses. All the tests were performed using IBM SPSS (IBM Corp. Released 2016. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24.0. Armonk, NY). The three‐dimensional illustrations of brain changes were created using BrainNet viewer (Xia, Wang, & He,  ). All the plots representing statistical results were created using R (R Core Team,  ), with toolboxes of ggplot2 (Wickham,  ), gridextra (Auguie, Antonov, & Auguie,  ), and reshape2 (Wickham,  ). \n\nStatistical results for primary and secondary measures were presented as follows. For the primary measure, the   d   regarding intrinsic networks and subcortical regions of Amyg and NAcc were compared between CON and CAN groups for six task conditions (C1, W1, C2, W2, C3, and W3) within each subject. The effects of interest were the main effect of task (within‐subject), group (between‐subject), and the interaction of task and group (within‐between). In the repeated measures ANOVA, dependent variables were dynamic primary measures of 12 connectivity types. Thus, multiple comparison corrections were applied using Bonferroni's method for 12 cases. For the secondary measure, the   SD   of topological properties (  G  ,   G  , and   G  ) were analyzed as dependent variables affected by the same effects of interest. Multiple comparison corrections were applied using Bonferroni's method for three cases. Both models included age and the average framewise displacement across a total 810 dynamic timeframes (mean‐centered per group, CON and CAN) as nuisance covariates to account for the error variance. The main effect of age is known to significantly alter connectivity‐related measures (Ferreira et al.,  ), and considering average framewise displacement may reduce the potential effect of head motion upon the connectivity measures (Siegel et al.,  ). \n\nA post hoc correlation analysis between each dynamic connectivity measures and subjective craving within CAN was performed. Nonparametric partial correlation using Spearman's rho was performed for primary and secondary measures, correcting for the variance of age and average framewise displacement. Multiple comparison corrections were performed using false discovery rate (FDR) of 25% under a restriction that the raw   p   values are smaller than .050 (Benjamini & Hochberg,  ). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Group and task condition effects on dynamic functional connectivity \n  \n#### Primary measures: Functional connectivity weights \n  \nThere was a significant effect of task on   d  , showing   F  (60, 3,465) = 14.979,   p   < .001. After multiple comparison correction, task‐modulated differences were found to be significant for all connectivity types of interest. The group effect was significant on changes in   d  , with   F  (12, 129) = 2.050,   p   = .025. After Bonferroni correction for individual between‐subject effects, the   d   of NAcc‐CEN was found to be higher in CAN when averaged across task conditions, showing   F  (1, 140) = 8.502, uncorrected   p   = .0041, corrected   p   = .0496. The interaction of group and task effects was not significant, showing   F  (60, 3,465) = 1.204,   p   = .136.

The group effect was significant (  F  [3, 138] = 2.906,   p   = .037), but individual effects did not survive multiple correction (maximum   F  [1,140] = 4.584, minimum uncorrected   p   = .034, corrected   p   = .102 for   G  ). The interaction was not significant (  F  [15, 2,100] = 1.009,   p   = .442).

Our findings showed that (a) the variability of NAcc‐CEN connectivity weights was significantly higher in cannabis users than controls regardless of task conditions, (b) the variability within the CEN was positively correlated with prescan craving, (c) the variability of dynamic FC between NAcc and the two major intrinsic networks, the DMN and the CEN, was positively correlated with during‐scan craving, and (d) the variability of whole‐brain network modularity was positively correlated with prescan craving. Both pre‐ and during‐scan subjective craving ratings were associated with the system‐level changes in the brain in a temporally dynamic manner that is not evaluated through static connectivity analyses. This study distinguished dynamic FC differences involving reward‐related regions associated with cannabis use and linked the subjective craving in cannabis users with changes in the variability of dynamic connectivity measures. The results complement previous knowledge on static FC, and potentially add systematic evidences to the known models of SUDs from a specific case of cannabis use. \n\n### Temporally dynamic nature of task‐modulated connectivity during cue‐reactivity \n  \nThe concept of dynamic FC represents the nonstationary nature of connectivity, the mean and variance of which is altered by the internal functional state of the brain (Chang & Glover,  ), such as the level of consciousness (Barttfeld et al.,  ), alertness (Chang, Liu, Chen, Liu, & Duyn,  ), sleep stages (Tagliazucchi & Laufs,  ), or task conditions (Braun et al.,  ; Fong et al.,  ). Drug cue exposure is likely to affect the BOLD signal in the DA reward pathway, or mesocorticolimbic pathway (Filbey et al.,  ,  ; Filbey & Dunlop,  ), which may lead to BOLD‐derived FC changes. The mesocorticolimbic pathway originates from the midbrain (ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra) that elicits DA modulation upon NAcc (Yun, Wakabayashi, Fields, & Nicola,  ) and the prefrontal cortex (Lewis & O'Donnell,  ). We therefore expected that the dynamic nature of cue‐induced DA signal changes in the midbrain underlies the changes in dynamic FC. \n\nUpon the exposure to cannabis cues for cannabis users, DA signals in the mesocorticolimbic reward pathway may increase (Berridge & Robinson,  ), potentially reflecting the increased salience attribution and motivated processing of information in the users (Littel, Euser, Munafo, & Franken,  ; Norberg, Kavanagh, Olivier, & Lyras,  ). In this study, we found that the main effect of task is significant for the variability of both primary and secondary measures. Further, it clearly delineated across different task conditions during the cue exposure task, suggesting that the nonstationarity of FC changes is highly relevant to the main effect of the task upon FC measures. This may imply that the dynamic changes in DA signals are transient so that they may not be fully estimated using the static connectivity model. \n\nThere are tonic and phasic activity patterns of DA neurons; while tonic activity represents a steady frequency of firing, phasic shows a transiently faster, burst‐then‐pause rhythm of firing (Floresco, West, Ash, Moore, & Grace,  ). Phasic activity induces a surging increase of DA release (Gonon,  ), and is known to facilitate reward‐motivated reinforcement learning (Goto & Grace,  ; Grace, Floresco, Goto, & Lodge,  ; Wolfram Schultz,  ). An optogenetics study has shown that phasic activity is sufficient for behavioral conditioning (Tsai et al.,  ), which is a key process related to SUDs (Everitt, Dickinson, & Robbins,  ). Phasic DA activity in NAcc is known to increase in a temporally associated manner in rats trained to self‐administer cocaine toward drug‐related cues, along with the actual increase of DA release in the NAcc core (Ito, Dalley, Howes, Robbins, & Everitt,  ; Stuber, Roitman, Phillips, Carelli, & Wightman,  ). On the contrary, the same activity seems to decrease during withdrawal period in rats chronically exposed to THC (Diana, Melis, Muntoni, & Gessa,  ). This implies that the modulation of reward‐related DA signals in NAcc of cannabis users fluctuates. It further corroborates that the DA signal changes in cue‐reactivity will be more dynamic for cannabis users compared to controls, which may have led to increased variability of dynamic connectivity in users. We did not find a group × task interaction effect, which suggests that task‐modulated changes in DA signals did not affect the dynamic FC to an extent that can overcome the group differences. \n\n\n### Variability in functional connectivity weights \n  \nThe variability of dynamic FC weights between NAcc and the CEN was found to be higher in the CAN group. NAcc and the CEN have generalizable and important implications in SUDs, especially in addressing behavioral aspects via the addiction model of Impaired Response Inhibition and Salience Attribution (iRISA; R. Z. Goldstein & Volkow,  ; Zilverstand et al.,  ). This model aims to explain the mechanisms of SUDs that correspond to behavioral stages of binge‐intoxication, withdrawal‐negative affect, and preoccupation‐anticipation (Koob & Volkow,  ). The functional underpinning of this cycle is hypothesized to be the downregulated executive control that modulates response inhibition (R. Z. Goldstein & Volkow,  ) and imbalanced salience attribution that focuses on drug‐related cues above others (Droutman, Read, & Bechara,  ). Our finding showed that the temporal link between subcortical reward locus (NAcc) and the CEN involved in response inhibition fluctuates more in the cannabis users, supporting the iRISA model by showing the neural marker of significant interplay between two functions supposedly imbalanced. This systematic evidence based on cannabis users might be applicable to the other types of SUDs that share the behavioral aspects of the development. \n\nThe loss of executive or inhibitory control that leads to impulsive action is prominent in SUDs (Bari & Robbins,  ), and it causes susceptibility toward the onset and further use of illicit drugs (Brockett, Pribut, Vázquez, & Roesch,  ; Dalley, Everitt, & Robbins,  ; Dalley & Robbins,  ). The CEN and the SN are two major intrinsic networks involved in this function, potentially reorienting attention based on task objectives or the salience of information, respectively (Corbetta, Patel, & Shulman,  ; Dalley & Robbins,  ; Dodds, Morein‐Zamir, & Robbins,  ). These two networks seem to collaborate in response to environmental stressors in general, including reward‐related situations that subsequently induce DA impulse, to react and process the information (Hermans, Henckens, Joels, & Fernandez,  ). The CEN is more involved in goal‐oriented, or task‐modulated processing that aids decision making (Dodds et al.,  ; Menon,  ) and, importantly, response inhibition (Chikazoe et al.,  ; Dodds et al.,  ; van Gaal, Ridderinkhof, Scholte, & Lamme,  ). Functions of NAcc support the subjective appraisal of value by putting incentive into consideration (Milton & Everitt,  ), and its neural activity relates to salience and reward (Cooper & Knutson,  ; Horvitz,  ). \n\nNeural responses of NAcc and the CEN both appear to imply changes in craving or reward‐related decision making. For substance‐dependent users, the neural activity in NAcc increases in response to drug‐related cues (Koob & Volkow,  ), and cannabis users with more problematic symptoms show a higher activity here (Cousijn et al.,  ). The activity in NAcc seems to decrease in relation to downregulated craving toward cigarette smoking (Kober et al.,  ). On the other hand, the higher activity in regions in the CEN was correlated with lower craving in cigarette smokers (Kober et al.,  ) and cannabis users (Cousijn et al.,  ). Furthermore, FC within the CEN may decrease in the resting state for chronic stimulant users, while it may increase within the mesocorticolimbic reward pathway (including NAcc), and between the CEN and the reward pathway (Zilverstand et al.,  ). In sum, the pattern of activity and connectivity changes in the reward pathway and the CEN may be the opposite at the same functional state. The variability of dynamic FC between two may thus reflect their more fluctuating interplay due to their distinct differences in the functional states. \n\nThe increased dynamic connectivity variability in cannabis users may have been affected by the fluctuations of DA signals between cue ON and OFF states. The change was found to be independent of task conditions, possibly because it reflects the dysfunctional modulation of DA signal, not a mere increase or a decrease in the magnitude (see   for findings in the average of dynamic connectivity). The DA signal in NAcc is known to be a dynamic modulator of motivated behaviors in general (Salamone, Correa, Mingote, & Weber,  ; W. Schultz,  ), and an impairment to NAcc core leads to impulsivity rather than the loss of motivated behaviors (Cardinal, Pennicott, Lakmali, Robbins, & Everitt,  ), which relates to SUDs (Brockett et al.,  ; Dalley et al.,  ; Dalley & Robbins,  ). Originally, the DA signal from the midbrain that projects to the lateral prefrontal cortex in the CEN aids the cognitive control of action not by weight information by the reward value, but rather by providing the salience signal (Ott & Nieder,  ). However, while the reward pathway including NAcc is activated by immediately available rewards, regions in the CEN are activated by delayed rewards that require more cognitive resource to eventually make a less impulsive decision (McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein, & Cohen,  ). These literatures imply that the executive control of the CEN over reward‐related information such as cannabis cues is hierarchically positioned higher and is activated depending on the current state of “wanting” represented by the reward pathway. The striatum and the prefrontal cortex functionally interact for reward‐related decision making (Cools,  ). DA signal seems to provide the goal‐oriented flexibility in NAcc (Haluk & Floresco,  ), and the stability by concentrating on goals in prefrontal cortex (Bloemendaal et al.,  ; Noudoost & Moore,  ). Chronic cannabis use can induce dysfunctional modulation of DA signals and FC of NAcc (Manza, Tomasi, & Volkow,  ; van de Giessen et al.,  ; Volkow et al.,  ) and aberrances in activity and connectivity within the CEN (Krmpotich et al.,  ; Tapert et al.,  ). It can further weaken the interaction between the prefrontal cortex and NAcc (Fischer, Whitfield‐Gabrieli, Roth, Brunette, & Green,  ; Hwang & Lupica,  ). In sum, the increased variability between NAcc and the CEN in cannabis users may indicate the lack of stable modulation upon the reward‐related DA signal. \n\nWe found a positive correlation of dynamic connectivity variability within the CEN with the prescan (baseline) craving. This correlation may imply the involvement of the dysfunctional CEN in managing the craving (Luijten et al.,  ; Zilverstand et al.,  ), reflecting the higher demand of cognitive control over the transient fluctuations of DA signals. Dynamic connectivity variability from NAcc to the three intrinsic networks showed significant positive correlation with the during‐scan craving regardless of the task conditions, except in NAcc‐SN where cannabis cue ON condition did not pass the multiple correction. This probably indicates that the fluctuations of DA signals in NAcc are constantly affecting some of the major large‐scale intrinsic networks. The during‐scan craving may relate to the relapse of substance use (Crombag, Bossert, Koya, & Shaham,  ; Grimm, Hope, Wise, & Shaham,  ). Two of the neural underpinnings of the discrepancy between prescan and during‐scan cravings are the loss of DA signals during withdrawal (Diana et al.,  ) and the cue‐induced phasic DA signals (Berridge & Robinson,  ), both of which can increase the fluctuation of the DA signal over time. This suggests that the during‐scan craving may be more dependent on the dysfunctional modulation of striatal DA signals. Meanwhile, the variability of dynamic FC between NAcc and the three intrinsic networks was not correlated with the prescan craving, which may also imply that the effect of unstable modulation of DA signals is subject to external treatment to reduce craving during the cue exposure task, but not the abstinence period. Perhaps targeting the CEN may be more effective in managing the craving during cannabis abstinence, because of the relevance of the variability of dynamic FC to prescan craving. \n\n\n### Variability in topological indexes \n  \nThe most prominent finding is that the pattern of changes between states of natural reward cue ON versus OFF is the opposite of what is observed in neutral and cannabis cue states. This contrast is clearer than that from the dynamic primary measures in this study. The substance‐dependent users show markers of higher allocation of attention to substance cues than neutral cues regardless of substance types and whether abstinence was on (Littel et al.,  ). The extant addiction models hypothesize that the positive reinforcement caused by drugs of abuse acts the same as that by natural rewards, and overrides the reward effect from nondrug gains by abnormally highlighting the reward of drug (Kelley & Berridge,  ). In a cue exposure task, natural reward cues are introduced to distinguish the inherent motivational relevance from what is caused by the effect of substances (Versace et al.,  ). The current study showed that the pattern of task‐modulated variability of topological reorganization during exposure to cannabis cues appears to be significantly different from that found with natural reward cues, but like that with neutral cues. The lack of group‐task interaction suggests that this effect is not unique for the cannabis users. The present result represents the systematic marker of dynamic FC that highlights the differences in the neural underpinning for processing natural reward compared to the conditioned reward (cannabis) or neutral information, regardless of chronic cannabis use. \n\nPrevious studies have suggested that dynamic FC appear to denote an adaptive change in interaction within and between different functional modalities based on given tasks (Braun et al.,  ). This includes large‐scale changes, such as; linking more to the prefrontal network, that is, the CEN, for tasks that require executive controls (Braun et al.,  ; Cole, Reynolds, et al.,  ); connecting regions in the DMN across the brain for more global integration of information (Vatansever, Manktelow, Sahakian, Menon, & Stamatakis,  ; Vatansever, Menon, Manktelow, Sahakian, & Stamatakis,  ) and; in terms of topological features of the FC, adjusting the roles of the most densely connected brain hubs to increase the network efficiency at the moment (de Pasquale et al.,  ). Topological reorganization of the connectivity seems to alter the network efficiency (integration) and modularity (segregation) depending on the types of task demands (Cohen & D'Esposito,  ). Liégeois et al. ( ) used Human Connectome Project datasets to show that dynamic connectivity provides more information for explaining variances of task‐modulated behaviors. During tasks, DA is known to actively and dynamically modulate the sensory information and the executive functions in the prefrontal cortex (Ott & Nieder,  ). Taken together, the dynamic topological reorganization in the brain may be affected by the task‐modulated activity of DA, probably in the prefrontal cortex. The differential pattern of changes in dynamic FC variability found during exposure to natural reward cues could indicate that the roles of DA signal are also distinct compared to when exposed to the other cues. A further study is needed to clarify the neural underpinning of this phenomenon, especially testing for the effect of abstinence, and the type of illicit drugs of abuse. \n\nWe found that as the variability of network modularity increase, so does prescan craving. Network modularity conceptually represents the degree of modal and segregated communications across brain regions (Cohen & D'Esposito,  ). Higher modularity is prominent during simpler motor tasks (Cohen & D'Esposito,  ), and relates to higher perceptual acuity in a sensory task (Sadaghiani, Poline, Kleinschmidt, & D'Esposito,  ). Lower modularity, on the other hand, reflects less segregated network organization, and seems to be a marker for the functional state favorable for the awareness of the target information (Godwin, Barry, & Marois,  ). A fluctuating modularity across conditions therefore indicates an unstable state switching between functional modes apt for distinct tasks. Since our task has not given goals that require cognitive load, this fluctuation cannot be due to internal adaptation for the task performance. It appears that after the external administration of L‐DOPA, network modularity decreases (Alavash et al.,  ) and the connectivity between subcortical regions and cortical networks may increase (D. M. Cole, Oei, et al.,  ), leading the functional structure to be more integrated than segregated. This may imply that during the cue exposure task under higher prescan craving, the DA modulation upon the brain network is less stable in cannabis users. The current results suggest that the unstable segregation of the brain network relates to the loss of DA signal balance, which is potentially more disrupted in cannabis users than the controls. \n\n\n### Limitations and suggestions for future studies \n  \nOne of this study's limitations is that the subjective level of craving can be affected by several factors not fully quantified in this study. Two of the major examples are hormonal changes associated with menstrual period in female, and the time of day. Sherman, Caruso, and McRae‐Clark ( ) found that an external administration of progesterone may attenuate abstinence‐induced craving for cannabis (marginally significant effect), suggesting that the level of female hormone can affect the level of subjective craving. In addition, when the craving is present, time of day had a significant main effect upon its subjective level (Shrier, Walls, Kendall, & Blood,  ). These can be controlled for identifying a clearer effect of craving in future studies. Second, it is another limitation that the potential covariate effect of the comorbidity of nicotine use and the cannabis use, was not explored in this study. A future investigation with a larger sample size of the cannabis users, and a control group that includes a sizable number of nicotine users may be able to substantiate the effect. \n\nLindquist et al. ( ) introduced DCC and noted its lower precision for handling short‐term state changes in the fMRI signal. Although this study used a block design in the cue‐exposure task (cue exposure and washout for 20 s), whose effect may account for longer‐term changes in functional state, they may still be underestimated according to Lindquist et al. ( ). We considered the transient effect in dynamic FC by weighting the resultant primary and secondary measures with HRF‐convolved time series to avoid a brief‐term effect at the very beginning and the end of each block so that changes DCC was slow to detect minimally bias our results. The present results not only show significant task effect across conditions, but also a consistent increase in the   SD   of DCC in CAN group for NAcc‐CEN regardless of task conditions. Thus, our main results are less likely to have been compromised by the underestimation for brief changes. Nevertheless, it is certainly possible that rapid states including emotional disturbance or arousal in attention would be present in cannabis users upon cue exposure. To understand these functional effect, more elaborate task design should be accompanied with an alternative metric for dynamic FC, that is, dynamic connectivity regression (Cribben, Haraldsdottir, Atlas, Wager, & Lindquist,  ), which Lindquist et al. ( ) has referred to. \n\nThe association of cognitive functions with the cannabis use, especially focusing on the functions of response inhibition and salience attribution, may be further studied. The study will support the link of dynamic FC alterations with the central functional effect of substance use in accordance to the iRISA model. In the same context, the task‐modulated role of the DMN, which relates to the processing of internal information, or the nontask states (Raichle,  ), may be further investigated to verify its roles separate from the CEN in more cognitive tasks. Recently, Zhang and Volkow ( ) extensively reviewed evidences showing that the impairment of DA signaling can prevent the normal functions of the DMN, and the interplay of the DMN with the CEN and the SN are disrupted in SUDs. Dynamic FC studies that integrate the general implications of the DMN to the addiction models are desired. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nUtilizing the dynamic functional connectivity, we were able to quantify the task‐modulated variability of connectivity weights and topological indexes over time. The current results identified the system‐to‐behavior level link in cannabis use based on the correlational analysis of dynamic functional connectivity and subjective craving. Our findings suggest that the alterations in the variability of dynamic connectivity in cannabis users reflect their underlying dysfunctions in modulating dopamine system in molecular level that is constantly present in long‐term users, and that the dysfunctions affect large‐scale intrinsic networks via subcortical to cortical link. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors report no conflict of interest. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"efecfb0998b189d58be0f5ad81d84ae2"},

Functional connectivity (FC) has been mostly assessed assuming that FC is static across the whole fMRI examination. However, FC is highly variable at a very fast time-scale, as demonstrated by neurophysiological techniques. Time-varying functional connectivity (TVC) is a novel approach that allows capturing reoccurring patterns of interaction among functional brain networks. Aim of this review is to provide a description of the methods currently used to assess TVC on RS fMRI data, and to summarize the main results of studies applying TVC in healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). An overview of the main results obtained in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions is also provided. The most popular TVC approach is based on the so-called “sliding windows,” in which the RS fMRI acquisition is divided in small temporal segments (windows). A window of fixed length is shifted over RS fMRI time courses, and data within each window are used to calculate FC and its variability over time. Sliding windows can be combined with clustering techniques to identify recurring FC states or used to assess global TVC properties of large-scale functional networks or specific brain regions. TVC studies have used heterogeneous methodologies so far. Despite this, similar results have been obtained across investigations. In healthy subjects, the default-mode network (DMN) exhibited the highest degree of connectivity dynamism. In MS patients, abnormal global TVC properties and TVC strengths were found mainly in sensorimotor, DMN and salience networks, and were associated with more severe structural MRI damage and with more severe physical and cognitive disability. Conversely, abnormal TVC measures of the temporal network were correlated with better cognitive performances and less severe fatigue. In patients with neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, TVC abnormalities of the DMN, attention and executive networks were associated to more severe clinical manifestations. TVC helps to provide novel insights into fundamental properties of functional networks, and improves the understanding of brain reorganization mechanisms. Future technical advances might help to clarify TVC association with disease prognosis and response to treatment. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe human brain at resting state (RS) exhibits highly structured spontaneous fluctuations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, which reflect the underlying network architecture (Biswal et al.,  ). RS functional connectivity (FC) captures the temporal associations between such fluctuations, and has been successfully used to characterize the main networks of the brain and map abnormalities of functional network architecture occurring in different neurological conditions. In healthy controls, RS FC strength was found to be associated to age, with RS fluctuations being strongest in adulthood and lowest in children and elderly (Mak et al.,  ). A dependency of connectivity from sex (Biswal et al.,  ; Mak et al.,  ), as well as from cognitive, emotional, and behavioral variables was also detected (Kelly et al.,  ). \n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system leading to a progressive increase over time of clinical disability and cognitive impairment (Filippi et al.,  ,  ). Reorganization of brain functional networks in MS has been shown from the first RS fMRI studies (Lowe et al.,  ,  ; Rocca et al.,  ; Roosendaal et al.,  ), which is thought to limit the clinical consequences of widespread tissue damage (Filippi et al.,  ; Sbardella et al.,  ). Cortical reorganization has been demonstrated to be variable across the different stages of the disease, and a progressive exhaustion or inefficiency of the adaptive properties of the cerebral cortex is likely to be among the factors responsible for the worsening of clinical disability (Rocca et al.,  ,  ; Roosendaal et al.,  ; Loitfelder et al.,  ). In neurodegenerative conditions, RS FC studies showed a progressive and gradual spreading of connectivity changes from a target brain network, reflecting specific behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions (Zhou et al.,  ). In psychiatric diseases, disruption of fronto-parietal network connectivity seems to be the common fingerprint across distinct forms of pathology (Baker et al.,  ). \n\nHowever, current understanding of the role of functional abnormalities in neurological and psychiatric disorders is still incomplete, mostly due to inconsistencies in the findings from several studies. Specifically, in MS some investigations found trends toward lower RS FC vs. healthy controls in the default-mode (Rocca et al.,  ,  ,  ; Bonavita et al.,  ), sensorimotor (Rocca et al.,  ) and subcortical (Liu et al.,  ; Rocca et al.,  ) networks, while in other studies the opposite trends were observed (Roosendaal et al.,  ; Tona et al.,  ; Schoonheim et al.,  ). Similarly, even if RS FC abnormalities were principally located in the core regions hit by pathology, a certain variability of brain areas involved by RS FC changes was detected in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions (Busatto,  ; Weiner et al.,  ). \n\nThe wide spectrum of clinical characteristics of MS patients has been considered as one of the main causes for the discrepancies described in RS fMRI literature (Filippi et al.,  ; Sbardella et al.,  ). However, technical factors might also bias connectivity estimation, including scanner-related signal instabilities, an inappropriate control of confounding covariates, and the application of analysis methods based on inaccurate assumptions. \n\nFor instance, one of the main assumptions of classical RS FC assessment methods is that connectivity is static across the entire fMRI examination, e.g., it can be assessed by calculating the mean correlation between whole-length RS fMRI time series (Biswal et al.,  ). However, as widely evident by neurophysiological techniques, brain FC is highly variable at a very fast time-scale. The functioning human brain during any state of wakefulness repeatedly changes between different combinations of cognitive, sensorimotor, attentional, emotional, auditory, and visual-related tasks. Notably, the majority of brain regions experience continuous functional changes even during sleep (Tagliazucchi and van Someren,  ). Thus, studying time-varying RS FC patterns is likely to shed light not only on physiological processes occurring in healthy subjects, but also to understand clinical manifestations of different neurological and psychiatric conditions. In fact, clinical symptoms associated to these diseases are likely to depend not only from damage to specific brain regions, but also from delayed (or abnormal) communication between brain areas. The study of the temporal reconfigurations of FC occurring within RS fMRI sessions has been defined as   time-varying functional connectivity (TVC)   (Hutchison et al.,  ; Calhoun et al.,  ; Preti et al.,  ). \n\nThe main goal of this review is to summarize the main results obtained using TVC in healthy and diseased populations. A particular focus is given to studies of patients with MS; however, the main findings of investigations performed in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions are also reported. The review is structured as follows: in section Methods Used to Assess Time-Varying Functional Connectivity, we present the main approaches developed to investigate TVC using fMRI data, with a main emphasis on the methods applied to study MS patients. Then, we summarize the results obtained applying these methods in healthy controls (section Application of TVC to Healthy Subjects) and in patients with MS (section Application of TVC Techniques to MS). An overview of the results derived from other neurological and psychiatric conditions is also given (section Application of Time-Varying FC Techniques to Psychiatric and Other Neurological Diseases). In the final part (section Current Limitations and Future Directions), current TVC methodological limitations are discussed and possible future developments are presented. \n\n\n## Methods Used to Assess Time-Varying Functional Connectivity \n  \nSeveral analysis strategies have been applied so far to quantify temporal variations of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations (Hutchison et al.,  ; Preti et al.,  ). Some strategies aim at capturing variations in inter-regional associations between pairs of brain areas (Sakoglu et al.,  ; Allen et al.,  ), while others try to detect changing patterns of temporal synchrony at a multivariate level, e.g., considering all brain regions at once (Tagliazucchi et al.,  ; Liu and Duyn,  ). One of the most popular methods for TVC analysis, which is based on the use of the so-called “sliding windows” (Sakoglu et al.,  ; Allen et al.,  ), belongs to the first category, since it relies on the calculation of a series of pairwise correlation coefficients over small shifting segments of fMRI time series. \n\nDespite the great variability of available pipelines, TVC analysis usually requires the performance of the following steps: (1) selection of a set of regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain; (2) assessment of time-varying correlations among the selected ROIs; and (3) extraction of features quantifying connectivity changes over time, as described in details in the next paragraphs. \n\n### Selection of Regions of Interest for TVC Analysis \n  \nIt is important to properly identify the ROIs (which may be areas of the brain, or even entire functional networks) that will be included in TVC analysis. Several factors can influence the choice of ROIs: spatial resolution, the use of   a priori   hypotheses or data-driven strategies, and the rationale of the experiment, which may focus on selected functional circuits or on the whole brain. \n\nThe large majority of studies assessing TVC in MS patients mainly relied on the use of   a priori   atlases, such as the Automatic Anatomical Labeling (AAL) (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al.,  ) or the Desikan (Desikan et al.,  ) cortical atlas (Leonardi et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ; van Geest et al.,  , ). Some studies built   ad-hoc   ROIs centered in critical nodes of large-scale brain networks (Bosma et al.,  ). However, a widely used approach in previous literature consists in a ROI data-driven selection through independent component analysis (ICA; Rocca et al.,  ,  ; Sakoglu et al.,  ; Filippi et al.,  ; Allen et al.,  ; Damaraju et al.,  ; Yang et al.,  ; Zalesky et al.,  ; Bisecco et al.,  ; Castellazzi et al.,  ; d'Ambrosio et al.,  ) ( ). The broad application of ICA in previous TVC studies can be explained by the flexibility of this approach, which allows to extract ROIs at different spatial resolution according to ICA dimensionality, to perfectly fit the data (avoiding non-linear registrations with   a priori   atlases, which may be challenging in diseased populations) and to reduce the impact of physiological and motion-related noise. \n  \nSchematic representation of the post-processing steps used in the assessment of time-varying functional connectivity (TVC). Top row: selection of regions of interest for TVC analysis, which can be done using data-driven approaches (e.g., independent component analysis,   A  ) or using a priori atlases   (B)  . Middle row: assessment of time-varying correlations between fMRI time series. The most popular approach consists in using a sliding-window analysis   (C)  ; alternative approaches, such as time-frequency analysis   (D)   or point-process analysis   (E)   have been also proposed. Bottom row: extraction of features quantifying connectivity changes over time, which can be done using several techniques, such as graph theory   (F)  , k-means clustering to estimate recurring TVC states   (G)  , or fuzzy meta-state analysis   (H)  . ICA, independent component analysis; AAL, automatic anatomical labeling; ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; CAP, co-activation pattern; MCC, middle cingulate cortex; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; SPG, superior parietal gyrus; MFG, middle frontal gyrus; R, right; L, left. \n  \nSince ROIs identified by “static”   a priori   atlases may not reflect significant connectivity variations occurring within brain regions at short time scales (Ryyppo et al.,  ), recent studies have suggested that incorporating information of time-varying connectivity between neighboring voxels to parcellate the brain may improve accuracy of TVC analyses (Preti and Van De Ville,  ; Ryyppo et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Assessment of Time-Varying Correlations Among Brain Regions \n  \n#### Sliding Window Analysis \n  \nThe most popular strategy used to examine time-varying correlations between RS fMRI time series relies on the use of sliding windows (Sakoglu et al.,  ; Allen et al.,  ). In this approach, a time window of fixed length is selected, and correlations between pairs of fMRI time series are calculated using data within that window. Then, the window is shifted in time by a certain number of time points, and correlations are re-assessed on the new data. This procedure results in a series of pair-wise correlation matrices that describe the time-resolved behavior of connectivity over the entire duration of the fMRI experiment (Allen et al.,  ;  ). \n\nThe choice of an appropriate length for sliding windows is crucial: too short time segments may introduce spurious fluctuations associated with intrinsic fMRI signal instability, while with increased window size TVC estimation may become too similar to the classic static FC (Leonardi and Van De Ville,  ; Preti et al.,  ). Different validation analyses recommended to set window length around 30–60 s (or the equivalent time expressed as repetition times, TRs), demonstrating consistent reproducibility of the obtained results (Allen et al.,  ; Damaraju et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ,  ; Zalesky et al.,  ; Leonardi and Van De Ville,  ; Qin et al.,  ; Zalesky and Breakspear,  ; Choe et al.,  ; Zhang C. et al.,  ). \n\nOnce sliding windows correlation matrices have been produced, different strategies can be applied to extract features describing connectivity reorganization through time inside the data (Leonardi et al.,  ; Allen et al.,  ; Miller et al.,  ), as described in details in section Extraction of Features Quantifying Time-Varying Connectivity. \n\n\n#### Beyond Sliding-Window Analysis \n  \nA variety of approaches alternative to sliding windows have been developed to quantify TVC in fMRI data (Preti et al.,  ). For instance, time-frequency decomposition has been used to represent correlations between two fMRI time series in the joint time and frequency domain (Chang and Glover,  ; Yaesoubi et al.,  ;  ). Point-process analysis allowed to detect recurring patterns of co-activation between brain regions from a small fraction of the total scans of a RS fMRI experiment (Tagliazucchi et al.,  ; Liu and Duyn,  ). Phase coherence connectivity has been proposed to calculate RS FC at each recorded fMRI time point (Deco and Kringelbach,  ). \n\nIn MS studies, two alternative methods to sliding windows have been applied. One study (Bosma et al.,  ) used dynamic conditional correlations (DCC) to quantify TVC. DCC were originally proposed to study fluctuations of financial time series (Engle,  ) and subsequently adapted to neuroimaging data to quantify time-varying variances and correlations between multivariate RS fMRI time series (Lindquist et al.,  ). DCC overcome some limitations intrinsic to sliding-window techniques, since they do not depend from any arbitrary window length and do not give the same weight to all time points within the window, ignoring older observations. Moreover, DCC are not easily confused by changes of correlation occurring in fMRI time series merely due to random noise (Lindquist et al.,  ). \n\nAnother study (Zhou et al.,  ) quantified connectivity reorganization over time using brain entropy (BEN). Entropy is a statistical and physical index that measures irregularity of a time-varying system (Sandler,  ). In RS fMRI data, voxel-wise assessments of entropy were performed by calculating sample entropy, defined as the negative logarithm of the probability that if two time series of length   m   have a correlation <   r  , then two time series of length   m  +  1   also have a correlation <   r  . A higher entropy indicates increased randomness of a system, meaning that the time-varying system activity is less predictable and less organized (Wang et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n### Extraction of Features Quantifying Time-Varying Connectivity \n  \nSliding-window (or alternative) techniques produce a large amount of correlation data, calculated on several time segments. Some features have then to be extracted from this big data mass, to summarize to what extent functional relationships reorganize through time. The simplest summary TVC statistic is standard deviation (or variance) of sliding-window correlation time series (Sakoglu et al.,  ; Choe et al.,  ) or of DCC time series (Lindquist et al.,  ; Bosma et al.,  ). The mean TVC (Huang et al.,  ) or the sum of absolute differences in pair-wise connectivity between consecutive windows have also been used as a summary TVC measure (van Geest et al.,  , ). Another interesting metric assessing temporal variability of BOLD fluctuations is the so-called amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations functional connectivity (ALFF-FC) (Shen et al.,  ), which sums up the spectral content of low-frequency RS fluctuations through consecutive sliding windows. \n\nFlexibility metrics quantifying time-varying global and regional network properties were also calculated using a graph theory framework (Lin et al.,  ), as described in section Graph Theoretical Analysis. More complex strategies rely on the identification of connectivity patterns that reoccur over time during the course of the experiment. Reoccurring RS FC patterns, often called “states,” can be determined using clustering techniques (Allen et al.,  ), principal component analysis (Leonardi et al.,  ) or tensor decomposition (Mokhtari et al.,  ), as detailed in section Definition of Reoccurring Connectivity States. Finally, approaches overcoming a rigid data decomposition into “fixed” connectivity states have been recently proposed (Miller et al.,  ), as described in detail in section Fuzzy Meta-State Analysis. \n\n#### Graph Theoretical Analysis \n  \nGraph theory analysis can be applied to series of matrices derived from sliding-window analysis ( ). Besides the classical network metrics (Rubinov and Sporns,  ), which can be quantified as a function of time (Fukushima and Sporns,  ), more specific metrics can be used to assess time-varying network structure. For instance, network power measures the summed values of TVC pairs in all windows, and density estimates how dense, on average, connections are over time. Specific time-resolved network features include network variation, which describes how different are connectivity values between two adjacent windows, flexibility of homologous, non-homologous and intra-hemispheric connections, which quantify connectivity differences between two consecutive windows for the specified type of connections (Lin et al.,  ), or the Fiedler value, which summarizes how well-connected a network is (Cai J. et al.,  ). Recently, novel approaches have been proposed to improve modeling of brain network TVC using graph theory (Khambhati et al.,  ). Such modeling strategies aim to assess time-varying patterns of connectivity (e.g., dynamic community detection or non-negative matrix factorization), time-varying patterns of activity, or a combination of both. A detailed review of these methods is reported in Khambhati et al. ( ). \n\n\n#### Definition of Reoccurring Connectivity States \n  \nOne of the most diffuse approaches used to identify reoccurring FC states from sliding-window matrices is based on hard-clustering algorithms (Preti et al.,  ), such as the k-means algorithm (Allen et al.,  ). In this approach, data are partitioned into different connectivity states by maximizing a cluster validity index, which describes the between-cluster/within-cluster distance ratio. In this way, identified recurring connectivity states have a minimal degree of overlap (Allen et al.,  ). The amount of time spent in each recurring state (dwell time) and the number of transitions between states can be calculated and compared between groups ( ). Between-group comparisons can be also performed on pair-wise TVC strengths within each detected state (Allen et al.,  ). \n\nOther ways to identify FC states from sliding-window data rely on principal component analysis (PCA) (Leonardi et al.,  ) or tensor decomposition (Mokhtari et al.,  ). PCA is able to decompose sliding-window matrices into patterns of correlated connectivities (called “eigenconnectivities”) between brain regions. Each eigenconnectivity pattern is characterized by a “contribution” (which can be thought as the equivalent of dwell times for k-means clustering analysis), which varies over time across subjects. Between-group comparisons of such contributions may allow to characterize TVC abnormalities in patients' populations (Leonardi et al.,  ). Similarly, tensor decomposition (Mokhtari et al.,  ) is able to decompose sliding-window connectivity matrices in a set of components, each with an associated weight, which explain the majority of data content. \n\n\n#### Fuzzy Meta-State Analysis \n  \nIn hard-clustering analysis, windowed correlation matrices are forced to fit into determined TVC recurring states. However, the existence of just one state at each time point may be a too rigid assumption. A more flexible approach is to consider the possibility that multiple states might be represented to varying degrees at the same time point. The contribution of each state for a specific time is characterized by a vector that is called a “meta-state” (Miller et al.,  ). Four different measures of neural reorganization over time can be associated to such meta-states and can be calculated for each study subject: (1) the total number of distinct meta-states that a subject assumes during the experiment; (2) the number of changes between distinct meta-states; (3) the range of meta-states occupied in the n-dimensional meta-state space during the entire RS fMRI experiment; and (4) the total distance traveled in the n-dimensional state space ( ). \n\n\n\n\n## Application of TVC to Healthy Subjects \n  \n### Main TVC Findings in Healthy Subjects \n  \nThe results of the main studies assessing TVC in healthy controls are summarized in  . \n  \nSummary of studies assessing time-varying resting state functional connectivity in healthy subjects and simulated data. \n  \n RS, resting state; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; TVC, time-varying functional connectivity; ICA, independent component analysis; TR, repetition time; SD, standard deviation; EEG, electroencephalographic registration; AAL, automated anatomical labeling; ROIs, regions of interest; DMN, default-mode network; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; HCP, Human connectome project; UK, United Kingdom; FC, functional connectivity  . \n  \nIn healthy subjects, it was always possible to identify a certain number of recurring connectivity configurations (from 3 to 12, depending on the method applied and on RS fMRI sequence settings). The DMN was one of the functional networks showing the highest degree of connectivity change over time, both when analyzing within-DMN TVC (Chang and Glover,  ; Liu and Duyn,  ; Lindquist et al.,  ; Zalesky et al.,  ) and when considering connections between the DMN and other crucial cognitive networks (Chang and Glover,  ; Liu and Duyn,  ; Allen et al.,  ; Marusak et al.,  ; Vidaurre et al.,  ). High dynamism was also observed in multimodal brain regions, involved in high-order emotional and cognitive processing (Yang et al.,  ; Zalesky et al.,  ; Chen S. et al.,  ; Marusak et al.,  ; Vidaurre et al.,  ). Such quick temporal reconfigurations may be required to facilitate transient psychological states between different brain functions (starting, maintenance or conclusion of the different attentional, cognitive, and executive tasks). Conversely, networks involved in sensory and motor processing showed more “static” connectivity profiles (Allen et al.,  ; Zalesky et al.,  ). \n\nTVC was also useful to characterize age- and sex-related features. For instance, it was shown that children have higher TVC between the DMN and other subnetworks than young adults, but that young adults have stronger TVC than children among sensorimotor, executive control, and auditory networks (Cai B. et al.,  ). Moreover, variability of TVC among cognitive networks increased with age (Marusak et al.,  ). Overall, these results suggest that maturation is associated with a higher flexibility of functional connections. More discrepancies were found when analyzing sex-related characteristics of connectivity dynamics (Yaesoubi et al.,  , ; Nini et al.,  ). While some studies found no differences in TVC configurations between males and females (Yaesoubi et al.,  ), other studies found that connectivity configurations were different between genders (Yaesoubi et al.,  , ; Nini et al.,  ): males showed a higher connectivity flexibility than females in the amygdala, hippocampus, fusiform, and temporal gyrus, whereas the opposite trend was found in the middle cingulate cortex, thalamus, precuneus, and some temporal-occipital regions (Nini et al.,  ). \n\nTVC constitutes a complex and novel methodology. Studies from healthy controls also served to test how reliable and reproducible TVC results were across scanning sessions. This was the goal of some recent investigations (Choe et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ; Zhang C. et al.,  ), which found that TVC metrics were reliable across days (Smith et al.,  ) and had an overall good reproducibility (Choe et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ; Zhang C. et al.,  ), even if lower than that of the corresponding static FC metrics (Zhang C. et al.,  ). The highest reliability was found for intra-network connections in the DMN, fronto-parietal, sensorimotor, and occipital networks (Zhang C. et al.,  ). \n\nTo better investigate the intrinsic nature of TVC states and their electrophysiological correlates, simultaneously acquired electroencephalography (EEG) and RS fMRI data were analyzed and concurrent temporal variations were assessed (Allen et al.,  ). Results indicated that connectivity states detected by TVC analysis correspond to neuro-electric brain activity with distinct spectral signatures. Moreover, eyes open/eyes closed conditions show some common and some different connectivity patterns, with a greater integration within sensory systems, as well as reduced modularity and increased global efficiency, in the eyes-closed compared to the eyes-open condition (Allen et al.,  ). These results integrate and complete previous EGG/RS fMRI studies, which showed a variable TVC configuration between wakefulness and different stages of sleep (Tagliazucchi et al.,  ), with temporal memory and long-range temporal dependencies decreasing from wakefulness to deep non-rapid eye movement sleep. \n\n\n### Correlations Between TVC and Behavioral/Neuropsychological Performances in Healthy Subjects \n  \nTo date, correlations between TVC measures and cognitive performances in healthy controls have been evaluated by one study (Cabral et al.,  ), which found that worse cognitive performance in healthy elderly was associated with a lower permanence in a TVC state characterized by strong, positive connectivity. These results suggest that a more static pattern of TVC may characterize poor vs. good performers. \n\nAnother study (Shi et al.,  ) analyzed the correlation between TVC and scores obtained at questionnaires of subjective well-being, and found that subjects with higher well-being scores spent less time in low cross-network and strong within-network connectivity states. The total number of transitions between states was also higher in subjects with high well-being scores, suggesting a more efficient transfer of information between networks in this group (Shi et al.,  ). Finally, two studies assessing the relationship between TVC and mindfulness in healthy adults (Lim et al.,  ) and children (Marusak et al.,  ) had similar conclusions, showing that high-mindfulness subjects spent more time in highly-connected states and switched more frequently between states than low-mindfulness subjects, suggesting a more efficient and flexible connectivity in the first group. \n\n\n\n## Application of TVC Techniques to MS \n  \n### Main TVC Findings in MS Patients \n  \nThe main studies assessing TVC abnormalities in MS patients are summarized in  . As it is evident from this table, TVC methodologies applied in MS investigations were quite heterogeneous. Despite this, results of different studies share some common points. \n  \nSummary of studies assessing time-varying resting state functional connectivity modifications in multiple sclerosis (MS). \n  \n RS, resting state; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; TVC, time-varying functional connectivity; TR, repetition time; DMN, default-mode network; MS, multiple sclerosis; SD, standard deviation; AAL, automated anatomical labeling; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; CIS, clinically isolated syndrome  . \n  \nFirst of all, networks showing the greatest amount of TVC abnormalities in MS patients in comparison to healthy subjects were the DMN, salience, executive and sensorimotor networks (Leonardi et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ; Bosma et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ; d'Ambrosio et al.,  ; Rocca et al.,  ). \n\nThe regional pattern of TVC abnormalities was quite complex, and regions involved by TVC changes were variable across studies, probably depending from the used TVC approach and patients' clinical characteristics. The analysis of eigenconnectivity patterns helped to identify the presence of stronger TVC in parietal regions and weaker TVC in frontal/subcortical regions in relapsing-remitting MS patients with mild to moderate disability compared to healthy controls (Leonardi et al.,  ). These patients also showed more frequently strong connections in temporal and parietal (angular gyrus) regions as well as weaker connections in motor and amygdalar regions vs. control subjects (Leonardi et al.,  ). Another study assessing TVC abnormalities in relapsing-remitting MS patients with mild disability found an increased BEN (corresponding to an increased connectivity disorganization) of regions involved in motor, executive and spatial coordination, as well as reduced BEN in memory brain areas (including temporal and hippocampal cortices) and relay areas as the cerebellum or the brainstem compared to healthy subjects (Zhou et al.,  ). \n\nA recent study using DCC to quantify TVC (Bosma et al.,  ) confirmed the results obtained by Leonardi et al. ( ), and found an increased BOLD signal variability in posterior regions of the DMN in MS patients vs. controls. The same study also found an increased TVC between the salience network and the ascending nociceptive pathway. Conversely, divergent results were obtained by Lin et al. ( ), who showed an overall reduction of network variation in MS patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a globally more “static” FC configuration, but at the same time found an increased flexibility of interhemispheric connections, which was interpreted as a compensatory mechanism for the decreased global connectivity. A complex pattern of increased and decreased TVC was also shown by d'Ambrosio et al. ( ), who found, in a multicenter study, a selective TVC increase between subcortical and visual/cognitive networks, and a TVC decrease between subcortical and sensorimotor networks in relapsing-remitting MS patients compared to healthy controls (d'Ambrosio et al.,  ). \n\nSpecific investigations of crucial systems involved in cognitive functions were performed by Van Geest et al., who studied TVC of the hippocampal network (Lin et al.,  ; van Geest et al.,  , ) and of the DMN (Lin et al.,  ; van Geest et al.,  , ) and by Huang et al., who investigated the attention network (Huang et al.,  ). Overall, hippocampal and DMN TVC were not different between MS patients and control subjects; however, including TVC measures in multivariate statistical models contributed to explain the performance of MS patients at visuospatial memory (Lin et al.,  ; van Geest et al.,  , ) and information processing speed (Lin et al.,  ; van Geest et al.,  , ) tasks. Huang et al. detected a complex pattern of TVC abnormalities, which was characterized by a TVC decrease within the dorsal and ventral attention networks, as well as TVC increase between the same networks (Huang et al.,  ). \n\nChanges in TVC at the earliest stages of the disease have been rarely assessed, but interesting results have been observed. Patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of MS exhibited, early after the first demyelinating attack, reduced TVC in the functional networks more affected by the clinical onset, compared to healthy controls (Rocca et al.,  ). These patients also showed, in the first 2 years after the clinical event, a progressive increase over time of TVC strength, mainly between the DMN and sensorimotor/visual/cognitive networks, combined with a progressive increase over time of global fuzzy meta-state dynamism (Rocca et al.,  ). \n\nOverall, these results suggest that, at the beginning of the disease, TVC dysfunctions have a specific correspondence with clinical symptoms. Then, a progressive increase of TVC oscillations occurs, probably trying to compensate disease-related damage. This initial phase seems to be followed by a loss of coordination and flexibility among brain regions in MS patients (Leonardi et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ; Lin et al.,  ; d'Ambrosio et al.,  ), which may be compensated by local increased fluctuations between specific areas (Lin et al.,  ;van Geest et al.,  , ). \n\nRecent studies tried to investigate TVC changes in MS populations affected by specific clinical manifestations. In details, cognitive impairment in patients with MS was associated to reduced TVC between subcortical and DMN areas, as well as to reduced global dynamism, compared to cognitively preserved patients (d'Ambrosio et al.,  ). Patients with MS suffering from neuropathic pain expressed selectively reduced TVC strength in the salience-descending nociceptive circuit (Bosma et al.,  ), whereas in patients without such neuropathic pain, TVC strength was increased in the same network (Bosma et al.,  ). \n\nThe large majority of the above-mentioned studies assessed TVC changes in relapsing-remitting MS patients, while detailed investigations of TVC abnormalities occurring in progressive MS phenotypes or over the course of the disease, are still missing. \n\n\n### Correlations Between TVC and Clinical, Neuropsychological, and Structural MRI Variables in MS \n  \nDifferent correlation analyses have been performed in MS patients, in order to understand the possible association between TVC abnormalities and motor and cognitive performances, as well as with specific clinical symptoms such as fatigue. \n\nA higher expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score, reflecting more severe clinical disability, was found to be correlated with increased BEN in the bilateral supplementary motor area and in the right precentral operculum (Zhou et al.,  ), as well as with a more rigid (less fluid) global connectivity in MS patients (Lin et al.,  ). Conversely, other studies failed to show significant associations between TVC abnormalities and disability, probably because of the relatively low sample size and/or a narrow EDSS range (Leonardi et al.,  ). \n\nSeveral correlations have been detected between TVC abnormalities and MS patients' cognitive performances. In particular, better scores in tests involving executive control functions and processing speed ability were correlated with a higher global network dynamism (Lin et al.,  ). Similar findings were shown by van Geest et al. ( ), who found that a higher dynamism in the DMN during an information processing speed task vs. a resting state condition was associated with better information processing speed performances. These results are in agreement with the reduced network dynamics observed in cognitively impaired vs. preserved MS patients (d'Ambrosio et al.,  ). Conversely, a lower hippocampal TVC contributed to explain, at least partially, better verbal learning, visuospatial learning, and memory performances (van Geest et al.,  ). \n\nLower fatigue was associated with reduced TVC in the parahippocampal gyrus, right posterior cerebellum, and brainstem (Zhou et al.,  ). Pain interference has been associated with increased TVC in the posterior cingulate cortex, an associative region involved in the salience and nociceptive networks and DMN (Bosma et al.,  ). \n\nA few studies investigated the relationship between TVC and white matter lesions or MS-related structural damage. Decreased TVC between parietal and fronto-temporal regions of the attention network was associated with an higher lesion load in relapsing-remitting MS patients (Huang et al.,  ). A significant association has been demonstrated between reduced global dynamism in cognitively impaired MS patients and brain atrophy (d'Ambrosio et al.,  ), as well as between increased TVC and diffuse microstructural damage in relapsing-remitting MS patients, quantified as a higher mean diffusivity on diffusion-tensor MRI (Zhou et al.,  ). At the earliest stages of MS, a progressive increase of TVC over 2 years of follow-up was associated with a lower white matter lesion volume change over the same period of time (Rocca et al.,  ). \n\nIn summary, in MS patients, abnormal global TVC properties of the sensorimotor, DMN and salience networks were associated with more severe tissue damage at structural MRI, more severe clinical disability, worse cognitive performance and pain interference, evidencing a maladaptive neuronal response to direct disease-related damage. Conversely, abnormal TVC properties of the temporal network and relay areas as the cerebellum and brainstem were correlated with better cognitive performances and less severe fatigue, suggesting a compensatory role of TVC changes. \n\n\n\n## Application of Time-Varying FC Techniques to Psychiatric and Other Neurological Diseases \n  \n### Main Findings in Psychiatric and Other Neurological Diseases \n  \nThe main studies discussed in this section are summarized in  . \n  \nSummary of studies assessing time-varying resting state functional connectivity modifications in different psychiatric and neurological pathologies (excluding multiple sclerosis). \n  \n RS, resting state; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; TVC, time-varying functional connectivity; TR, repetition time; ICA, independent component analysis; FBIRN, function biomedical informatics research network data; ADNI, Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative; SD, standard deviation; DMN, default-mode network; FC, functional connectivity; ROI, region of interest; GIG-ICA, group-information-guided ICA; AAL, automated anatomical labeling; COBRE, center for biomedical research excellence; EEG, electroencephalographic registration; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; CSI, connection strength index; CCI, connection count index; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute  . \n  \nSeveral studies tried to characterize TVC abnormalities present in different psychiatric and neurological diseases, sometimes looking for an early diagnostic biomarker (Du et al.,  ; Mennigen et al.,  ). Modification of TVC strength, dwell time or number of transitions between states varied according to the disease status in patients affected by bipolar disorder (Rashid et al.,  ,  ), schizophrenia (Yu et al.,  ; Cetin et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ; Gazula et al.,  ; Yue et al.,  ; Zhang W. et al.,  ), depression (Liao et al.,  ; Qiu et al.,  ; Zhi et al.,  ), autism (He et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ), stroke (Chen et al.,  ), mild traumatic brain injury (Vergara et al.,  ), epilepsy (Ridley et al.,  ; Klugah-Brown et al.,  ), Alzheimer's disease (Quevenco et al.,  ; Jie et al.,  ), and Parkinson's disease (Engels et al.,  ). \n\nIn psychiatric diseases, widespread TVC abnormalities have been found. Patients with bipolar disorder and major depression expressed TVC abnormalities mainly in executive (Rashid et al.,  ; Du et al.,  ), amygdala/salience (Qiu et al.,  ; Zhi et al.,  ), and salience/executive regions (Mokhtari et al.,  , ). Schizophrenia patients showed a complex pattern of decreased and increased TVC mainly in the DMN (Sakoglu et al.,  ; Abrol et al.,  ), and in frontal, parietal, auditory (Damaraju et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ; Du et al.,  ,  ; Sun et al.,  ), visual (Fu et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ; Sun et al.,  ), and thalamic areas (Damaraju et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ,  ; Du et al.,  ). Schizophrenia patients spent less time and made fewer transitions between states characterized by weak correlations between the thalami and sense-related brain regions (Damaraju et al.,  ). They also showed more lagged correlations between the DMN and sensory networks (Yaesoubi et al.,  ) and a higher occupancy rate of globally disconnected states (Yu et al.,  ; Cetin et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ; Gazula et al.,  ; Yue et al.,  ; Zhang W. et al.,  ). In children with autism spectrum disorders, TVC was mainly decreased in DMN and insular areas (Falahpour et al.,  ; Guo et al.,  ; He et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ). \n\nIn neurological disorders, TVC abnormalities have been mainly observed in areas directly affected by the disease. For example, subcortical stroke and mild traumatic brain injury patients showed TVC abnormalities in sensorimotor networks (Chen et al.,  ; Vergara et al.,  ). Patients with myoclonic/frontal lobe epilepsy showed reduced TVC mainly in frontal and parietal brain regions, whereas patients with temporal lobe epilepsy experienced TVC decrease mainly in temporal regions (Ridley et al.,  ; Klugah-Brown et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). Generalized epilepsy was related to TVC strength changes mainly in the DMN and cognitive networks (Liu et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ). Patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease had reduced regional (nodal) TVC (Alderson et al.,  ) and alterations in inter-network TVC of the anterior and posterior regions of the DMN (Jones et al.,  ; Quevenco et al.,  ), the frontal cortex and temporal areas (Jie et al.,  ). Patients with Parkinson's disease showed TVC changes mainly in sensorimotor, executive, cognitive (Liu et al.,  ), visual, and DMN areas (Diez-Cirarda et al.,  ), combined with reduced global and nodal TVC (Cai J. et al.,  ; Diez-Cirarda et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Correlations Between TVC and Clinical, Neuropsychological, and Structural MRI Variables in Psychiatric and Other Neurological Diseases \n  \nIn schizophrenia patients, reduced global time-resolved graph metrics have been related to structural disease-related damage (Yu et al.,  ), while abnormalities in TVC of auditory brain regions have been correlated with the presence of auditory hallucinations (Sun et al.,  ). Hallucinations were also correlated with a more rigid, reduced global dynamism (Miller et al.,  ; Mennigen et al.,  ). Autistic behavior and diagnosis were associated with longer dwell times in a globally disconnected state (Rashid et al.,  ). \n\nIn patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, recurring states characterized by high inter-network TVC expressed reduced dwell time and correlated with an early seizure onset (Klugah-Brown et al.,  ). Interestingly, reduced TVC in the ictal irritative zone was associated to an intracranial EEG connectivity increase in the same epileptic region in alpha, beta and gamma bands (Ridley et al.,  ). In patients with Alzheimer's disease, TVC abnormalities between the anterior and the posterior DMN areas correlated with poorer episodic memory performance (Quevenco et al.,  ), while reductions in global TVC were associated with microstructural tissue damage (Alderson et al.,  ). In patients with Parkinson's disease, TVC abnormalities in the DMN have been associated with memory performance (Engels et al.,  ), while TVC alterations in the putamen were associated with clinical disability (Liu et al.,  ). \n\nAt this moment, TVC approaches are applicable only at a group level. However, some preliminary investigations have successfully used TVC abnormalities to classify schizophrenia patients from bipolar patients and/or healthy controls (Cetin et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ), suggesting a future application of TVC at an individual level. \n\n\n\n## Current Limitations and Future Directions \n  \nThe field of TVC is relatively new: all main technical developments have been achieved in the last 9 years. Nonetheless, in such short period of time TVC has provided greater insights into fundamental properties of functional networks, and has improved knowledge of the pathophysiological brain reorganization occurring in MS and other neurological and psychiatric diseases. \n\nHowever, TVC methodology presents some inherent limitations that are likely to be overcome in the next future. Further investigations are also needed to better understand the physiological meaning of TVC fluctuations and their electrophysiological correlates. \n\n### How Reliably Can Time-Varying Fluctuations Be Detected From fMRI Data? \n  \nOne of the main pitfalls of current TVC analysis approaches consists in the fact that the mere presence of signal fluctuations in an fMRI time series is often taken as an evidence of TVC (Hindriks et al.,  ). This might be not necessarily true: FC values fluctuating over time might be observed just because of noise, or statistical uncertainty. Several measures have been employed to test the effective presence of FC variability in fMRI time series, including variance (Sakoglu et al.,  ), standard deviation (Chang and Glover,  ), kurtosis (Laumann et al.,  ), or more complex, non-linear measures (Zalesky et al.,  ). Usually, these metrics are compared between real fMRI data and simulated data, constructed   ad-hoc   to have a static FC. If the test is significant, the null hypothesis of stationarity can be rejected, and TVC can be considered to be effectively present in the data. \n\nResults of studies assessing evidence of TVC in RS fMRI data were quite disappointing, showing that the power of TVC detection in typical 10-min RS fMRI acquisitions was relatively low (Leonardi and Van De Ville,  ; Hindriks et al.,  ; Zhang C. et al.,  ). Solutions to improve the likelihood of detecting TVC might be the choice of appropriate lengths for sliding windows (Leonardi and Van De Ville,  ) or the concatenation of more RS fMRI sessions (Hindriks et al.,  ). On the other hand, it is possible that measures used to test the hypothesis of dynamism so far might be not fully appropriate (Miller et al.,  ). Indeed, novel wavelet-based metrics (Miller et al.,  ) seem to be more sensitive to capture non-stationarities present in real RS fMRI data. \n\n\n### Improving Temporal Resolution of fMRI Acquisitions \n  \nResults of TVC also depend upon the temporal resolution used to acquire fMRI data. TVC studies usually investigate modifications in RS FC occurring within seconds, by using fMRI volumes acquired with TRs ranging from 1 s to 3 s (Chang and Glover,  ; Allen et al.,  ; Cabral et al.,  ; Nini et al.,  ; Yaesoubi et al.,  ; Marusak et al.,  ). Investigations performed on RS fMRI data acquired with a higher sampling rate, e.g., thanks to the use of simultaneous multi-slice imaging techniques, may be more powerful in detecting changing connectivity reconfigurations over time (Choe et al.,  ). Also, the use of ultra-fast fMRI acquisition techniques, such as inverse imaging (Lin et al.,  ), generalized inverse imaging (Boyacioglu and Barth,  ), or multi-slab echo-volumar imaging (Posse et al.,  ), might constitute an important improvement for TVC. Ultra-fast fMRI allows to acquire a single functional volume covering the whole brain in <300 ms, resembling the results of magnetoencephalography studies (Asslander et al.,  ). Therefore, fMRI scans acquired with ultra-fast techniques do not include physiological aliasing and allow the detection of more accurate BOLD signal responses to neural activity. Seminal studies already showed that ultra-fast fMRI significantly enhanced the sensitivity of mapping RS FC dynamics (Posse et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Improving TVC Pre- and Post-processing \n  \nRegardless of the analysis method, the signal-to-noise ratio of the BOLD signal in RS fMRI is low, especially in small temporal segments (Handwerker et al.,  ). Non-neural processes contaminating RS fMRI time series can affect TVC estimates (Hutchison et al.,  ; Murphy et al.,  ; Preti and Van De Ville,  ). These confounds often include the effects of motion, cardiac and respiratory activity, and fluctuations in arterial CO  concentration (Hutchison et al.,  ; Murphy et al.,  ; Nikolaou et al.,  ; Glomb et al.,  ). Global signal regression (GSR) may be useful to better denoise RS fMRI time series (Murphy and Fox,  ); however, it was shown to slightly reduce reliability of the estimated TVC connectivity states (Smith et al.,  ). Moreover, the impact of GSR was spatially heterogeneous across brain regions and was dependent from the amount of global signal magnitude across windows (Xu et al.,  ). As such, caution is suggested in applying GSR to sliding-window correlation analyses, and a control of subjects' mental fluctuations during RS fMRI scanning is recommended (Xu et al.,  ). By applying accurate pre-processing steps on the fMRI data, the rate of artifacts present in the TVC analyses will be minimized (Murphy et al.,  ), thus increasing the quality of the observed findings. \n\nImprovements can still be done not only to pre-processing of RS fMRI time series, but also to TVC post-processing, e.g., by implementing new, accurate methods to estimate changing connectivity over time. Recent papers proposed new approaches to analyse TVC, which aim at capturing change points of connectivity in functional correlation matrices (Cribben et al.,  ; Jeong et al.,  ; Kundu et al.,  ). Other studies introduced tensor-based multilayer community detection algorithms, which are able to describe how organization of functional networks evolves over time (Al-Sharoa et al.,  ). All these methods might be useful to complement TVC information obtained by using more standard, state-of-art methods, such as sliding-window analysis. Finally, improvements can still be done in statistical thresholding strategies. TVC assessment relies on the use of a massive amount of pairwise correlations, stored in series of connectivity matrices, and the best way to perform a proper adjustment for multiple comparisons is still an open issue. Traditional methods of correction for multiple comparisons (Friston et al.,  ) may be too conservative and may suppress all significant results; therefore, different approaches of adjustment for multiple comparisons might be more suitable. For instance, network-based statistic (NBS, Zalesky et al.,  ) was proposed as an alternative method of multiple comparison correction in studies using graph theory, which suffers of similar drawbacks as TVC. NBS has been rarely applied in TVC studies (Diez-Cirarda et al.,  ), probably because the process to construct “components” is not straightforward when connectivity matrices change over time. Future studies investigating new strategies of adjustment for multiple comparisons may propose new solutions for this issue. \n\n\n### Functional Interpretation of TVC Findings \n  \nAlthough some studies have tried to provide a functional interpretation of TVC output, several questions remain to be answered by future work. Preliminary data found some degree of correspondence between EEG rhythms and TVC frequency content (Allen et al.,  ) and hypothesized that some of the TVC states observed in healthy subjects, especially at the end of RS fMRI sessions, might be related to drowsiness or light sleep (Allen et al.,  ,  ). A preliminary study assessing contemporary TVC and EEG registrations confirmed the presence of connectivity changes over different phases of sleep, with long-range temporal dependencies becoming weaker during deep sleep (Tagliazucchi et al.,  ). Still, it is not clear why larger TVC oscillations have been registered in functional networks at the beginning of RS fMRI sessions (Allen et al.,  ,  ). Theories hypothesizing the brain functional “anticipation” (e.g., brain predisposition to switch quickly between different psychological states; Zalesky et al.,  ) might partially explain why more “specialized” functional networks (sensorimotor, auditory, visual) express more constant TVC behavior, while more complex, multi-modal networks express more dynamism. On the other hand, constant TVC oscillations in sensorimotor, auditory and visual networks might only reflect their lower activity during RS (Syed et al.,  ). \n\nFrom this perspective, additional multi-modal studies integrating information from imaging and electrophysiological modalities are necessary for a better comprehension of the neural origin, mechanisms and function of temporal FC variations, as well as of the physiological meaning of TVC states. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe analysis of time-varying FC has contributed to provide significant information on intrinsic brain functional organization, both in healthy and diseased conditions, which complements data produced by static FC approaches. TVC seems to be an intrinsic property of the brain with a neural origin, although some open questions still remain about the correct interpretation of TVC output. \n\nIn MS patients, TVC helped to better understand the pathophysiological functional reorganization occurring in the brain, with a peculiar involvement of the DMN, salience, sensorimotor, and fronto-temporal networks. TVC abnormalities were partially correlated with more severe tissue damage and more severe clinical disability, while more extensive correlations were found with abnormal cognitive performances. In patients with neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, TVC abnormalities of the DMN, attention and executive networks were also associated to stronger clinical manifestations. Overall, these results suggest a maladaptive neuronal response to disease-related damage. \n\nThere are still several unmet needs in neurological and psychiatric conditions that TVC analysis may help to address. First, TVC may be useful to identify multi-modal regions, crucial for functional network plasticity, which may constitute possible targets for motor and cognitive neurorehabilitation protocols, as well as for symptomatic or disease-modifying treatments. Second, trajectories of TVC changes over time during the disease course need to be better defined, both in MS and in psychiatric/other neurodegenerative disorders. This may be the topic of future longitudinal studies, or of cross-sectional studies enrolling patients at different disease phases. Finally, it is still unclear whether TVC abnormalities may have a prognostic value on future disease course. The collection of clinical data at medium- or long-term follow-up may allow to define whether some TVC abnormalities are associated with a more favorable/worse disease prognosis. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nMH wrote the first draft of the manuscript.

However, the molecular mechanisms behind DFC alterations remain largely unknown. Eighty-eight patients with ASDs and 87 demographically matched typical controls (TCs) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II database were included in this study. A seed-based sliding window approach was then performed to investigate the DFC changes in each of the 29 seeds in 10 classic resting-state functional networks and the whole brain. Subsequently, the relationships between DFC alterations in patients with ASDs and their symptom severity were assessed. Finally, transcription-neuroimaging association analyses were conducted to explore the molecular mechanisms of DFC disruptions in patients with ASDs. Compared with TCs, patients with ASDs showed significantly increased DFC between the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left fusiform/lingual gyrus, between the DLPFC and the superior temporal gyrus, between the right frontal eye field (FEF) and left middle frontal gyrus, between the FEF and the right angular gyrus, and between the left intraparietal sulcus and the right middle temporal gyrus. Moreover, significant relationships between DFC alterations and symptom severity were observed. Furthermore, the genes associated with DFC changes in ASDs were identified by performing gene-wise across-sample spatial correlation analysis between gene expression extracted from six donors’ brain of the Allen Human Brain Atlas and case-control DFC difference. In enrichment analysis, these genes were enriched for processes associated with synaptic signaling and voltage-gated ion channels and calcium pathways; also, these genes were highly expressed in autistic disorder, chronic alcoholic intoxication and several disorders related to depression. These results not only demonstrated higher DFC in patients with ASDs but also provided novel insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAutism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social communication defects, stereotyped behaviors and restricted interests or activities ( ). The increasing global prevalence of ASDs in recent years is consistent across different data sources ( ). Neuroimaging techniques have been used to characterize the complex biomarkers of these disorders and a great deal of evidence supports the aberrant functional connectivity (FC) of various cortical networks. However, most previous studies used traditional “static” approaches based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to describe the abnormal FC in individuals with ASDs ( ;  ;  ;  ). An increasing body of evidence suggests that rs-fMRI data are dynamic in essence ( ;  ), and static functional connectivity (SFC) does not clearly show the changes that occur over a short period of time during the scan ( ). It has been proposed that quantifying changes in FC metrics over time may provide greater insight into fundamental properties of brain networks. Recently, researchers have conducted more dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) studies ( ;  ;  ). Briefly, the BOLD signals in rs-fMRI time series were divided into some overlapping intervals, and a functional correlation matrix was derived for each of these intervals. It was possible to track the ongoing changes in FC between brain regions over time ( ;  ). \n\nThere are a few studies investigating DFC in individuals with ASDs. For example,   revealed higher DFC between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and middle temporal pole in patients with ASDs than in typical controls (TCs).   demonstrated increased DFC in the medial superior frontal gyrus and temporal pole in patients with ASDs.   also observed significantly higher DFC between the attention network (AN) and the default mode network (DMN) in patients with ASDs than in TCs. However, these previous studies only performed within or between network DFC analysis, which does not provide comprehensive information on DFC changes in ASDs. Specifically, DFC analysis within a given network only provides a series of relationships between a given region and all other voxels within its network, instead of the full pattern of whole-brain dynamic connections. Likewise, DFC analysis between network only reveals patterns of connectivity between these networks without taking into account internal FC. \n\nRecently, several studies found correlations between DFC and symptom severity, but in the opposite direction.   found that decreased DFC between the PCC and right precentral gyrus was negatively associated with social motivation scores. However,   found that greater DFC was positively related to Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) total score in patients with ASDs.   also found that the increased DFC between the PCC and pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus was positively associated with Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) total raw scores, social awareness and cognition scores. Further exploration of the relationship between DFC and symptom severity may provide more insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of ASDs. \n\nAlthough the recent studies have found atypical DFC in patients with ASDs, questions remain about the genetic mechanisms of higher DFC.   examined the heritability of rs-fMRI data of healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project and found that heritability was moderate and tended to be higher for DFC than for SFC. Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with ASDs have high heritability, twin studies evaluating the heritability of ASDs showed high concordance rates (up to 90%) in monozygotic twins ( ), and common genetic variations account for approximately 50% of the genetic risk for ASDs ( ). In the past few years, transcription-neuroimaging association analyses have emerged as a popular and powerful strategy for investigating the molecular basis of brain imaging phenotypes ( ). To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies using such approach to identify genes related to alterations of brain DFC patterns in patients with ASDs. \n\nIn the current study, rs-fMRI data from Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II (ABIDE II) were used, and 29 core seeds of 10 classic functional networks were selected to perform sliding-window seed-to-whole-brain DFC analyses in a comprehensive manner. Moreover, the relationships between significant DFC changes and symptom severity were further explored in patients with ASDs. Furthermore, transcription-neuroimaging association analyses were conducted to explore the molecular mechanisms of the DFC alterations in patients with ASDs by leveraging the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) database. On the basis of the findings of the previous studies, we hypothesized that: (1) patients with ASDs have significantly increased DFC; (2) there are positive relationship between DFC alterations and severity of symptoms; and (3) there are correlations between DFC alterations and gene expression. An organized workflow diagram of our study is summarized in  . \n  \nThe workflow diagram of this study.

The subject inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) male only, as the prevalence of ASDs has a strong male bias ( ); (2) strong right-handedness; (3) TR = 2 s, for consistency in the temporal scale ( ); (4) younger 18 years old, due to the greater effects of intervention on brain plasticity in children and adolescents ( ;  ); (5) subjects with Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FIQ) within 2 standard deviation (SD) of overall ABIDE sample mean; (6) subjects with mean framewise displacement (FD) ( ) not exceeding 2 SD above the sample mean; (7) availability of both structural and functional images that provide complete whole-brain coverage with successful segmentation, good registration and good image quality; and (8) sites with at least 10 subjects in each group after meeting the above criteria ( ). Finally, 88 patients with ASDs and 87 TCs were included in our study; the number of the subjects excluded due to each of the exclusion criteria is shown in  . The detailed demographic information of each site ( ) and MRI acquisition parameters are summarized in the  . For more information, see  . \n\nThe ADOS is a tool that can be used by clinical doctor to perform a standardized clinical observation of a child ( ), and comprises two behavioral domains: restricted and repetitive behaviors and social affect. The SRS is a parent-report quantitative assessment scale ( ), and designed to evaluate children’s social deficits. SRS provides a total score and separate scores for five subdomains, including social awareness, social cognition, social communication, social motivation, and autistic mannerisms. Separate scores of each domain would provide a clearer picture of ASDs dimensions. These tools offer distinct information from different sources and perspectives ( ), and the complementary information contributed to acquire a comprehensive view of the characteristics of ASDs. The ADOS and SRS scores can be used to assess the severity of symptoms related to ASDs, and higher scores indicate more severe ASD symptoms ( ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Pre-processing \n  \nBoth structural and functional images of all the subjects were examined independently by two researchers, and all images were reoriented to the anterior--posterior commissure line. Functional images were pre-processed using the Data Processing and Analysis for Brain Imaging (DPABI)  toolbox ( ). Specifically, the first five volumes of each subject were removed to allow the signal to reach equilibrium. Slice timing and realignment were then performed to correct the temporal differences between slices and head motion. The mean FD was calculated based on head motion parameters ( ), and subjects with mean FD > 0.5 were excluded (no subjects were excluded in this step). Next, individual structural images were co-registered to the mean motion-corrected functional images, the transformed structural images were segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the motion-corrected functional images were normalized spatially to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the normalization parameters estimated by the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) ( ) tool and resampled to 3 mm cubic voxels. Subsequently, nuisance covariates [including linear trend, Friston-24 head motion parameters ( ) and mean signals from WM and CSF] were regressed out, and temporal bandpass filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz) was applied. Finally, the functional images were spatially smoothed with an 8 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n### Resting State Network Selection and Dynamic Functional Connectivity Calculation \n  \nBased on prior studies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), 29 core seeds within 10 classic brain networks were selected as regions of interest (ROIs) in this study. Specifically, spherical regions with radius of 6 mm centered at the MNI coordinates served as the ROIs. These regions were as follows: (1) the AN: bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) ( ); (2) the central executive network (CEN): bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral posterior parietal cortex ( ); (3) the dorsal attention network (DAN): bilateral frontal eye field (FEF) and bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS) ( ); (4) the DMN: medial prefrontal cortex and PCC ( ); (5) the dorsal visual network: bilateral superior occipital gyrus ( ); (6) the primary visual network: calcarine fissure ( ); (7) the sensorimotor network: bilateral precentral gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus and bilateral supplementary motor area ( ); (8) the salience network: dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral frontoinsular cortex ( ); (9) the ventral attention network: bilateral orbitofrontal cortex and bilateral temporoparietal junction ( ); and (10) the ventral visual network (VVN): calcarine gyri ( ). The detailed MNI coordinates and the spatial distribution of these ROIs are shown in   and  , respectively. \n\nTo calculate the whole-brain resting-state DFC map of each ROI, a widely used sliding-window approach was adopted. First, as suggested by previous studies ( ;  ), a window length of 50 TRs (100 s) and a step size of 1 TR (2 s) were employed to obtain windowed time series. Second, in each window, the whole-brain DFC map for each ROI was created for each subject by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the mean time series of all voxels in the ROI and the time series from all other brain voxels in the GM. Third, Fisher’s   r  -to-  z   transformation was applied for all DFC maps to improve the normality of the correlation distribution. Finally, the SD map across time windows was calculated in each subject to characterize the changes in individual ROI-to-whole-brain DFC, which is a commonly used metric in previous DFC studies ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nA ComBat approach , which can remove intersite variation, preserve biological variability, and is robust to small sample size data, was utilized to harmonize individual DFC maps from the five independent datasets ( ). Subsequently, a voxel-wise general linear model was used to compare the DFC maps of each ROI between the ASDs and TCs groups while controlling for age, FIQ and mean FD. The Gaussian random-field (GRF) method was used to correct for multiple comparisons of the resulting statistical map with significant thresholds of voxel level   p   < 0.001 and cluster level   p   < 0.0017 (0.05/29 ROIs). Furthermore, linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between the DFC from significant clusters of between-group comparison and symptom severity in patients with ASDs with age, FIQ, and mean FD as nuisance covariates. \n\n\n### Gene Expression Data Processing \n  \nGene expression data were obtained from the AHBA. The AHBA comprises the normalized expression data of 20737 genes represented by 58692 probes taken from 3702 brain tissue samples from six donors (one female and five males, aged 24–57 years) ( ). According to the pipeline ( ), the gene expression data preprocessing steps included (1) gene information reannotation, (2) data filtering, (3) probe selection, (4) sample assignment, (5) gene filtering, and (6) accounting for spatial effects. Given that all donors provided tissue samples from the left hemisphere but only two donors provided samples from the right hemisphere, tissue samples from the left hemisphere were used in the following analyses. In addition, consistent with previous studies ( ;  ), we restricted our analyses to the cerebral cortex due to the substantial differences in the gene expression patterns of the cerebral cortex, subcortex, and cerebellum. Finally, we obtained a normalized gene expression matrix of 1285 × 10185 (sample × gene). The detailed pre-processing steps are described in  , and the process of brain tissue samples selection is presented in  . \n\n\n### Transcription-Neuroimaging Association Analysis \n  \nFor each of the   t  -maps that survived from multiple comparisons, the mean   t   value of the spherical region with a 6 mm radius centered at the MNI coordinate of each tissue sample was extracted based on the uncorrected case-control DFC   t  -maps, and the mean   t   value was defined as the ΔDFC of the sample. Then, a gene-wise across-sample spatial correlation was performed to explore the correlation between gene expression and ΔDFC in patients with ASDs. Multiple comparison correction was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) method (  q   < 0.05), and the surviving genes were defined as ΔDFC-related genes. \n\nFunctional annotations of the identified ΔDFC-related genes of each ROI were created with the WEB-based WebGestalt Toolkit ( ) , which includes Gene Ontology (GO) (enriching genes for specific biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions) ( ) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (identifying genes associated with specific biological pathways) databases ( ). In addition, DisGeNET, which contains one of the largest publicly available datasets of genes and variants associated with human diseases ( ), was used to enrich the ΔDFC-related genes for specific neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. The intersection of enriched pathways that the identified ΔDFC-related genes of each ROI for were considered to be stably related to the genetic mechanisms of abnormal DFC patterns in patients with ASDs. \n\n\n### Validation Analyses \n  \nTo verify the robustness of our main findings, we performed the following three experiments. \n\nFirst, we performed validation analyses for different window sizes (30 TRs and 70 TRs). We investigated whether the results (including those of between-group DFC comparisons, DFC-symptom severity associations and ΔDFC-related gene identification) of 50 TRs could be reproducible in other window sizes. \n\nSecond, we calculated the whole-brain resting-state SFC map of each ROI to compare with the DFC results. For each subject, the whole-brain SFC map for each ROI was created by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the mean time series of all voxels in the ROI and the time series from all other brain voxels in the GM. Then, Fisher’s   r  -to-  z   transformation was applied for all SFC maps to improve the normality of the correlation distribution. The subsequent procedures were the same as those mentioned above in the DFC analysis. \n\nThird, although the mean FD was regressed out using general linear model when examining the DFC changes, we could only control the linear effect of the head motion. To further investigate whether the increased DFC is linked to the higher head motion in ASDs, a median split based on FD in both ASD and TC groups was performed and DFC were compared in the subgroups of ASD and TC. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic Information and Clinical Characteristics \n  \nIn this study, 88 patients with ASDs and 87 TCs from 5 research sites met the inclusion criteria. In the ASDs group, 61 subjects had ADOS-2 scores and 69 subjects had SRS scores; In the TCs group, no subject had ADOS-2 scores and 71 subjects had SRS scores. The two groups were matched for age and FIQ. There were significant differences in mean FD, ADOS, and SRS total score and all subscale scores. The detailed demographic and clinical information of the participants is displayed in  . \n  \nDemographic and clinical information of the participants. \n    \n\n### Case-Control Dynamic Functional Connectivity Differences \n  \nWe found that patients with ASDs exhibited significantly increased DFC between the right DLPFC of the CEN and the left fusiform gyrus (FFG)/lingual gyrus (LG), and between the right DLPFC of the CEN and the left STG; significantly increased DFC between the right FEF of the DAN and the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and between the right FEF of the DAN and the right angular gyrus (AG); and significantly increased DFC between the left IPS of the DAN and the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) compared with the TCs [GRF corrected, voxel level   p   < 0.001 and cluster level   p   < 0.0017 (0.05/29 ROIs)] ( ). There was no significantly decreased DFC in the patients with ASDs compared with the TCs. Detailed information on the brain regions with significant ΔDFC in the patients with ASDs is presented in  .

In addition, the DFC of the right DLPFC with the left STG was positively correlated with the SRS social awareness score, social communication score, autism mannerisms score and total scores in the patients with ASDs.

After multiple comparison correction (BH-FDR   q   < 0.05), 6803, 2722, and 1217 genes survived, respectively. Subsequently, gene functional annotation analysis was performed on the ΔDFC-related genes in the three groups. \n\nGene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that the ΔDFC-related genes were significantly enriched for the biological process of neurotransmitter secretion, neurotransmitter transport, the cellular component of ion channel complexes and synaptic membranes, and molecular function of voltage-gated ion channel activity. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the ΔDFC-related genes were significantly enriched in the calcium signaling pathway. In the disease-related enrichment analyses, the ΔDFC-related genes were significantly enriched for autistic disorder, chronic alcoholic intoxication, several disorders related to depression and non-organic psychosis.

We found that the brain regions with significant group differences (50 TRs) in DFC remained significantly different between the ASDs and TCs groups for both 30 TR and 70 TR windows. Moreover, we observed highly similar results in the correlation analyses of the DFC values in areas with significant group differences and symptom severity across the three window sizes. Moreover, the significantly enriched pathways (50 TRs) were largely reproducible for 30 TR and 70 TR windows. Please see the detailed results in  – . We found no significant difference in SFC in the patients with ASDs compared with the TCs. In addition, the direction of effect (higher DFC in ASDs) in these comparisons of subgroups with a median split based on FD was consistent with our main results (  and  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we assessed the DFC alterations among the 29 core seeds of 10 classic resting-state networks and the whole brain in patients with ASDs compared with TCs and calculated the correlation between the DFC values in areas with significant group differences and symptom severity in patients with ASDs. In patients with ASDs, we observed significantly increased DFC between the right DLPFC (the core seed of the CEN) and the left FFG/LG, between the right DLPFC and the left STG; between the right FEF (the core seed of the DAN) and the left MFG, between the right FEF and the right AG, and between the left IPS (the core seed of the DAN) and the right MTG. \n\nHigh DFC could lead to the instability of information transfer within and between networks ( ). The DLPFC is a core region in the CEN and is responsible for subjective feelings, self-awareness, emotion regulation, working memory, executive functions and the judgment and decision making under goal-directed behavior ( ;  ;  ). The FFG and LG are key regions in the VVN that are associated with visual item identification, such as face recognition, memory for visual item identity and planning a response to potentially threatening stimuli ( ;  ;  ). The increased DFC between the CEN and VVN may be related to the loss of emotional regulation and social interaction impairment in patients with ASDs ( ;  ). The MFG is also a core region in the CEN and is mainly responsible for integrating and processing information ( ;  ). Previous studies have suggested that individuals with ASDs are unable to integrate and process information; therefore, they cannot communicate normally with others ( ). We speculated that the increased DFC between the CEN and DAN may be associated with communication defects in patients with ASDs. \n\nFrontal eye field and IPS are core regions in the DAN that are involved in mediating many higher-order cognitive tasks and supporting top-down attention to visual, auditory and somatosensory inputs ( ;  ;  ;  ). The AG is an important part of the DMN, which is implicated in social cognition and affective regulation associated with empathic responses ( ,  ;  ). The increased DFC between the DAN and DMN might lead to deficits in attention switching and cognitive function in patients with ASDs ( ;  ). The STG and MTG are crucial regions in the AN that are associated with auditory language, visual language and emotion ( ;  ;  ). The increased DFC between the CEN/DAN and AN may be related to social interaction impairment in patients with ASDs. Similar to our findings, some studies observed no significant difference in SFC between the ASDs and TCs groups ( ;  ). No significant difference has been observed in the SFC analyses, which is partially because DFC can capture the time-varying properties and seems to be more sensitive than SFC ( ). \n\nIn the correlation analyses between the DFC and symptom severity in patients with ASDs, we observed positive correlations between the DFC of the right DLPFC (core seed of the CEN) and the left STG (core seed of the AN) and ADOS-2 calibrated severity total score. ASDs is characterized by socio-communicational deficits and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Higher severity total score indicates more severe ASDs symptoms. Functional alterations of CEN have previously been reported in ASDs ( ). Alterations of the AN in ASDs are associated with the severity of autistic core symptom ( ). The AN is mainly involved with lower-level perception ( ). The CEN controls attention, integrates the information processed in the other networks and plays a central role in various cognitive functions ( ;  ). The higher DFC between the DLPFC and STG could cause unstable transmission and impaired coupling between these brain regions. In addition, underconnectivity theory proposes that both the two core symptoms of ASDs are associated with impairment of integration of global information ( ;  ). Therefore, the higher DFC between the DLPFC and STG observed in our study might cause the more severe ASDs symptoms. \n\nAdditionally, we observed a positive correlation between the DFC of the right DLPFC with the left STG and with the patients’ SRS social awareness score, social communication score, autism mannerisms score and total score. We also revealed a positive correlation between the DFC of the right FEF with the left MFG and with the patients’ SRS social awareness score, social communication score and total score. Social awareness contributes to one’s ability to recognize and understand the thinking or feeling of others ( ), social communication is one’s capability to respond appropriately to what others interpret ( ), and autism mannerisms describe a collection of stereotypical behaviors or restricted interests ( ). The higher DFC between the DLPFC (core seed of the CEN) and STG (core seed of the AN) indicated unstable information transmission ( ) and might influence auditory attention, semantic fluency, the learning of social cues and the integration of appropriate social responses. Furthermore, we found that the DFC between the right FEF (core seed of the DAN) and the left MFG (key region of the CEN) was positively correlated with the SRS social awareness score, social communication score and total score. Both the CEN and DAN are involved in cognitive regulation and may be related to social awareness. Individuals with ASDs cannot communicate normally with others due to deficits in integrating and processing information, and the MFG is mainly responsible for integrating and processing information ( ;  ). This important detail may explain the positive correlation among the DFC of the right FEF-left MFG, the patient’s SRS social awareness score, and the patient’s communication score. \n\nOverall, the ΔDFC-related genes were mainly enriched for voltage-gated ion channels, especially calcium and potassium channels, synaptic membranes and the related processes involved in the release and transmission of neurotransmitters. Voltage-gated ion channels are important mediators of physiological functions in the central nervous system. Activation of these channels influences neurotransmitter release, neuronal excitability, gene transcription, and plasticity. Ion channels, especially polymorphisms in calcium and potassium channels, are related to the pathogenesis of ASDs ( ). Moreover, calcium signaling is ubiquitously involved in the process of neuronal excitability, neurotransmitter release and cell secretion ( ). Genetic mutations related to the calcium signaling pathway can elevate the risk of developing ASDs ( ). Membrane proteins are significant components of the proteins in cells and play a key role in synaptic transmission; also, disruption of synaptic membrane components may influence synaptic signaling transmission ( ). Abnormalities in synapse formation, which contribute to functional and cognitive impairments, play a vital role in the pathological mechanism of ASDs ( ). Neurotransmitters can transmit nerve impulses from neurons to other cells. Neurotransmitter transport dysfunction can affect the transmission and absorption of neurotransmitters ( ), and abnormalities in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission may be connected with the etiology of ASDs ( ). \n\nIn the disease-related enrichment analyses, the ΔDFC-related genes were enriched for autistic disorder, chronic alcoholic intoxication, several disorders related to depression and non-organic psychosis. Upon initiation of alcohol use, individuals with ASDs were at higher risk for developing alcohol dependence ( ). Studies have shown an increased risk for depression symptoms in children and adolescents with ASDs who had various IQs ( ). Individuals with ASDs are associated with a substantially increased risk for non-affective psychotic disorder (NAPD) and bipolar disorder; notably, non-organic psychosis was the most commonly diagnosed subtype of NAPD among individuals with ASDs ( ). Deficits in social interactions and emotion regulation in individuals with ASDs may be associated with elevated rates of psychiatric comorbidity ( ;  ). \n\nSeveral limitations should be considered in this study. First, compared with single-site studies, the use of multicenter public imaging data in this study may have involved some issues associated with scanner differences and inconsistency assessments. Second, head motion was a confounding factor in DFC analyses. To reduce this effect, we carried out a series of procedures, including regressing 24 head motion parameters in the data pre-processing, and controlling for mean FD in group-comparisons ( ). However, the effect of motion cannot be completely ruled out. In the future, it would be better to recruit subjects with matched head motion to replicate the findings. Third, although many dynamic metrics could be used to investigate DFC, we employed SD of FC values across time windows to characterize DFC because it was difficult to calculate other dynamic metrics due to the highly computational burden. Further study is needed to calculate other dynamic metrics of seed-based voxel-level DFC by using high-performance computing systems. Fourth, the results about the genes expressed in autistic disorder, chronic alcoholic intoxication and disorders related to depression were obtained from the disease enrichment analysis, the detailed information about these conditions of the autism patients included in our study was not provided by ABIDE database. Fifth, we did not include female subjects or investigate the sex-related effects in this study due to the highly male-biased sex ratios in ABIDE. Sixth, the weaker associations between DFC and symptom severity in patients with ASDs may be related to the relatively small sample size. Seventh, the average   t  -statistics were extracted around the location of AHBA tissue samples; however, the uneven spatial distribution of tissue samples in the AHBA may influence our results. Finally, in our study, the imaging and gene expression data were not derived from the same subjects. However, many studies have confirmed that genes involved in the regulation of transcription and development across human populations are highly conserved ( ;  ); therefore, our results of transcription-neuroimaging association studies should be reliable. \n\nIn conclusion, the patients with ASDs showed increased DFC in brain areas related to attentional and cognitive regulation, which were associated with symptom severity. Transcription-neuroimaging association analyses identified ΔDFC-related genes, especially those involved in processes associated with synaptic signaling, voltage-gated ion channels, neurotransmitter secretion and transport. These findings provide more insight into the polygenetic and multipathway molecular mechanisms of functional impairments in patients with ASDs. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nEthical review and approval were not required for the current study in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements.

Although previous studies have found abnormal functional connectivities in patients with WMHs based on static functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the topological properties in the context of brain dynamics remain relatively unexplored. Herein, we explored disrupted dynamic topological properties of functional network connectivity in patients with WMHs and its relationship with cognitive impairment. We included 36 healthy controls (HC) and 104 patients with mild WMHs (  n   = 39), moderate WMHs (  n   = 37), and severe (  n   = 28) WMHs. The fMRI data of all participants were analyzed using Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) and a sliding-window approach to generate dynamic functional connectivity matrics. Then, graph theory methods were applied to calculate the topological properties. Comprehensive neuropsychological scales were used to assess cognitive functions. Relationships between cognitive functions and abnormal dynamic topological properties were evaluated by Pearson’s correlation. We found that the patients with WMHs had higher temporal variability in regional properties, including betweenness centrality, nodal efficiencies, and nodal clustering coefficient. Furthermore, we found that the degree of centrality was related to executive function and memory, and the local coefficient correlated to executive function. Our results indicate that patients with WMHs have higher temporal variabilities in regional properties and are associated with executive and memory function. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nCerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) arising from disrupted cerebral microvessels is a leading factor in dementia, present in up to 45% of patients [ ]. White matter hyperintensities (WMHs), subcortical infarcts, enlarged perivascular space, and microbleeds have been considered common neuroimaging manifestations of CSVD [ ], among which the detection rate of WMHs is as high as 72~96% in older adults [ ]. Moreover, the increased volume of WMHs and deterioration of white matter microstructure are perceived as predictors of progression to dementia [ ]. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that white matter damage mainly involves cognitive impairments in global cognitive function, information processing speed, and executive function [ ]. Previous studies have explored the neural mechanisms by which white matter lesions lead to impaired fibril connections and have ignored the fact that non-contiguous brain regions can transmit information. Therefore, previous studies have shown only part of the mechanism of cognitive impairments. \n\nFunctional connectivity is viewed as the synchronous activation of blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal observed by the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [ ]. Numerous pieces of evidence have indicated that the patients with WMHs consisted of within- and between-functional connectivity alterations, which are related to disrupted communication and cognition impairments [ , ]. Graph-theory-based analysis has provided an advanced insight into how WMHs give rise to cognitive impairments through exploring functional brain networks in terms of global properties, such as small-worldness, as well as regional properties, such as the coefficient and nodal degree [ ]. Some studies have suggested that the topological properties of functional brain networks in patients with WMHs present increased path length and decreased small-worldness, which influence cognition impairments [ , ]. \n\nHowever, the majority of studies based on static fMRI lacked the exploration of topological properties in the context of brain dynamics. Compared to traditional static functional connectivities (sFC), which is based on the assumption that functional connectivities (FC) patterns are unchanged during scanning, dynamic FC(dFC) can capture temporal changes and thus provide complementary insights into changes in functional brain networks [ ]. A graph-theory-based approach applied to dynamic functional connectivity showed that topological dynamical variability in brain networks might offer new insights into the underlying nature of neurodegenerative diseases. For example, the dynamic topological properties of connectivity networks contribute to the assessment of Alzheimer’s disease progression [ ] and its prodrome, mild cognitive impairment [ ]. Moreover, in schizophrenia, reduced variability in local and global network efficiency is associated with clinical symptoms [ ]. Herein, the alteration of dynamic topological properties may provide a novel perspective on cognitive impairments that cannot be detected from sFC. \n\nIn this study, we applied widely used automated anatomical labeling (AAL-90) [ ] and the sliding window approach to calculate the FC matrix of continuous-time series [ ]. Then, the graph-theory method is applied to generate the topological organization of whole-brain connectivity networks and determine differences in topological properties among healthy controls (HCs) and patients with WMHs. Moreover, comprehensive neuropsychological scales were used to assess cognitive function in multiple cognitive domains in patients with WMHs. We hypothesized that patients with WMHs would show increased dynamic regional topological properties, which may be associated with cognitive impairments. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nWe recruited 104 right-handed patients from the Department of Neurology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. The inclusion criteria were: (1) had macroscopic CSVD-related WMHs upon T2-FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); (2) were in the age range of 40 to 80 years old. We did not include patients who were not suitable for MRI scanning or were unable to complete neuropsychological tests (hearing or visual impairments, language or physical movement disorders, etc.). We excluded patients with a history of alcohol addiction, psychiatric disorders, or tumors. Patients who were suspected of having experienced a cardiogenic stroke or with intracranial/extracranial stenosis > 50% or intracranial hemorrhage were also excluded. \n\nThen, patients were divided into three categories according to their Fazekas score: mild WMHs (Fazekas score 1–2;   n   = 39), moderate WMHs (Fazekas score 3–4;   n   = 37), and severe WMHs (Fazekas score 5–6;   n   = 28). The Fazekas score was assessed by a professional neurologist based on the Fazekas scale [ ]. Thirty-six HCs were recruited according to the exclusion criteria described above and matched to patients with WMHs in terms of age, sex, and years of education. \n\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Anhui Medical University. The work described in this article was carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans, as well as the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. Prior to data collection, informed consent was obtained from all participants. \n\n\n### 2.2. Volume of WMHs \n  \nThe UBO segmentation algorithm was selected to extract the WMH volume ( ), which was accessed on 20 September 2021 [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.3. Neuropsychological Assessment \n  \nA neuropsychological test battery tested for differences in emotional and cognitive performance between groups. The emotional tests included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [ ] and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) [ ]. General cognitive function was evaluated by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) [ ], while executive, language, and memory functions were estimated by using the Trail Making Test (TMT), including TMT-A and TMT-B [ ], Boston Naming Test (BNT) [ ], and Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) which contain AVLT-study, AVLT-immediate, AVLT-delay, and AVLT-recognition, respectively [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.4. MRI Parameters \n  \nMRI data were collected by using a GE750w 3.0T MRI system (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) at the University of Science and Technology of China. During scanning, participants were instructed to close their eyes, and foam pads were used to minimize head motion. The parameters of acquired sequences were set as follows: \n\nT2 FLAIR: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)/inversion time (TI)/flip angle = 8000 ms/165 ms/2000 ms/111°; size of acquisition matrix = 512 × 512; FOV = 256 × 256 mm ; 20 continuous slices (thickness = 5 mm with gap = 1 mm); run time = 1 min and 37 s. \n\nStructural, 3D, T1-weighted imaging were set as follows: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)/flip angle = 8.16 ms/3.18 ms/12°; number of continuous slices = 188 (thickness = 1 mm with no gap, and voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm ); and field of view (FOV) = 256 × 256 mm ; run time = 4 min and 43 s. \n\nRs-fMRI: TR/TE/flip angle = 2400 ms/30 ms/90°; size of acquisition matrix = 64 × 64; FOV = 192 × 192 mm ; 46 continuous slices (thickness = 3 mm with no gap, and voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm ); run time = 8 min and 41 s. \n\nEnhanced gradient echo T2 star-weighted angiography (ESWAN): TR/TE/flip angle = 52.189 ms/2.856 ms/12°; matrix size = 256 × 256, FOV = 220 × 220 mm ; slice thickness = 2 mm with no gap; run time = 5 min and 22 s. \n\n\n### 2.5. fMRI Data Processing \n  \nfMRI images of all participants were preprocessed by DPABI toolbox ( ) [ ] and SPM12 software ( ), which were accessed on 20 September 2021. The first 10 time points were discarded, and the remaining images were used for slice timing and realignment. Head motions were quality-controlled (no more than 3° of rotation or 3 mm of translation in any dimension) during MRI scanning, so no data were discarded. The eligible images were co-registered with functional images and segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [ ]. Then, the data were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Following steps were used to detrend linear regressing covariates (24 head motion parameters, WM and CSF signals) and temporal filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz) [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.6. Temporal Network Construction \n  \nBased on Dynamic BC toolbox, a sliding-window approach was used to explore the time-varying changes of 90 × 90 pairwise FC matrix by Pearson’s correlations within the nodes clarified by AAL-90 [ , ]. The sliding-windows approach was used to divide the BOLD signal time series, which were extracted from a region of interest (ROI). In this study, the brain was parcellated into 90 ROIs based on the widely used AAL. Then, taking the brain region of interest as the node, we computed the 90 × 90 pairwise functional connectivity matrixes by Pearson’s correlation in individuals’ windows of time series. Based on previous literature recommendations, the time series of MRI scanning was divided into 32 windows (50-TR window = 120 s with 5-TR step size = 12 s) to maintain the stability of functional connectivities and reduce the computational complexity of topological properties [ ]. The value of Pearson’s correlations were transformed into z-values by Fisher’s z-transformation. \n\n\n### 2.7. Dynamic Topological Properties \n  \nGiven that there is no definite value of network threshold in graph theory analysis, individually obtained temporal FC matrix was converted to binary format with a sparsity threshold of 0.05~0.5 instead of selecting a certain threshold. The definition of sparsity is defined as the ratio of the practical number of existing edges to the maximum possible number of connected edges. Hence, a wide range of sparsity thresholds presented overall value and better estimated the strength of functional connectivities. The negative correlation suggests that these brain regions simply do not form a network and therefore are not considered. Based on GRETNA toolbox ( ) [ ], which was accessed on 21 September 2021, at every sparsity threshold, we applied the graph theory to calculate both global and regional properties in each FC matrix of all sliding windows [ ]. In our study, the brain was divided into 90 regions based on AAL, where individual regions were defined as functionally independent nodes and the FC between pairs of regions as edges. Then, we calculated the variance of individual global and regional properties across all sliding windows to obtain a variance value to estimate the variability of topological properties over time, which was further used to test the dynamic topological property differences between groups. The relevant operation steps are illustrated in  . A small-world network means preferable communication between the nodes in the network. The nodal properties we focused on were degree centrality, betweenness centrality, the nodal clustering coefficient, and nodal efficiency [ , ]. The definition of these topological properties is presented in the  . \n\n\n### 2.8. Statistical Analysis \n  \nDemographic and neuropsychological data were analyzed by using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). One-way analysis of variance was used to assess differences in age, years of education, and neuropsychological test scores, and the chi-square test was used to determine differences in sex, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking history, and drinking history among groups (statistically significant at   p   < 0.05). At the same time, one-way analysis of variance and post hoc analysis were performed for cognition performance among the three WMH groups. The dynamic topological property differences between groups were assessed by one-way analysis of variance (age, sex, and years of education were used as the calibration control variables) and false discovery rate (FDR) correction (statistically significant at a corrected   p   < 0.05). We investigated the relationship between network properties and neuropsychological tests by performing a Pearson’s correlation test and FDR correction (statistically significant at a corrected   p   < 0.05). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Demographics, Risk Factors, and Neuropsychological Test Results \n  \nThere were no significant differences in age, sex, or years of education between these groups ( ). Compared with HC, patients with WMHs not only showed poor performance in global cognitive function but also in executive, language, and memory functions ( ). Moreover, there were significant differences between the three WMH groups ( ), especially in TMT-A and TMT-B. \n\n\n### 3.2. Dynamic Topological Properties \n  \nThere were no significant differences in small-world properties between the HC and three WMH groups. However, there were significant differences in the variability of nodal properties (FDR corrected   p   < 0.05) between the four groups. The betweenness centrality differed among the four groups in bilateral rectus gyri, right inferior occipital lobe, right paracentral lobule, right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus, and left orbital part of the superior frontal gyrus ( ). Nodal efficiencies were altered in the bilateral rolandic opercula (ROL), as well as in the right superior frontal gyrus, right medial orbital part of the superior frontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, and left postcentral gyrus ( ). The nodal clustering coefficient exhibited high variability in bilateral cunei and medial orbital parts of both superior frontal gyrus, as well as in the right superior occipital gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, right inferior occipital lobe, left superior frontal gyrus, and left supramarginal gyrus (SMG) ( ). \n\n\n### 3.3. Relationship between Network Properties and Cognitive Function \n  \nCorrelation analysis revealed that as the temporal variability of the nodal cluster coefficient increased in the left SMG, the TMT-A time gradually increased (r = 0.272, FDR corrected   p   = 0.05) and the AVLT-study score gradually decreased (r = −0.247, FDR corrected   p   = 0.042) in patients with WMHs ( ). Moreover, as the nodal efficiency of the left rolandic operculum increased, the MoCA score gradually decreased (r = −0.281, FDR corrected   p   = 0.012), the TMT-A time gradually increased (r = 0.346, FDR corrected   p   = 0.005), and the TMT-B time gradually increased (r = 0.315, FDR corrected   p   = 0.008) in patients with WMHs ( ). \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn this study, the sliding window and graph theory approaches were combined for the identification of alterations in the dynamic topological properties of patients with WMHs. We discovered that patients with WMHs exhibited higher temporal variability than HC in nodal properties, particularly in the superior frontal gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), which belong to the cognitive control network (CCN) and default mode network (DMN) [ ], but that small-world property did not differ between these groups. Furthermore, altered nodal characteristics were strongly associated with cognitive impairment in patients with WMHs. \n\nGenerally, dynamic topological organizations based on fMRI reflect the spatiotemporal volatility of information among brain regions that occurs in continuous sliding windows. Thus, the higher temporal variability of the nodal properties of these regions in patients with WMHs compared to HC in our study suggests asynchronicity in their information transmission with other brain regions. The functional connections in the brain networks influence each other at the spatiotemporal level, and intricate brain functions depend on integration and separation among functionally specialized neural circuits [ ]. Asynchronicity of the brain regions may impede the transmission of information within and/or between brain networks [ ]. Conceptually, temporal nodal properties are commonly measured in terms of localized temporal information transmission. Nodal properties refer to the degree of information transmission to other nodes or fault tolerance of a priority node in the subnetwork [ ]. Similarly, our results indicated that patients with WMHs exhibited higher temporal variability than HC in terms of nodal properties, particularly in the superior frontal gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), which belong to the CCN and DMN [ ]. Thus, it seems that higher variability in the dynamic nodal properties of the brain networks reduces their anatomical constraints, and spatially distant functional connections to these pivotal brain regions may lead to further cognitive impairments. However, the small-world property did not differ between these groups. The small-worldness metric σ illustrates this relationship using data from multiple networks [ ] may not be as sensitive to changes in global small-worldness. The network presented in this work is relatively small (  n   = 90) in a regime where σ may be close to its critical value of 1. Because of this, the dynamic variability in small-worldness may not be sufficient to detect differences associated with WMH burden. Moreover, the small world is a stable topology, so it is not prone to present temporal variability in a relatively short period. Moreover, some dynamic topological properties are only produced in the group with severe WMHs. It may be that although the topological structure of patients with mild-to-moderate WMHs changes during the scan, the dispersion of the changes is not large and is still within the compensation range. Thus, it is not that different from the dynamic change in HC. This is consistent with the lack of between-group differences in the small-world property. \n\nFurthermore, we discovered that variation in dynamic nodal topological organizations mainly occurred in the CCN and DMN and was closely associated with executive and memory function in patients with WMHs, which was mainly observed in SMG and ROL. The SMG resides in the inferior parietal lobule and is a node of the DMN, establishing complex functional connections between different networks for the regulation of executive functions [ ]. Moreover, the SMG can regulate bottom-up attentional orienting and memory retrieval [ ]. The rolandic operculum, regarded as the main node of the CCN, mediates the encoding and extraction of memories [ ] and is involved in information processing speed [ ], which is a key subdomain of cognitive function and is now commonly treated as a pivotal diagnostic indicator for neurocognitive disorders [ ]. \n\nTherefore, higher fluctuations in the dynamic brain networks may result in a disconnect among information processing systems [ ]. This is also consistent with patients with WMHs showing impaired executive function and memory abilities [ ]. From the perspective of dFC, our study further complements the findings of previous sFC studies that cognitive impairment is associated with impaired node properties [ ]. \n\nSome limitations that may affect the results should be taken into account. First, in this study, our study sample was small; therefore, the results should be considered preliminary, and causality remains to be determined with larger samples and long-term follow-up studies. Second, a further multicenter study should be considered to minimize the influence of regional cultural differences on cognitive performance in a simple cross-sectional study. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, our results indicate that the patients with WMHs had higher temporal variability in regional properties, including betweenness centrality, nodal efficiencies, and nodal clustering coefficient. Furthermore, most of the variable nodal properties are located within the DMN and CCN and are associated with executive and memory functions. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"410ef18d6ff3b1f3b7e1bd3099a8bdcb"},

We performed a dynamic functional connectivity analysis using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) in 14 patients before and during a propofol infusion to characterize the sedation-induced alterations in consciousness. A sliding 36-second window was used to derive 59 time points of whole brain integrated local connectivity measurements. Significant changes in the connectivity strength (Z Corr) at various time points were used to measure the connectivity fluctuations during awake and sedated states. Compared with the awake state, sedation was associated with reduced cortical connectivity fluctuations in several areas connected to the default mode network and around the perirolandic cortex with a significantly decreased correlation of connectivity between their anatomical homologues. In addition, sedation was associated with increased connectivity fluctuations in the frequency range of 0.027 to 0.063 Hz in several deep nuclear regions, including the cerebellum, thalamus, basal ganglia and insula. These findings advance our understanding of sedation-induced altered consciousness by visualizing the altered dynamics in several cortical and subcortical regions and support the concept of defining consciousness as a dynamic and integrated network. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nHuman consciousness is an enigma, and states of reversible loss of consciousness are useful channels to unravel this mystery. Understanding the neurobiological basis of sedation has, thus, captured the interest of many scholars, and studies using resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) have provided important but contradictory evidence of increased , decreased  or heterogenous connectivity . The discrepancy in the results could be partially due to the varying analysis techniques, and the majority of studies have used hypothesis driven techniques, such as region of interest (ROI) and seed to voxel analyses , that focus on a default mode network (DMN) and a sensorimotor network; some studies have used data driven global (independent component analysis (ICA)) , local (integrated local connectivity (ILC))  and intrinsic connectivity contrast (ICC)  connectivity measures. The levels of sedation are also known to alter functional connectivity, and lower sedation levels (Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scores (OAAS) 3 and above) are linked to an increased somatosensory cortical connectivity , while deeper levels of sedation (OAAS 3 and below) are linked to a decrease cortical connectivity . Several multistage studies exploring awake, sedated, unconscious and recovery states have captured the dynamic changes in connectivity during the loss and recovery of consciousness . One of the major limitations of these connectivity methods is that the measurement is averaged over the data acquisition duration and, hence, does not consider the fluctuations or variability in the system. \n\nAccording to a large scale dynamic model of consciousness , human consciousness is not static and exists at the verge of instability between a multi-stable attractor state and an unstable spontaneous state . This state of instability is considered essential as it assumes that the system is periodically monitoring and is maximally sensitive to any external stimulus . Experimental investigations of consciousness also reveal a dynamic state of connectivity between several networks , particularly those involving the parietal and frontal cortices . Dynamic connectivity (DC) rsfMRI analysis  is a novel technique that uses sliding temporal windows to yield continuous series of connectivity snap shots that can be used to characterize the temporal evolution of networks. This technique has been used extensively in rsfMRI in both humans and animals  and  has been applied to characterize disease states, such as epilepsy , Alzheimer’s disease , schizophrenia  and task performance . \n\nThere is increasing evidence that the information obtained using static and dynamic methods is different, and static connectivity measures are more dependent on the structural anatomy and dynamic connectivity (DC), which is a phenomenon that is independent of the brain structure . A recent DC study exploring propofol-induced loss of consciousness in rats reported a substantial reduction in the temporal variance in brain connectivity during sedation . Another dynamic connectivity analysis using a spatial co-activation pattern (CAP), which measures connectivity dynamics during supra-threshold time periods, has also found reduced dynamics during sedation . \n\nBased on this dynamic concept of connectivity, we re-analysed previously acquired data  during awake and sedated states in patients with low backache undergoing imaging under IV propofol sedation using DC. Our hypothesis stated that the sedation-state will have significantly reduced connectivity fluctuations compared to the awake-state based on evidence from previous studies. To measure the dynamic local connectivity (DLC), a 36 second time window was established to “slide” through the entire data, and a Fisher’s Z transformed ILC map was derived for each window. These maps were compared between conditions and averaged across windows to derive areas that revealed significant changes with sedation. Beta values, which are a measure of the connectivity strength, were calculated from each sliding window, and their fluctuations  were measured. The between-region correlation and multiband frequency analysis were also performed to further characterize the temporal covariance and frequency specificity of these fluctuations. This study has enabled us to capture the dynamics of the resting brain under sedation and used fMRI to validate theoretical models of consciousness. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn total, 14 patients (M:F, 8:6; mean age 46.9 ± 11.3 years) successfully completed both the baseline awake and sedated state fMRI imaging. No patient required an alteration in the dose of the propofol infusion (1.5 mg/kg/hour) during the fMRI acquisition to achieve and maintain the desired clinical end-point-modified Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAAS) score of 3 to 2. The changes in the cardiovascular (heart rate and mean BP) and respiratory parameters (SpO  and ETCO ) during the imaging period (baseline and sedated state) were not significantly different (p > 0.05) according to the repeated-measures ANOVA analysis, minimizing the possible effect of these parameters on the BOLD signal changes. \n\nCompared with the baseline, the sedated state was characterized by a diffuse decreased cortical connectivity along with increased deep nuclear DLC fluctuations as demonstrated in Fig.  .   \nDynamic functional connectivity during the awake state, sedation and the differences between two conditions is depicted in rows. Seven representative snap shots of integrated local correlation at sliding window 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 59 is shown overlapped on BrainNet viewer images. Decreased cortical connectivity is represented in blue and increased deep nuclear connectivity is depicted in red in the last row which represents the effects of sedation. \n  \n\n### Dynamic Local connectivity analysis \n  \nAmong all the voxels evaluated, the regions that revealed the most significant (FDR P < 0.05) connectivity changes during sedation are shown in Fig.   and Table  . The cortical regions included components of the DMN (posterior cingulate cortex {PCC}, pre-cuneus, angular and left middle temporal gyrus), perirolandic regions (right pre- and post-central and bilateral supplementary motor cortex), right middle frontal gyrus, right supra-marginal gyrus, and crus 1 and 2 of the left cerebellum. In addition, the cerebellar (bilateral cerebellum 4 and 5 and vermis 4 and 5), right diencephalic (thalamus) and basal ganglionic (putamen and insula) structures revealed increased connections during sedation.   \nWhole brain group mean image of dynamic functional connectivity maps during the awake state, sedation and the differences between two conditions. The regions which showed significant decreased connectivity prominently involving the default mode network and peri-rolandic regions is represented in blue and the regions with increased connectivity involving cerebellum, thalamus and basal ganglia is depicted in red in the last column which depicts effects of sedation. \n    \nRegions revealing significant DLC differences between awake and sedation state. \n  \nThe t-values represent the strength of ILC connectivity between the voxel and its neighboring correlated voxels. Cluster size represents the number of voxels correlated in the brain region. The p-value represents the corrected significance level of the ILC connectivity. \n  \n\nTo visualize the temporal connectivity fluctuations in the regions that revealed significant sedation-induced differences, the mean and standard deviation of the beta values obtained from each sliding window were plotted and are depicted in Figs   and  . As shown in Fig.  , the cortical regions revealed a significant reduction in the standard deviation of the connectivity between sliding windows, i.e. connectivity fluctuations. Some areas, such as the right angular, post- and pre-central gyrus, demonstrated an almost straight-line trend with hardly any fluctuations during sedation. The pre-cuneus, bilateral supplementary motor cortex and left middle temporal gyrus had reduced connectivity with some fluctuations, but notably, these fluctuations never touched the zero line.   \nConnectivity fluctuations. Six representative cortical regions which revealed decreased dynamic functional connectivity (DLC) during sedation is presented. The strength of the Z correlation on the Y-axis is plotted across the sliding window time points from 1 to 59 on the X-axis. The DLC at baseline is depicted in green and during sedation is shown in red. The bar graph in the inset reveals the standard deviations (SD) in the Z correlation strengths during the two conditions. Significant sedation-induced decrease in connectivity of the cortical regions involving the default mode network and the peri-rolandic regions with decreased SD indicating decreased fluctuations. \n    \nConnectivity fluctuations. Six representative deep nuclear and cerebellar regions which revealed an increased dynamic functional connectivity (DLC) during sedation is presented. The strength of the Z correlation on the Y-axis is plotted across the sliding window time points from 1 to 59 on the X-axis. The DLC during baseline awake state is depicted in green and during the sedated state is shown in red. The bar graph in the inset reveals the standard deviations (SD) in the Z correlation strengths during the two conditions. Significant sedation-induced increased connectivity involving the thalamus, basal ganglia and cerebellum with an increased SD demonstrating a “pulsatile” pattern with intermittent periods touching the zero line is most prominent in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and insula. \n  \n\nIn contrast, the deep-seated regions (Fig.  ) revealed an increase in the connectivity strength, which is unlike the pattern observed in the cortical regions. This pattern had transient periods of increased connectivity intermixed with time points of very low connectivity, which touched the zero line at frequent intervals. This pattern was most clearly observed in the right cerebellum and putamen. \n\n\n### Synchrony of the fluctuations \n  \nSince there were two distinct patterns in the DLC fluctuations visually, we were interested in determining whether these fluctuations could be interlinked. Therefore, we performed a Pearson’s correlation analysis of the DLC connectivity between the abovementioned areas (Fig.  ). We found that there was a significant positive correlation between the anatomical homologues within the DMN and around the perirolandic motor region at baseline (Fig.  ). During sedation, the correlations among these regions were reduced. However, the connections within the cerebellar homologues that had fewer correlations at baseline had increased connectivity correlations during sedation (Fig.  ). Several regions in the cerebellum and thalamus had increased correlations with several components of the DMN during sedation. These results indicate that during sedation, there appears to be a decreased connectivity correlation in homologous regions of the DMN and perirolandic area, and concurrently, there are increased correlations in the cerebellum and from the cerebellum and thalamus to the DMN.   \nCorrelation of the connectivity of the 17 areas which revealed significant changes during sedation. Baseline state (  a  ) reveals significant (white stars) correlation of connection between right pre-central, post-central, and bilateral supplementary motor cortex. During sedation (  b  ) only significant connection in the peri-rolandic region was between right pre-and post-central gyrus. Similar changes are also appreciable in the subcomponents of DMN (precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), angular gyrus, and left mid-temporal region). Significantly increased connectivity of the bilateral cerebellum, vermis, and of thalamus and PCC during sedation (  b  ) probably indicates re-organisation of these regions. \n  \n\n\n### Multiband functional connectivity analysis \n  \nWe subdivided the entire low frequency (LF) range into four equal but arbitrary divisions (LF1{0.027 to 0.045 Hz}, LF2 {0.046 to 0.063 Hz}, LF3 {0.064 to 0.081 Hz} and LF4 {0.082 to 0.1 Hz}) and reanalysed the differences in the DLC in each frequency bands because the functional connectivity between and within different regions of the brain could be frequency-specific . We used bandpass filtering in the CONN toolbox to derive these groups  because we were particularly interested in characterizing the contrasting changes in the temporal connectivity fluctuation patterns in the cortical and deep nuclear regions. We found that the deep nuclear regions had increased fluctuations only in the LF1 and LF2 range between 0.027 to 0.063 Hz, whereas the cortical connectivity was more widespread and was observed across the entire frequency range (0.02 to 0.1 Hz). The regions that showed significant differences across the frequency bands are depicted in Fig.  .   \nMultiband functional connectivity analysis. Rows “a to e” represent the images of the regions which showed significant differences in the DLC between baseline and sedated states. (  a  ) represents the entire frequency range {0.027to 1 Hz}, (  b  ) is LF1{0.027 to 0.045 Hz}, (  c  ) is LF2 {0.046 to 0.063 Hz} (  d  ) is LF3 {0.064 to 0.081 Hz} and (  e  ) is LF4 {0.082 to 1 Hz}. It is evident that the deep nuclear regions depicted as red is only seen in rows b and c indicating a frequency range between 0.027 to 0.063 Hz. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe evaluated DLC during a baseline awake state and a propofol-induced sedation state to investigate sedation-induced changes in brain connectivity dynamics. The findings of our study have added a new dimension to the understanding of sedation-induced altered consciousness by demonstrating decreased cortical connectivity fluctuations, fewer within region correlations, and increased deep nuclear and cerebellar connectivity fluctuations, supporting the concept of a dynamic and integrated cortico-thalamic target in consciousness . \n\nFirst, as expected, we found that several cortical regions in the DMN (PCC, pre-cuneus, angular and left middle temporal gyrus), perirolandic regions (right pre- and post-central and bilateral supplementary motor cortex), supra marginal, right middle frontal gyrus, and crus 1 and 2 of the left cerebellum had decreased cortical connectivity fluctuations during sedation. Since the average OAAS in our study was between 3 and 2, the patients were in a deeper stage of sedation and, thus, the current data are consistent with other studies that have used static connectivity measures and found decreased cortical connectivity in these regions in lower stages of consciousness . \n\nSecond, we also report increased cerebellar and deep nuclear connectivity fluctuations during sedation. An increased deep nuclear and thalamic connectivity  has been reported in previous studies that included these regions in their analysis despite the differences in analysis methods, type of drugs used and levels of sedation. Previous independent reports of the loss of within and between-network integration in frontoparietal areas  and thalamo-cortical anticorrelations  during sedation support our findings, although those studies lacked a comprehensive evaluation of deep nuclear regions and the cerebellum. The results of the current study partially addresses these areas, and we demonstrate increased correlations in the cerebellum and between the cerebellum and thalamus to the DMN in the background of disrupted cortical networks. The findings from the current study are also consistent with the theory of an integrated cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamic complex, which is well connected within itself to maintain consciousness . According to this theory, consciousness is defined as our ability to assess information wholly without breaking it into pieces, such as enjoying a musical experience without breaking it into tone, pitch, temper and amplitude, which requires the integration of several cortical and subcortical regions. \n\nThe occurrence of deep nuclear connectivity in the LF1 and LF2 (0.02 to 0.06 Hz), which are below the frequency of neocortical connectivity (0.02 to 0.10 Hz), during sedation is converse to findings in the awake state. Few studies that have considered the frequency specificity of the BOLD connectivity have reported a lower frequency range of 0.01 to 0.04 Hz in the neocortical regions and a wider frequency range in the striatum during the resting awake state . This regional frequency specificity has been ascribed to the underlying cytoarchitecture, and a wider frequency range is related to the transmodal function of the striatum, while a narrower and lower frequency range reflects the unimodal architecture of the neocortex . A functional zone classification  divides the brain into unimodal areas that are cytoarchitecturally well differentiated, receiving and sending information to primary sensory and motor areas, and transmodal areas that are less differentiated with diverse functions and connectivity. In light of these studies, the observations in the current study, together with previously observed evidence of an increased between-region integration, is probably indicative of a sedation-induced frequency shift in the transmodal function of the deep nuclear structures to a simpler unimodal function. \n\nThe increased correlation of the deep nuclear fluctuations within themselves and to the DMN likely to support a unimodal function, is consistent with the concept of quasi-independent modules of consciousness in the basal ganglia and cerebellum . It is, however, difficult to determine from the current results whether the changes found in the deep nuclear regions, including the thalamus, are the cause of the loss of consciousness or an indirect effect associated with the loss of cortical control. Because there is evidence of cortical slowing preceding the subcortical pattern in electrophysiological measures , it is likely that the deep nuclear connectivity changes occur after a certain level of loss of cortical integration. Because the role of the thalamus, cerebellum and deep nuclear structures in the loss and recovery of consciousness is well established in disorders of consciousness , it is very likely that the increased fluctuations in these deep nuclear structures are important factors, and a DLC analysis of multistage studies in awake, sedated, unconscious and recovered conditions could shed more light regarding their importance. \n\nDC has some limitations, such as a temporal resolution that is dependent on the chosen time scales and frequencies. The choice of the window width and frequency is a crucial factor that determines the results. Currently, there are no clear guidelines regarding the best choice for these variables . We measured “dynamic local connectivity” (DLC) using voxel-wise ILC because we were primarily interested in the local connectivity based on theoretical models of cortical integration and cortical edge of instability. This method is unlike global connectivity measures and it is possible that the information derived from DLC during sedation is different than dynamic global connectivity . Future studies should explore how sedation influences the interplay between DLC and dynamic global connectivity. Although we excluded frequency ranges below 0.27 Hz and above 0.10 Hz to regress the cardio-respiratory variables  the use of data driven methods, such as temporal ICA, for cardiac and respiratory time courses  would have strengthened our conclusion, particularly since spurious frequencies at approximately 0.03 Hz have been previously associated with changes in respiratory depth . It must also be noted that this study was performed with individuals with chronic low backache, which is unlike the earlier studies that involved healthy volunteers. Eight of the fourteen patients had visual analogue scale (VAS) scores ≥5 (moderate to severe pain) when they arrived at the MRI suite, necessitating the administration of fentanyl (1–1.5 µg/kg) to facilitate cooperation for the baseline awake image acquisition. This resulted in a mean VAS score of ≤4.7 ± 1.1 (mild pain) before the baseline MRI acquisition. Since it is possible that the observed alterations, particularly the deep nuclear fluctuations, could be due to pain relief during sedation, we correlated the reduction in the VAS with the mean changes in the connectivity fluctuations (Supplementary Table  ). We found no significant correlation between the pain scores and the alterations in the connectivity fluctuations. The OAAS in this study was only intermittently assessed between image acquisitions. Future studies should use simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions and plasma concentrations of propofol to continuously monitor the depth of sedation during the imaging. This information, if correlated with the dynamic connectivity changes, will likely provide a more precise understanding of the stages of anaesthesia. Despite these limitations, the findings of our study have remarkably united the two theoretical models of consciousness , supporting the possibility that consciousness is influenced by the integrated dynamics of several cortical and subcortical networks. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe current study used dynamic local connectivity resting state fMRI to demonstrate reduced cortical connectivity fluctuations and increased deep nuclear and cerebellar connectivity fluctuations during propofol-induced loss of consciousness. These findings reinforce the hypothesis that an integrated, dynamic cortical and subcortical network is a feature of consciousness. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participant Selection \n  \nFourteen subjects with chronic low backache were recruited after obtaining written informed consent. These patients were scheduled for imaging under anaesthesia because they could not lie supine in the gantry for more than 10 minutes. The experimental protocol was performed according to the required guidelines and regulations and was approved by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) Ethics Committee for conducting research on human subjects (Item No.VI, Sl.No.8.01, Clinical Neurosciences, dated 21-10-2011). \n\n\n### Pre-anaesthetic evaluation and monitoring during the procedure \n  \nIndividuals with a history of an allergy to propofol or eggs (due to the presence of egg lecithin in propofol), systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg, significant cardio-respiratory morbidity, potential airway difficulties, and ferromagnetic implants were excluded from the study. Individuals were also excluded if any structural brain pathology was detected on MRI. All individuals fasted for 8 hours before the propofol administration. Cardio-respiratory monitoring was performed throughout the procedure and included an electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure (BP), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), end-tidal carbon-dioxide (ETCO ) and respiratory rate (RR) using an MR compatible multi-parameter monitor (InVivo Corp., Orlando, FL, USA). An intravenous infusion of dextrose normal saline (5% dextrose in 0.9% NaCl) was delivered at a rate of 100 ml/h during the study period, and oxygen was provided through a facemask at 5 L/min flow. \n\n\n### Anaesthesia protocol \n  \nA dedicated intravenous access was secured for the administration of propofol (Profol , Claris Life sciences, Ahmedabad, India). Propofol was administered intravenously as a bolus dose of 1.5 mg/kg over 180 s, followed by a maintenance infusion of 1.5 mg/kg/h for the duration of the imaging using an MRI compatible syringe pump (B. Braun Space Station MRI , Melsungen, Germany). The induction and maintenance of sedation and assessment of sedation quality were performed by a single individual (SK) to reduce inter-observer variations. \n\n\n### Data Acquisition \n  \nBrain imaging was performed on a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Philips Achieva 3.0 T TX, Philips Healthcare, DA Best, Netherlands) using a 32-channel head coil. The rsfMRI data were acquired twice, once immediately before the propofol sedation (baseline) and again after achieving the desired level (OAA 3-2) of sedation with propofol (Sedation). The fMRI sequence consisted of 192 dynamics whole-brain gradient-echo echo-planar images (EPI) for a total duration of 9.5 minutes. {[TR] = 3000 ms; [TE] = 35 ms; flip angle = 78; slice thickness = 4 mm; slice order: descending; number of slices = 23; matrix = 64*64*64 mm , FOV = 230*230 mm , voxel size = 3*3*4 mm }. T1-weighted, structural imaging was performed for anatomical co-registration and segmentation. (TR:TE = 8.2:3.8, FOV = 256*256 mm , voxel size of 1*1*1 mm ). \n\n\n### Data Analysis \n  \n#### fMRI Pre-processing \n  \nThe standard functional and structural MRI pre-processing steps included the following: first six functional images were discarded to allow for signal equilibration, followed by slice-time correction, realignment, co-registration, segmentation of the anatomical data for regressing the white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) effects and normalization to MNI152 standard space of 3 × 3 × 3 mm  in SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). \n\n\n#### Head motion and artefact removal \n  \nThe head movement was obtained from the realignment steps in SPM. There was no significant difference in the head motion between the baseline awake state and the sedated state (P-value of right:forward:up:: 0.8:0.6:0.6; pitch:roll:yaw:: 0.7:0.7:0.9), and the measured maximum head motion was (right:forward:up::0.42 ± 0.36:1.01 ± 0.55:0.72 ± 0.54 (mm); pitch:roll:yaw::0.01 ± 0.01:0.006 ± 0.007:0.007 ± 0.005 (degree)) during baseline and (right:forward:up:: 0.3 ± 0.5:0.9 ± 0.4:0.8 ± 0.7 (mm); pitch:roll:yaw:: 0.014 ± 0.012:0.008 ± 0.011:0.007 ± 0.01(degree)) during sedation. Before computing the connectivity maps, the head motion and physiological source noise correction was carried out using the CompCor algorithm . The head motion correction was carried out for the transverse axis, rotation axis and the composite motion parameter, which contains the maximum window-to-window movement and its first order temporal derivatives in the first-level general linear model . For the physiological noise correction, the first five principal components of the WM and CSF time-series were considered variables of no interest. Then, the data were temporally bandpass filtered with a range of 0.027-0.1 Hz to filter the irrelevant lower frequency bands, slower than the duration of a single sliding window and higher frequency, which can include cardiac and respiratory activity . \n\n\n#### Dynamic Functional Connectivity Analysis: The sliding-window approach \n  \nA voxel-wise (Pearson’s) ILC based sliding window dynamic functional connectivity was performed using the functional connectivity toolbox (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/conn). ILC was preferred in this study because it is known to be dependent on the local connectivity with the adjacent voxels without averaging the whole brain connectivity, is less dependent on the voxel size and is less sensitive to artefacts from respiratory and cardiac cycles , which are critical measures that vary during sedation. To compute the dynamic connectivity differences in the present study, the entire time course of 186 dynamics was segmented into 12 dynamic (36 s) windows. By sliding the onset of this window by 3 dynamic (9 s) steps, we derived a total of 59 overlapping windows (sliding windows) in the first level analysis. We chose the shortest possible window length to maximally capture the dynamic changes based on the recommendations of an optimal duration between 30 and 60 seconds . The Fisher’s z-transformed ILC maps were computed for each sliding window, yielding a set of sliding-window beta maps . A second-level random-effects analysis was performed to create two within-group sample paired t-test statistical maps to identify regions with differential connectivity between the two conditions i.e., baseline and sedated state . Between-group statistical parameter maps were averaged across the sliding windows and thresholded at a whole-brain cluster-level corrected α value of 0.05 for a voxel-wise P-value of < 0.05 with a false-discovery rate (FDR) correction and a minimum cluster extent of 10 contiguous voxels. The brain regions with significant connectivity differences were visualized in multi-slice brain images using ‘xjView’ ( ) and BrainNet Viewer ( ). The strength of the connectivity dynamic was estimated by multiplying the conjugate cluster (k) with the corresponding intensity (t) values at each voxel to derive the corresponding Beta values from each sliding window z-map. The fluctuations in connectivity were measured by the mean and SD of these beta values . To ascertain significant differences in the connectivity fluctuations, paired two-sample t-tests with an α value of 0.05 were used along with corrections for multiple comparisons (p = 0.05/59 = 0.00084). The fluctuations in brain connectivity in the significant areas are shown in Figs   and  . \n\n\n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"3e4d52e5d9bba8b5ddf52b15b30197c8"},

The precise nature of abnormal brain functional connectivity (FC) dynamics including other regions, on the other hand, is unknown. The concept that insular dynamic FC (dFC) among distinct brain regions is dysregulated in children with ADHD was evaluated using Insular subregions, and we studied how these dysregulations lead to social dysfunctioning. Data from 30 children with ADHD and 28 healthy controls (HCs) were evaluated using dynamic resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). We evaluated the dFC within six subdivisions, namely both left and right dorsal anterior insula (dAI), ventral anterior insula (vAI), and posterior insula (PI). Using the insular sub-regions as seeds, we performed group comparison between the two groups. To do so, two sample   t  -tests were used, followed by   post-hoc t  -tests. Compared to the HCs, patients with ADHD exhibited decreased dFC values between right dAI and the left middle frontal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus and right of cerebellum crus, respectively. Results also showed a decreased dFC between left dAI and thalamus, left vAI and left precuneus and left PI with temporal pole. From the standpoint of the dynamic functional connectivity of insular subregions, our findings add to the growing body of evidence on brain dysfunction in ADHD. This research adds to our understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms behind social functioning deficits in ADHD. Future ADHD research could benefit from merging the dFC approach with task-related fMRI and non-invasive brain stimulation, which could aid in the diagnosis and treatment of the disorder. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed condition in children, characterized by age-inappropriate problems like inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (Thomas et al.,  ; Sayal et al.,  ). ADHD is therefore related to cognitive, academic, familial, and occupational problems (Usami,  ). Social functioning is also directly impacted by ADHD. This might be manifested as peer rejection and disagreements. Social dysfunction may negatively affect the short- and long-term prognosis of ADHD youngsters. The activities that encourage social inadequacies are directly linked to ADHD diagnosis in some infants. While children with ADHD crave social interaction, they often struggle to adapt their behavior to their environment due to the nasty, angry tone of their interactions as well as their hyperactive/impulsive behavior. This implicates rule infractions, aggressive and dominating behavior, and physical and verbal animosity. It also includes agitation and intrusion, which are often inappropriate and difficult to remedy (Lahey et al.,  ). \n\nADHD is linked to functional deficits in the cognitive, academic, familial, and occupational areas of everyday life (Usami,  ). Social functioning is another crucial aspect of ADHD that is directly affected. This might present itself as peer rejection and disputes with other children and adults. Social dysfunction may have a significant negative impact on the short- and long-term prognosis of children with ADHD. The practices that promote social deficiencies may be a direct result of diagnosing symptoms of ADHD in at least some infants. Some of ADHD's DSM-IV criteria, such as “interrupting or intruding on others,” even explicitly relate to poor social conduct (Lahey et al.,  ). Generally, the combination of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention is likely to affect social behavior. Although children with ADHD have a strong desire to interact with others, they typically struggle to adapt their attitude to their surroundings. Two behavioral characteristics are typically linked to social difficulties in children with ADHD, namely the unpleasant, hostile tone of their interactions, as well as their hyperactive/impulsive behavior. Rule violations, antagonistic and dominating behavior, and the use of physical and verbal hostility are examples of the first aspect. These actions may pose a direct threat to others, and they have been proven to be substantial predictors of negative peer nominations in both ADHD and non-ADHD children. Examples of the second aspect comprise restless and invasive conduct, which is frequently inappropriate in the current setting and difficult to remedy (Lahey et al.,  ). \n\nThe orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the amygdala, and the temporal cortex (mostly the superior temporal sulcus-STS) were found to be primary elements of the so called “social brain,” in the early 1990s (Brothers,  ). Afterwards, other areas like the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), were shown to be primary for social functioning and were therefore included with the initial core (Frith and Frith,  ; Bickart et al.,  ). Modern definitions of social brain usually incorporate dynamic and hierarchical structure of circuitry entangled in elementary constructs of more automated systems like the identification of socially significant stimuli as well as relatively overlapping circuitry implicated in higher-order operations of the psychological condition. For instance, feelings such as disgust or anger were basically associated with the aversion network where the insula is key component (Buckholtz et al.,  ). This implicates that the insula, among other brain regions in the aversion network, is mediated in aversive behaviors such as avoiding strangers that are not trustworthy. Studies have also demonstrated the implication of the insula in the \"social decision making\" that enables the selection of flexible behavioral responses to others (Rogers-Carter and Christianson,  ). More precisely, the insular cortex is anatomically located to connect integrated social sensory cues to the social decision making network, resulting in flexible and adaptive behavioral outcomes to social and emotional stimuli. In line with these findings, Belfi et al. ( ) suggested that subjects with lesion on the insula had aberrant trust expressions. During a trust game, when acting as an investor, these people behaved benevolently (showing misguided trust), and when acting as a trustee, they acted malevolently (infringing their partner's trust). Although the topic of attention, play and social behavior in children with ADHD has been studied for years now, yet, it is unfortunate that tackling the role of the insula in the social dysfunctioning in children with ADHD is still scarce. Large body of research barely mentioned the insula as part of different networks related to social functioning, especially with regard to neuroimaging-based investigations. \n\nThe majority of neuroimaging research indicates static brain networks across the course of an fMRI session. These networks show functional connections and interactions between distinct cortical and subcortical brain regions during task execution or at rest. However, because activity in static networks does not clearly display changes that occur over short periods of time during an fMRI scan, dynamic reconfiguration-based methods to discover the modular architectures of changing networks are becoming more popular and the so called dFC was introduced. By partitioning fMRI images into time windows, the interconnections between brain regions can be better understood. Dynamic reconfigurations are more sensitive and able to detect more changes in human brain activity than static reconfigurations (Patil et al.,  ). whether static or dynamic, at rest or task-based, accurately identifying the altered functional connectivity generated by ADHD or any other specific disorder is a critical endeavor that may reveal the disorder's causative factors. Both in childhood and adulthood, imaging studies have revealed structural and functional abnormalities in the brains of ADHD patients. Many evidence from fMRI studies strongly suggest that biomarkers and alterations in interactions within and between different brain connectivity may contribute to the disruption of normal brain functions and cognitive performance, leading to fluctuations in attention in patients with ADHD (Sonuga-Barke and Castellanos,  ; Shappell et al.,  ). Functional impairments in fronto-cortical and fronto-subcortical networks are basic deficiencies in both children and adults with ADHD, according to Rubia et al. ( ). Consistent with these findings, Guo et al. ( ) questioned the consistency of ADHD diagnosis from childhood to maturity, as well as the similarities and differences in abnormal functional connectivities (FCs) across ADHD children and adults. To put it another way, they looked at clinical changes and pathophysiological continuity in ADHD patients from childhood to adulthood. On the other hand, a thorough research in the literature yielded to very few researches addressing dFC in ADHD. For instance, Ahmadi et al. ( ) revealed that subtypes of ADHD have generalized anomalies in static FC and dFC between large-scale resting state networks, encompassing cortical and subcortical areas, when compared to typically developing youngsters. They came to the conclusion that dynamic changes in brain FC may better help to explain the pathophysiology of ADHD. Sun et al. ( ) suggested state-dependent dynamic changes in large-scale brain connections and network topologies in ADHD. Yang et al. ( ) found that children with ADHD have more unstable dFC of the amygdala subregions, which may impact their cognitive skills. As a result, it should be indicated that to ensure successful diagnosis, therapy, and prevention, it is critical to research the sophisticated mechanisms underlying ADHD, as well as the functional deficits of the diseased brain. rs-fMRI is one such a non-invasive and safe method of detecting spontaneous brain activity (Lu et al.,  ). Over the last three decades, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate potential imaging changes and biomarkers of ADHD. However, no significant findings were yield to study the dFC of the insula in children with ADHD, and its contribution to social dysfunction. \n\nFrom a neurobiologic standpoint, ADHD is increasingly being recognized as a disorder resulting from disruptions in large-scale brain networks. Extant studies of brain's FC in ADHD, however, have provided inconsistent outcomes, with some research suggesting hyper- and hypoconnectivity with respect to neurotypical controls and others providing null findings, mostly between the same brain networks, likely due to weak theoretical models, inadequate quantitative approaches, and variation in protocols and measures across data collection silos. Importantly, little is understood about the dynamics of brain connectivity in ADHD, because earlier research assumed that functional linkages across brain regions or networks were stationary. Aiming to overcome these challenges, this study investigated Insular subregions to test the hypothesis that insular dFC among different brain regions is impaired in children with ADHD, and these impairments may play a role in social dysfunction. Furthermore, the neural biomarkers found in children with ADHD were analyzed to see if they might be used as group-level features to distinguish patients with ADHD from HCs. The findings of this study could provide new imaging-based insights that can assist explain the clinical manifestations of ADHD and improve our understanding of the brain mechanism behind its symptoms in the pathway to ADHD. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants and Measures \n  \nShenzhen Children's Hospital provided data with a total of 30 ADHD boys aged between 7 and 10 years and 28 HCs having the same age range. Two experienced psychiatrists assessed all of the patients to ensure that they met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD based on clinical interviews that followed the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. The participants and their parents were interviewed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version interview (K-SADS-PL; Kaufman et al.,  ). ADHD diagnoses were based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders-fourth edition (DSM IV) (Association,  ). Clinically-referred children who satisfied the DSM-IV criteria (either mixed, mainly inattentive, or predominantly hyperactive/impulsive subtype) were included in this study. \n\nFor each ADHD patient, parents, teachers, and other people who are in charge of caring for the kid were asked about the child's behaviors and conducts in various settings, such as at home, school, or with peers. The Conners-3 parent/teacher ratings (Conners,  ) was used to evaluate ADHD symptoms and associated issues such as disruptive behavior and learning difficulties. The used lengthy Conner-3 version has 105/111 items (parent/teacher) that are graded on a 4-point Likert-scale from 0 (never) to 3 (very much/very frequently). The Conners-3 comprises scales such as hyperactivity/impulsivity, inattention, learning problems, executive functions, aggression, peer relations (content scales); DSM IV-inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, DSM IV-conduct disorder, DSM IV-oppositional defiant disorder (symptom scales); ADHD index, Global index. We obtained an internal consistency Cronbach's α (Christiansen et al.,  ) of 0.84 for the content scales and α = 0.80 for the symptom scales of the Conners-3 parent rating scale. Children with ADHD who showed persistent patterns of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that affect their functioning and development for at least 6 months were diagnosed. Accordingly, healthcare providers examined symptoms of inattention such as: (1) failing to pay close attention to details or making thoughtless blunders, in schoolwork, (2) frequently struggling to maintain focus on chores or recreational activities, (3) frequently ignoring instructions and directions and failing to complete homework or chores (e.g., loses focus, side-tracked), (4) having a hard time keeping track of tasks and activities, (5) during regular activities, the kid is prone to forgetfulness and distraction, (6) frequently misplaces items required for chores and activities (e.g., school materials, pencils, books, tools, eyeglasses), (7) frequently avoids, hates, or is hesitant to accomplish tasks that demand sustained mental effort (such as schoolwork or homework). Symptoms related to hyperactivity and impulsivity were also examined such as: (1) being unable to play or participate in leisure activities in a peaceful manner, (2) talking excessively, (3) having difficulty waiting for their turn, (3) disturbs or invades the privacy of others (e.g., butts into conversations or games). The cognitive function was assessed using the Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) (Lee and Chan,  ) which indeed has effect on the working memory that can, in turn, have behavioral consequences similar to those of externally perceived stimuli. As for the assessment of social functioning, there were specific questions about the number of close friends, the contact with them. Ratings were made on a 4-point scale (less than one, 1–2, 3–4, 5 or more). The quality of ADHD children's relationships with friends and their reactions to family members visits was also evaluated using a questionnaire of a 5-point scale [from 0 (no contact/reaction at all) to 5 (very well)]. \n\nThe K-SADS-PL was used to consult the children in HCs group, as well as their parents, to check that they did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for ADHD or any other mental illnesses. Normal eyesight and hearing were also required, as well as a Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) ≥70 calculated using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition. Participants with current or previous psychological illnesses, major physical disorders, neurological disorders, or brain injuries were not allowed to participate in this study. The Shenzhen Children's Hospital Medical Research Ethics Committee gave their approval to this study. All of the children agreed to take part in this study, and their parents gave signed informed consent. \n\n\n### 2.2. rs-fMRI Data Acquisition \n  \nThe rs-fMRI data for all participants were obtained using a 3.0-T system scanner (Siemens Magnetom Skyra) at the Radiology Department of Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China. The rs-fMRI data were acquired using echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2, 000  ms  ; echo time = 30  ms  ; flip angle = 90°; matrix size = 64 × 64; 32 axial slices; field of view = 24 × 24  cm  ; slice thickness = 3  mm   and no gap. Structure 3D-MPRAGE; T1 Repetition Time [TR, ms] = 2,300 ms, Echo Time [TE, ms] = 2.26; Number of Averages = 1.0, Slice Thickness = 1.0  mm  , Field of View (FOV) = 256  mm  . \n\n\n### 2.3. Data Pre-processing \n  \nThe DPABI toolkit (Yan et al.,  ) was used to preprocess the data. Because of the volatility of the initial magnetic resonance imaging signal and the participants' adaption to the experimental setup, the first 10 volumes were eliminated. The remaining 220 volumes were first realigned to correct for head-motion before being corrected by the acquisition time delay among different slices. Under the head motion criterion of ±3  mm   and no participant was excluded. The pictures were then normalized and resampled into a voxel size of 3 × 3 × 3  mm   utilizing an uniform segmentation of anatomical images. The following three steps were engaged in normalization: 1) Each participant's T1 structural images were co-registered to their corresponding functional images; 2) Co-registered T1 images were segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid using transformation parameters that indicated transformation from subject native space to standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space; 3) Functional images were finally transformed into the standard space using transformation p. Additional regression was applied to nuisance factors, such as 24 head movement parameters, global signal, white matter signal, and cerebrospinal fluid signal, to adjust for physiological noise, such as motion and cardiac and respiratory cycles. Following that, the data were linearly detrended, filtered at 0.01–0.08 Hz, and smoothed with a 6  mm   full-width-at-half-maximum Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n### 2.4. Head Motion \n  \nThe mean framewise displacement (FD) created during the scanning process was removed using Jenkinson's relative root-mean-square technique (Jenkinson et al.,  ). To evaluate the voxel-wise motion differences between the two groups, the mean FD (Jenkinson) was determined. The mean FD did not change substantially between the ADHD and HC groups (  p   < 0.6). \n\n\n### 2.5. Static Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nSeed areas were chosen based on the presence of social dysfunctioning-related anomalies in right and letf dAI, vAI, and PI in FC. The seeds were obtained using cluster analysis, in agreement with earlier literature (Deen et al.,  ), in which the insula was subdivided based on FC pattern clustering. We were primarily interested in the rdAI and rvAI regions, which have been linked to attention and emotion, as well as an outwardly and inwardly oriented system, respectively (Touroutoglou et al.,  ). The right and left hemispheres of the dAI, vAI, and PI were then transformed to MNI 152 standard brain (3-mm resolution) and used as seed regions in the FC analysis in HC and ADHD patients. We used the REST toolbox (  to perform seed-based FC studies to evaluate the aberrant sFC of seed regions in HC and ADHD. Between the mean time course of each seed region and the time course of all other voxels in the entire brain, Pearson's correlation coefficient was derived. To increase the Gaussianity of their distribution, the resulting r maps were turned into z maps using Fisher's r-to-z transformation. We obtained z-score maps for each subject that represented the sFC of the right and left of dAI, vAI, and PI. \n\n\n### 2.6. Dynamic Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nUsing the DynamicBC toolbox (Liao et al.,  ), the sliding window method was used to analyze the dFC for each participant. According to previous research, the window length is an open but important parameter in sliding window based resting state dynamic computation (Fateh et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Yang et al.,  ). This approach can calculate the time-varying covariance of interregional neural signals, which is the variance of dFC, and reveal the temporal aspects of FC during the full scan period. The sliding window method uses the window length as a crucial parameter.The minimum window length should not be smaller than 1/fmin, as per Leonardi and van de Ville (Leonardi and Van De Ville,  ), because a very short window length may generate spurious fluctuations. In addition, the fmin represents the time courses' minimal frequency. The dynamic properties of the time series would be made unobservable if the window length was too long. We chose a window length of 50 TRs (i.e., 100s) and a step size of 1 TR because a window length of 50 TR was proposed to maximize the balance between recording a fast altering dynamic relationship and producing credible estimations of the correlations between regions (Liao et al.,  ) (i.e., 2s). In the validation analyses that followed, other window lengths and step sizes were also evaluated. Liao et al. ( ) computed the Fisher's z-transformed Pearson's correlation coefficient between the average time series of each seed region and the remaining voxels in the whole brain in each window. As a result, each participant received a set of sliding-window correlation maps. Calculating standard deviation values at each voxel across sliding-windows was used to estimate the dFC. \n\n\n### 2.7. Statistical Analyses \n  \nTo see if there was a difference in the dFC of the insular subregion between HCs and ADHD patients, a two-sample   t  -test model was used. Confounding factors such as the mean FD, age, gender, and grade were regressed out. T-statistic images were transformed to z-statistic images, and then thresholder using clusters identified by a z value of >2.3 and a cluster-level thresholder   p  -value of 0.05, corrected for whole-brain multiple comparison correction using Gaussian random field theory. The regions of interest (ROIs) for the   post-hoc   analysis were chosen from the survivors' brain clusters. The data were corrected by multiple comparisons using Gaussian random field theory (GRF, voxel-wise   p   < 0.001, cluster-wise   p   < 0.05, two-tailed) and the dynamic R-fMRI indices and voxel-wise concordance were compared using a two-sample   t  -test. On these ROIs, a two-tailed, two-sample   t  -test was used to evaluate the differences between two groups (HC vs. ADHD). The statistical significance level is   p   < 0.05/6. (Bonferroni correction).

Validation Analysis \n  \nWe performed validation analysis for several sliding window lengths besides 50 TR to corroborate our findings of dFC variability derived from 50 TR lengths of the sliding window. As a consequence, we recalculated the primary dFC results with the other two window lengths (30TR and 80TR). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Demographic and Clinical Information \n  \nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the ADHD and HC groups were listed in  . No differences in sex and mean FD were detected between the two groups. We found a large differences in IQ, working memory and learning problems between the two groups, in a way that these variables were lower in ADHD patients compared to HCs. For social functioning, children with ADHD had a significantly lower number of social contacts, and a poorer quality of social contacts with family members compared to the HCs group. It was also shown that ADHD patients had more problems with social relations with their peers although the effects were marginally significant (i.e.,   p   < 0.1). \n  \nDemographic and clinical information. \n  \n HC, healthy control; ADHD, Attention deficit hyperactivity; FD, frame-wise displacement; SD, Standard deviation; a, Two-samplet-test; IS, interference score  . \n  \n\n### 3.2.

We recalculated the main results by using two other window lengths (30 TR and 80 TRs) were similar to the main results of 50 TR in our study.The corresponding results are shown in the  . All validation analysis results are presented in  – . \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nImpaired attention, impulsivity and hyperactivity are the solely hallmarks in ADHD. These symptoms are directly related to social dysfunctioning that mostly affects the daily life of ADHD patients, especially kids. Despite its importance to the neuroimaging research community, few studies about dFC in children and adolescents with ADHD have been published so far. Although there are no clinically accurate biomarkers for the diagnosis of ADHD, this study investigated the insula dFC with other brain regions in the hope that such research can promote to the discovery of numerous viable candidate biomarkers, especially those associated to social dysfunctioning. Our findings support the hypothesis that the insular dFC with distinct brain regions is altered, and these deficits may be implicated in social dysfunction. Consistent with our hypothesis, compared to HCs, patients with ADHD showed decreased dFC values between right dAI and the left frontal_mid gyrus, left postcentral gyrus and the right of cerebellum crus. Results also indicated a decreased dFC between left dAI and thalamus, left vAI and left precuneus and left PI with temporal pole mid. \n\nSocial dysfunctioning is a broad term that is manifested by various neuropsychiatric disorders. To date, the majority of studies investigating social functioning have relied on self-report, questionnaire-based measures of social function (Hodgetts et al.,  ). In this study, with regard to ADHD, during diagnosis testing, we opted for a number of aspects (i.e., cognitive and executive functioning, working memory, learning problems, and anxiety-related symptoms and other measures; namely the number of social contacts, the quality of social contacts for both family and friends and the problems with social relations with their peers) depending on the available participants' data. These aspects entail other related concepts such as emotion regulation and attention orientation. The current findings, as well as those from earlier studies (Biederman et al.,  ), suggest that children with ADHD frequently experience issues with social relationships. Due to their behavioral problems (e.g., not following the rules when playing a game), these children may not have the same opportunities to make friends. Other impaired functional connectivity that are possibly associated with social dysfunctioning are discussed below considering our dFC's findings. We also found a considerable differences in IQ, working memory and learning problems between the two groups. Many studies have demonstrated that both IQ and working memory are related to learning in a sense that these IQ and working memory would predict reading, writing, and math skills in children (Alloway and Copello,  ). Our findings are consistent with other existing studies in the literature (Rohrer-Baumgartner et al.,  ) that found in children with below median IQ-score, a larger number of ADHD symptoms were more likely to be accompanied by reports of lower expressive language skills. One possible reason for such lower scores and their implications to the lower expressive language skills is due to impaired (decreased) dFC between the Insula and the frontal middle gyrus since these two regions have been involved in language, self expression and learning. More related interpretations are presented below. \n\nThe insula (or insular cortex) is a thin ribbon of gray matter tissue that lies just deep to the lateral brain surface, separating the temporal lobe from the inferior parietal cortex (Broder and Preston,  ). Taste, visceral sensation, and autonomic control are only a few of the homeostatic activities pertaining to basic survival needs that involve the insula. It was also proved that the insula regulates the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, which control autonomic activities (Bud Craig,  ). According to functional connectivity studies and in line with our study, the human insula has at least three different segments (Nomi et al.,  ). A dorsal anterior insula (dAI) subdivision with connections to the frontal, anterior cingulate, and parietal areas is participated in cognitive control processes; a ventral anterior insula (vAI) subdivision has connections to limbic areas and is involved in affective processes; and a mid-posterior insula (PI) subdivision has connections to brain regions for sensorimotor processing (Cereda et al.,  ). Based on our dFC analysis, while studying time-varying patterns of interactions between insular subdivisions and other brain regions, we found that the dAI has more changeable connections than the other insular segments. This is consistent with previous research indicating the dAI's functional \"diversity,\" which is engaged across numerous task domains (Penfield and Faulk,  ; Cereda et al.,  ). On the other hand, recent functional imaging investigations have found that the left or right lateralization of emotional processing is influenced by stimulus valence (positive or negative emotions) (Harrington,  ), behavior (approach/withdrawal) (Davidson et al.,  ), and subjective state (perception/experience) (Peelen et al.,  ). In regard to the lateralization of the human insula, our findings revealed the following insights: (1) stronger dFC of the insula in the left hemisphere than the right, which was manifested among all subdivisions (2) heterogeneous connectivity between insula subdivisions' profiles. In accordance with these findings, a number of lesion case studies elucidated the role of left insula in executive set-switching (executive functioning) which is mainly associated with ADHD. For instance, Varjačić et al. ( ) suggested support for the role of the left insular cortex in flexible attention switching among stroke survivors. Markostamou et al. ( ) studied the case of a woman with an acute left anterior insular infarction that led to executive (word and design fluency, mental flexibility, sustained attention, inhibitory control) but not language, visuoperceptual, or memory deficits. Conflicting with these findings, by considering the the way we relate language to our interpersonal relationships, while some functional imaging studies reported greater activation in the left insula in equal bilingual young adults (Chee et al.,  ), others demonstrated the brain's ability to sustain proper language without the insula (Duffau et al.,  ). On the other hand, regarding our second finding which supports many relevant recent researches proposing a tripartite organization rather than the traditional anterior-posterior dichotomy. Nomi et al. ( ) elucidated that the functional profiles of the insular subdivisions are both unique and overlapping. \n\nOur decreased dFC results were compatible with other studies (Wang et al.,  ) that found significant decreases in both functional connectivity and global network efficiency. This decrease may correspond to either patients' insula incapability to integrate external sensory information with cognitive abilities including supervisory attentional control (Cieslik et al.,  ) and interior emotion or to the small size of the data sample. The former inference is due to the anatomy of the nervous system whereby the thalamus takes information from “homeostatic afferent” sensory pathways and transfers it to the insula, which then sends it to a number of limbic-related regions, including the amygdala. \n\nAnother key result of this study is the alteration of dFC between left AI and left thalamus. Consistent with our findings, in regard with social dysfunctioning, the processing of information relevant to gustatory, visceral, and autonomic functions, and even salient information and emotion regulation, is underpinned by connections between the thalamus and the anterior insula (Ghaziri et al.,  ). A decreased FC with limbic regions such as the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and insula in people with subclinical anxiety were reported in Scheinost et al. ( ) and in ADHD adolescents (Rubia et al.,  ). Mills et al. ( ), in turn, also suggested a corticostriatal-thalamic connectivity changes in children with ADHD and they then discussed the relation of these results to patients' working memory ability. Working memory is critical for reasoning, decision-making, and behavior guidance and it is among the core difficulties especially for students with ADHD. We continually handle social cognitive information, whether it's keeping track of friends' viewpoints during conversation, a roomful of colleagues' beliefs during a conference, or the political ideology of someone we just met. Smooth social interaction necessitates keeping track of a variety of social data, such as individual attributes and interpersonal relationships and this referred to social working memory where both the thalamus and the insula are involved (Meyer and Lieberman,  ). This illustrates our result in a sense that deficits in working memory in children, especially during learning-based activities, can result in children experiencing information overload and thus they may act out behaviorally or withdraw socially. In other words, this disrupted dFC between left AI and left thalamus, a finding that can be interpreted as support for the significant differences we found in IQ, working memory and behavioral problems between the two groups. \n\nImportantly, we found a disrupted dFC between the right dAI and frontal middle gyrus. The implication of the frontal middle gyrus in competencies such as literacy, numeracy has been widely discussed by neuroimaging studies (Koyama et al.,  ). However, in line with our findings, Japee et al. ( ) suggested the role of middle frontal gyrus in the reorienting of attention which indicates the individuals' ability to efficiently pick and guide their attention toward behaviorally relevant information in their environment. Postcentral gyrus, on the other hand, was also involved in our study whereby dFC analysis showed alterations between this region and the right dAI. Intriguingly, Du et al. ( ) found a stronger within-network connectivity in the insula, the thalamus and the postcentral gyrus among other brain regions that constitute the so called punishment network. From a social psychological standpoint, this study strongly supports our results in such a way that people are compelled to comply out of fear of punishment since a minority position is aversive and it can result in hostility, condemnation, rejection from others, or social isolation. People may be encouraged to adhere to the majority position in order to escape such social penalty. Along with our results, the finding that the postcentral gyrus is amongst the potentially relevant brain areas in punishment processing, represents what could be a previously unknown function for this part of the brain and could provide a new target for researchers. \n\nOur findings also showed altered dFC between left PI and right temporal pole. Generally, temporal areas comprising the temporal sulcus were found to be involved in the so called social attention and face perception particularly (Nummenmaa and Calder,  ). Social attention refers to the social conduct that underpins joint attention, with the goal of coordinating attention allocation with others. These crucial social abilities are thought to be dependent on the development of attention skills such as (1) detecting eye-direction and (2) allocating attention to the same focus of attention as another human being. These cortical areas are critical in the processing of socially relevant cues such gaze following, eye direction, and head orientation (Hopkins et al.,  ). Conflicting with these findings, other literature interestingly suggested that temporal pole activations are more common in sophisticated emotional tasks like theory of mind activities, but are less common in simpler emotional tasks like emotional face perception or gaze perception tasks (Olson et al.,  ). \n\nTo sum up, by interpreting our results, we displayed the insula's ability to be both specialized and integrative and to operate both independently and cooperatively. This could explain how the insula functions as a network hub, coordinating input from various cognitive areas and activities. More replicated research on this area is required in the future especially for more specified aspects associated to social dysfunction such as social inattention. \n\n### 4.1. Limitations \n  \nPower considerations may limit our ability to examine the consequences of medications and comorbidity with other diseases, particularly those with inattention impairments like autism, substance dependence, depression, anxiety or learning disorders. Furthermore, the consequences of head motion are in general a constant source of concern in in ADHD and imaging youth. To deal with the issue of motion, we omitted high-motion subjects as an exclusion criteria, and we suggest considering other methods such as regressing realignment parameters and performing individual-level separation techniques such as independent component analysis. Moreover, this research used cross-sectional data and merely served as a surrogate for maturational effects. Extending and refining dynamic connectivity techniques in ADHD will be possible in the future with larger and longitudinal subject populations. \n\nFurthermore, in task-based fMRI trials, nothing is known about how dynamic functional connections are associated to social dysfunctioning. Although prior research has shown that the insula's static functional connections are altered within the salience and default mode networks (Zhao et al.,  ), there have been few studies that have looked at dynamic functional connections underlying social dysfunctioning during task states (Fong et al.,  ). Future research should look into how dynamic connections between insula subdivisions function in task-based fMRI studies. \n\nAlso, in our current configuration, functional connectivity evaluations were conducted using standardized insular sub-region seeds. Individual differences in the size and placement of functional areas may have an impact on connectivity maps. Individualized seeds created from a functional parcellation approach will aid future investigations in overcoming these methodological flaws. \n\nFinally, It should be noted that the current dFC method is just one of several approaches for mapping the dynamic functional connections between distinct brain areas. Graph theoretical approaches (Braun et al.,  ), test statistics tracking time course variations (Zalesky et al.,  ), co-activation pattern identification (Chen et al.,  ), and employing time frequency information (Yang et al.,  ) have all held promise in identifying changes in functional connections that static FC methods fail to capture. Future research should look into how these different measurements can help to better understand the dynamic functional links of the insula subdivisions. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nClinicians can diagnose psychopathology associated to insular dysfunction and stratify differential remedies by translating basic science into clinically useful facts. To improve our treatments, we must connect the pieces of evidence to fully comprehend any brain region, learn how the brain works, and decode clinical manifestations. The regulation of instrumental parts of the brain, such as the insula, is at the heart of daily life's micro-operations. This study provides evidence that the ability of the insula to serve as a subjective experiencing and feeling center that combines emotional, sensory, cognitive, and motor functions is its primary purpose. Therefore, we suggest that the insula is implicated in social dysfunctioning in childern with ADHD, and hence, aberrant insular dFC and provides an essential connectivity marker associated with a diagnosis of ADHD. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets presented in this article are not readily available due to privacy concerns, and access to the data used in this study is restricted.

Memory processing ability highly depends on the dynamic coordination between distinct modules within the hippocampal network. Here, we investigate the relationship between memory phenotypes and modular alterations of dynamic functional connectivity (FC) in the hippocampal network in TLE patients. Then, 31 healthy controls and 66 TLE patients with hippocampal sclerosis were recruited. The patients were classified into memory‐intact (MI, 35 cases) group and memory‐deficit (MD, 31 cases) group, each based on individual's Wechsler Memory Scale‐Revised score. The sliding‐windows approach and graph theory analysis were used to analyze the hippocampal network based on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Temporal properties and modular metrics were calculated. Two discrete and switchable states were revealed: a high modularized state (State I) and a low modularized state (State II), which corresponded to either anterior or posterior hippocampal network dominated pattern. TLE was prone to drive less State I but more State II, and the tendency was more obvious in TLE‐MD. Additionally, TLE‐MD showed more widespread alterations of modular properties compared with TLE‐MI across two states. Furthermore, the dynamic modularity features had unique superiority in discriminating TLE‐MD from TLE‐MI. These findings demonstrated that state transitions and modular function of dissociable hippocampal networks were altered in TLE and more importantly, they could reflect different memory phenotypes. The trend revealed potential values of dynamic FC in elucidating the mechanism underlying memory impairments in TLE. \n  \nThe present research provides evidence that the modular organization of the hippocampal network fluctuates over time, presenting either anterior or posterior hippocampal network dominated states. We highlight that functional differences between Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with and without memory impairment can be observed in modular alternations of the hippocampal network, which indicated that the dynamic functional alternations of the hippocampal network are more sensitive in reflecting memory impairment in TLE. Our findings introduced a new perspective of understanding the dynamic functional connectivity of memory network in different memory status in TLE, which could potentially facilitate the diagnosis and treatment strategies.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nMemory disorder is a common cognitive comorbidity of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Around 50% of the TLE patients suffer greatly from severe memory deficits, the rests remains relatively intact (Helmstaedter & Elger,  ; Thompson & Corcoran,  ). In the 1960s, the researchers considered that memory impairment may be related to the damaged integrity of the hippocampus in TLE (Milner,  ). Since the early 1990s, there has been a shift toward the thinking that the degree of memory impairment is closely associated with the extent of abnormalities in the hippocampal memory circuits (Bell, Lin, Seidenberg, & Hermann,  ; Saling,  ; Squire & Zola‐Morgan,  ). Importantly, the heterogeneity of memory performance with TLE may indicate different cognitive phenotypes relate to the whole brain network changes (Dabbs, Jones, Seidenberg, & Hermann,  ; Kaestner et al.,  ; Rayner, Tailby, Jackson, & Wilson,  ; Reyes et al.,  ). Cognitive phenotypes have the potential to provide marks for treatment and prognosis. However, it is not well known that whether the “memory‐deficits” (MD) and “memory‐intact” (MI) phenotypes within TLE have unique patterns of the hippocampal “network” characteristics. Thus, further elucidating the hippocampal network underlying the memory phenotypes may provide individualized strategy for TLE management. \n\nThe hippocampal network consists of regions in medial temporal lobe (MTL) and extra‐MTL, some of which are believed to be involved in memory processes in TLE. Previous studies using task based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques in TLE demonstrated that the aberrant functional coupling and activation in the MTL, including the hippocampus, perirhinal cortex (PRC), and parahippocampal cortex (PHC), were closely related to the episodic memory declines (Doucet, Osipowicz, Sharan, Sperling, & Tracy,  ; Figueiredo et al.,  ; Powell et al.,  ; Vannest, Szaflarski, Privitera, Schefft, & Holland,  ). Moreover, anterior extra‐MTL including regions like orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala (AMY), and anterior fusiform gyrus (FUS) and posterior extra‐MTL including regions like posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), precuneus (PREC) anterior inferior temporal cortex (ITC), and angular gyrus (ANG) were reported to be abnormal activation in TLE across different memory process (Addis, Moscovitch, & McAndrews,  ; Bonelli et al.,  ; Guedj et al.,  ; Hill, King, Lega, & Rugg,  ; Sidhu et al.,  ). Further studies of large‐scale network analysis focusing on the hippocampal network indicated widespread abnormalities of functional connectivity (FC) as well as nodal topological properties, which contribute greatly to identifying memory abilities in TLE (Bettus et al.,  ; McCormick et al.,  ; Roger, Pichat, Torlay, & David,  ). However, most of previous studies did not consider the important aspect of the functional diversity in this network, as the hippocampus was assessed as a unitary structure. \n\nRecent evidence considered that there are dissociable hippocampal networks along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus (Poppenk & Moscovitch,  ; Ranganath & Ritchey,  ; Voets et al.,  ). More specifically, the modularity feature was found in the hippocampal network, suggesting that anterior MTL (e.g., anterior hippocampus and PRC) and posterior MTL (e.g., posterior hippocampus and PHC) are connected with extra‐MTL modules through different neuroanatomical pathways. The anterior and posterior MTL implicated in sematic knowledge presentation and scenes/spatial layouts respectively, and their interplay with extra‐MTL modules serves as integration for memory system (Ritchey, Libby, & Ranganath,  ). Our previous study demonstrated that alteration in this conceptual framework contributes to revealing the changes of diverse memory systems in TLE (Li et al.,  ). \n\nThe brain network can be characterized by the principles of graph theory analysis, in particular the characteristic of modularity. Typically, modularity can be described as the brain network with a given module partition, presenting spatially separated modules with densely intramodular connections and sparsely intermodular connections (Sporns & Betzel,  ). In addition, the interactions between specialized brain modules with fluctuating over time were observed by dynamic FC analysis, presenting reoccurring patterns of brain states (Allen et al.,  ; Bosman, Lansink, & Pennartz,  ; Chang & Glover,  ; Gonzalez‐Castillo et al.,  ). Modular segregation and integration are two basic brain patterns (Friston,  ), which were reported within the hippocampal network dominating in episodic memory encoding and retrieval, respectively (Cooper & Ritchey,  ). Investigating modularity features of the hippocampal network and their dynamic fluctuations may provide important evidence for understanding the mechanism of memory impairment in TLE. \n\nHerein, we hypothesized that TLE patients with different memory phenotypes may have distinct functional modular patterns of the hippocampal network during resting. In this study, we used resting‐state fMRI and a combination method of graph theory analysis and sliding‐window approaches to test this hypothesis. Our aim involves two aspects: (a) whether the hippocampal network has integrated and segregated states during resting and (b) whether the temporal properties of the dynamic hippocampal network can predict memory phenotypes in TLE. \n\n\n## MATERIAL AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. (Study No. 2014‐151), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Then, 79 right‐handed subjects, including 66 TLE patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS) (left, 35; right, 31) and 31 healthy controls (HC), were consecutively enrolled from April 2014 to January 2020. All patients were referred from the comprehensive epilepsy center in our hospital. Each patient was diagnosed based on the detailed history, neurological examination, video‐EEG recordings, and MRI findings. The inclusion criteria included: (a) unilateral HS without other abnormalities on MRI such as cerebral trauma, tumors, vascular malformations, or malformations of cortical development and (b) electroclinical features suggesting ipsilateral TLE. Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: (a) a history of brain trauma or surgery, (b) evidence of an infectious origin, (c) a severe psychiatric disorder, or (d) bilateral TLE. Clinical and imaging data including detailed medical history, scalp video electroencephalogram, routine epileptic MRI, high resolution hippocampal T2WI images, and neuropsychological examination were obtained. HC without neurological or psychiatric disorders were recruited. \n\n\n### Neuropsychological measurements \n  \nImmediate retrieval tests were performed by the Wechsler Memory Scale‐Revised, Chinese version. The scores of the verbal paired associates and logical memory tests were added together as verbal memory scores, as well as the scores of the figure memory, recognition and visual reproduction tests were added together as nonverbal memory scores. The total scores of verbal and nonverbal memory were converted into z‐scores separately. Impairment was defined as memory z‐scores at least 1.5   SD  s below the mean HC data. Taking into account the limited sample size, two groups of memory phenotypes would be appropriate for statistical analysis in this present study. In our study, all patients completed each memory subtest. Patients were determined to be impaired in the memory domain if verbal memory or nonverbal memory z‐scores fell within the impaired range. Then, 66 patients were classified into 2 groups, within which 35 as MI and 31 as MD (verbal memory impairment: 17, nonverbal memory impairment: 3, both verbal and nonverbal memory impairment: 11). \n\n\n###  MRI   acquisition \n  \nStructural MRI and resting state fMRI data were acquired using a 3 T Discovery MR750 (GE Healthcare) scanner with an eight‐channel head coil in the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. All patients were scanned during the interictal period (at least 3 days after the latest focal seizure and at least 7 days after the latest focal to bilateral generalized tonic–clonic seizure). All subjects were asked to keep their eyes closed, let their mind relaxed during scans. T1 weight structural data were acquired using a high‐resolution three‐dimensional brain volume (3D‐BRAVO) imaging sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)/echo time = 8.2/3.2 ms, inversion time = 450 ms, flip angle = 12°, matrix = 256 × 256, voxel size = 0.47 × 0.47 × 1 mm  without slice gap, and 206 slices. Resting‐state data were obtained using a gradient‐echo echo‐planar imaging sequence (TR/echo time = 2000/30 ms, flip angle = 77°, matrix = 64 × 64, voxel size = 3.75 × 3.75 × 4 mm  with no gap, number of slices = 38), for a total of 180 TRs (6 min) or 195 TRs (6.5 min) per scan. \n\n\n### Analysis \n  \n#### Functional image preprocessing \n  \nResting‐state fMRI data were preprocessed using SPM 12 ( ) and DPABI software ( ). To maintain data consistency, we selected the first 180 brain volumes of each subject for the following analysis. The first 10 scans were removed to stabilize the MRI baseline signal. The following steps include slice‐time correction, realignment, spatial normalization with resampling to 3‐mm isotropic voxels through T1 weight structural images, linear detrending, regression of nuisance covariates (Friston‐24 head motion parameters, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid signals), and temporal filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz). Smoothing was unapplied for avoiding extraction of averaged component with mixed signals that belong to outside ROIs. \n\n\n\n### Network construction \n  \nROIs of MTL and extra‐MTL were defined to construct a hippocampal network. These ROIs comprise the MTL (anterior nodes: anterior hippocampus and PRC); posterior nodes: posterior hippocampus and PHC) and the extra‐MTL (anterior nodes: AMYG, anterior FUS, anterior ITC, OFC; posterior nodes: RSC, PCC, PREC, and ANG). The anterior and posterior hippocampus masks were created using voxel‐wise correlation analysis. Details of the parcellation of the hippocampus steps are described in our previous study (Xu, Guan, Li, Xu, & Zhang,  ). The PHC and PRC masks were extracted from an MTL atlas ( ). The other ROIs were obtained from the Harvard‐Oxford Structural Atlas ( ). In total, 24 target masks were assigned to ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere (12 for each hemisphere) subsequently used for the analyses. By generating pairwise Pearson coefficients between each pair of mean ROI time series and proceeding to use Fisher z‐transformation (Fz) to stabilize the distribution of Pearson's correlation, we obtained a hippocampal netwo  r  k 24 × 24 Fz weighted matrix for each subject. We flipped the corresponding regions of the right hemisphere to the left hemisphere in right TLE‐HS patients and proportionate HC for the following analysis. \n\n\n### Dynamic functional analysis \n  \nDynamic functional analysis was performed using DynamicBC toolbox ( ) with the sliding‐window approach and k‐mean clustering method (see Supporting Information Figure   in Appendix S1). First, to capture the hippocampal network time‐varying correlations, we segmented the whole time series into a fixed window with a width of 20 TRs. This setting has demonstrated good balance between the estimation of dynamic connectivity and statistical tests, owing to no suppression of blood oxygenation level‐dependent frequency beyond 0.01 Hz (Zalesky & Breakspear,  ). With a step‐wise slide of 1 TR along the 170‐TR length scan, we constructed 150 successive 24 × 24 matrices for each subject. The resulting correlation matrices were converted to z‐values with Fz. \n\nSecond, we used the K‐means clustering algorithm to cluster dynamic FC patterns across control and patients together (Lloyd,  ). This clustering algorithm was repeated 100 times to weaken the impact of local minima (Pascual‐Marqui, Michel, & Lehmann,  ). The correlation distance function was used to measure similarity between FC matrices of different windows since the correlation distance metric is more sensitive to the FC pattern irrespective of magnitude (Damaraju et al.,  ). A K of 2 were obtained using three recognized evaluation indexes (Silhouette, Calinski‐Harabasz, and Davies‐Bouldin) in a search range of K from 2 to 10 (see Supporting Information Figure S2 in Appendix S1). Afterward, the resulting optimal clusters were indicated as two corresponding cluster centroids, which were regarded as two dynamic FC states across subjects and windows. Using these subjects state vectors (a vector indicating which state each time point is assigned to), we assess the temporal variability of dynamic FC: (a) fractional windows, means the occupancy of each state, which is calculated as a ratio between the number of windows assigned to each state and the number of total time windows; (b) mean dwell time, denotes the window length of the subject staying in certain state, which is calculated as an average of the consecutive number of windows assigned to certain state before changing to the other state; and (c) number of transitions, calculated as the number of windows switching from one state to the other state. \n\n\n### Static and dynamic modular analysis \n  \nA predefined module parcellation was applied for the modular analysis of the hippocampal functional networks, including anterior MTL module, posterior MTL module, anterior extra‐MTL module and posterior extra‐MTL module (see Supporting Information   for more detail). This predefined module partition provides an unbiased sample‐independent reference for group statistical comparisons and keep a consistent framework for the subsequent modular interaction analysis across static and dynamic states. \n\nWe investigated the static modular properties of this hippocampal network in each participant: (a) global modularity value, reflecting the degree to which a set of nodes are operating as distinct networks based on their covariation in activity (see Supporting Information “Global modularity analysis” section in Appendix S1 for more detail) and (b) intramodular and intermodular connectivity, calculated as the mean node‐to‐node connectivity of all nodes within a module and the mean node‐to‐node connectivity for each pair of nodes between distinct modules. \n\nFor dynamic functional modular analysis, 151 time‐varying functional correlation matrices for each subject were transformed into the corresponding Fz weight matrices. Only positive correlations of each windowed correlation matrix were selected to generate dynamic weighted functional networks for each subject. Then, a predefined module partition was applied for calculating intrasubject modular properties of dynamic weighed functional networks. Each window of intrasubject dynamic modular properties was labeled by individual's state vectors described above. For each subject, the modular properties which belong to the same state were averaged to present the state‐specific modular pattern. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to assess the normality of the demographic and clinical characteristics. Group differences in age, education, age at onset, epilepsy duration, seizure frequency, number of antiepileptic medications, and memory scores were determined using independent   t   test or Mann–Whitney test. Gender distribution, carbamazepine, and topiramate load between groups were compared using the χ  test. These analyses were completed using IBM SPSS version 19. \n\nFor the modular metrics and temporal properties, the   F   was initially calculated in three groups. Then, the permutation test was performed for ANOVA. We randomly reallocated all subjects to three groups with the same sample size to obtain the   F   (10,000 permutations). The observed proportions of the   F  , which was greater than   F   in the null distribution, were detected for estimating the   p   value. The post hoc analysis was conducted by adjusting on the multiple‐group level with Bonferroni correction. After multiple‐group level correction, the modular metrics of each state and temporal properties were conducted by adjusting on multiple‐metrics level FDR correction separately. Modular metrics of each state included 11 measurements (e.g., global modularity, intramodular connections, intermodular connections). Temporal properties included four measurements (e.g., fractional windows, mean dwell time, number of transitions). \n\n\n### Validation \n  \n  \nAlthough a window size in the range of 30–60 s has been widely used to capture the real variations in the brain connectivity (Allen et al.,  ; Hutchison, Womelsdorf, Allen, et al.,  ; Hutchison, Womelsdorf, Gati, Everling, & Menon,  ), a mismatch between cut‐off frequencies for filtering and the choice of the window length may cause a spurious variability of dynamic FC (Leonardi & Van De Ville,  ). To validate the stability and robustness of the results, we repeat our analysis using a sliding window approach with different window sizes (15 TRs, 30 TRs, 40 TRs, 50 TRs). \n  \nTo further investigate whether the temporal properties and modular metric differences between two patient groups depended on the side of the epileptogenic zone, the Scheirer–Ray–Hare test was used for 2 (TLE‐MI vs. TLE‐MD) × 2 (left TLE‐HS vs. right TLE‐HS) factorial ANOVA. \n  \nTo validate the robustness of dynamic network properties at the individual level, we first performed logistic regression with a backward stepwise selection to identify the most important variables that can discriminate TLE‐HS patients between TLE‐MI and TLE‐MD. The most important variables between two patient groups were selected as input for the logistic regression model. From the resulting logistic model, we conducted the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to obtain the compositive scores. The best discriminative result was identified by the Youden index. \n  \nThe logistic regression was operated to determine whether dynamic FC variables are superior to hippocampal volumetric variables for classification of TLE‐MD versus TLE‐MI. \n  \n\nThe ratio of each side hippocampal volume (HPV) divided by total intracranial volume (TIV) was estimated by individual’s structural MRI and compared between groups (see Supporting Information “Hippocampal volume analysis” section in Appendix S1 for more detail). The model performance was compared by the area under the curve (AUC) for models with significant hippocampal volumetric information only to models that also include the significant dynamic FC variables. The 95% confidence interval test with 10,000 bootstrapped samples was computed for assessing the differences between model AUCs. A superior model was identified if the 95% confidence interval for AUC was above that of the model to be compared. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Demographic profiles and memory function \n  \nThere was no difference in age or gender between TLE‐HS patients and the HC group. However, the education level was lower in TLE‐HS patients (  p   < .05). No significant differences in age, gender, duration of epilepsy, age at seizure onset, seizure frequency, number of antiepileptic drugs, or lateralization of the epileptogenic zone were observed between TLE‐MI and TLE‐MD group. Compared to TLE‐MD, TLE‐MI had more years of education (  p   < .005). The numbers of carbamazepine (  p   = .159) and topiramate (  p   = 0.335) load also did not significantly differ between TLE‐MD and TLE‐MI. Obviously, verbal memory (  p   < .0001) and nonverbal memory (  p   < .01) were significantly impaired in the TLE‐HS patients compared to HC. Moreover, the TLE‐MD group presented lower verbal and nonverbal memory scores than the TLE‐MI group (both   p   < .0001). In the TLE‐MD group, 28 patients (left, 18; right, 10) showed verbal memory impairment, and 14 patients (left, 9; right, 5) showed nonverbal memory impairment. Detailed information is shown in Table  . \n  \nSummary of demographic and clinical data \n    \n\n### Two connectivity states of the hippocampal network \n  \nThe dynamic FC was divided into two clusters that represent the transitional hippocampal network states. Figure   displays the corresponding visualized connectivity patterns (centroids of clusters) of the two common FC states: a highly modularized state (State I); and a lowly modularized state (State II). \n  \nFunctional connectivity state results. The centroid of group‐specific cluster for each state, averaged across subject‐specific median cluster centroids of each group. Respective percentages of occurrences for States I and II: 60.35 and 39.65% in the healthy controls (HC), 45.33 and 54.67% in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with memory intact (MI), 31.32 and 68.68% in TLE with memory deficit (MD). The mean global modularity of State I was higher than that of State II in each group by using paired permutation tests. Each dot represents an individual mean global modularity score. ***  p   < .001; error bars represent   SD  s. The hippocampal network is divided into anterior medial temporal lobe (MTL), posterior MTL, anterior extra‐MTL and posterior extra‐MTL.

In HC, the fractional windows in State I (60.35 ± 21.71%) was higher than State II (39.65 ± 21.71%). Compared to HC, both TLE‐HS groups showed lower fractional windows in State I and higher fractional windows in State II (all   p   < .01) (Figure  ). Additionally, we observed lower frequency of occurrence in State I and higher frequency of occurrence in State II in TLE‐MD (State I: 31.32 ± 18.36%, State II: 68.68 ± 18.36%) compared to TLE‐MI (State I: 45.33 ± 21.75%; State II: 54.67 ± 21.75%,   p   < .01). \n  \nTemporal properties analysis in two discrete functional connectivity states of the hippocampal network. (a) State I is characterized by anterior hippocampal network dominated pattern, which represents positive coupling within/between modules of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and anterior extra‐MTL. (b) State II is characterized by posterior hippocampal network dominated pattern, which represents positive coupling within posterior extra‐MTL module, as well as positive correlation between posterior extra‐MTL module and each other modules. The percentage of fractional windows (c), mean dwell time (d), and number of transitions (e) in each state is displayed for the healthy controls (HC), temporal lobe epilepsy with memory intact (TLE‐MI) patients, and TLE with memory deficit (TLE‐MD) patients. All of the significance levels were set to   p   < .05 with multiple comparisons correction. *  p   < .05, **  p   < .01, ***  p   < .001; error bars represent   SD  s. AMYG, amygdala; ANG, angular gyrus; FUS, anterior fusiform gyrus; ITC, anterior inferior temporal cortex; OFC, lateral orbitofrontal cortex; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; PHC, parahippocampal cortex; PRC, perirhinal cortex; PREC, precuneus; RSC, retrosplenial cortex \n  \nSignificant differences in the mean dwell time of each state were observed among groups (State I:   F   = 10.7984,   p   < .001; State II:   F   = 7.6450,   p   < .001). The post hoc analysis revealed that the mean dwell time of State I was shortest in TLE‐MD and longest in HC (Figure  ). Accordingly, the mean dwell time in State II was longer in the TLE‐MD group than that in HC (  p   < .005) as well as TLE‐MI (  p   < .05). No differences among groups were found in the number of transitions between states (  F   = 1.2026,   p   = .2048) (Figure  ). \n\n\n### Static and dynamic modular alteration of the hippocampal network \n  \n#### Overall modular properties \n  \nThe mean global modularity of State I was higher than that of State II in each group by using paired permutation tests (all   p   < .005) (Figure  ). A significant difference in global modularity was identified in State I among the three groups (  F   = 2.8926,   p   < .05). The mean global modularity measured in State I was lower in TLE‐MD compared to HC (  p   < .05) as well as TLE‐MI (  p   < .05). No significant difference in the global modularity was found in either static state or State II among the three groups (static state:   F   = 1.3263,   p   = .1498; State II:   F   = 1.1543,   p   = .2227). \n\n\n#### Intramodular and intermodular connections \n  \nIn static state analysis, significant group differences in intramodular communication of anterior MTL (  F   = 11.9545,   p   < .0001), posterior MTL (  F   = 11.2306,   p   < .0001), and intermodular connections between anterior and posterior MTL (  F   = 6.1897,   p   < .005) were found. Intramodular communication of anterior and posterior MTL in both patient groups was decreased (all   p   < .05). Decreased intermodular connections between anterior and posterior MTL were found in TLE‐MD relative to HC (  p   < .05) (Figure  ). \n  \nModular analysis of the hippocampal network in static state and dynamic functional connectivity states. The matrices present between‐group differences in intramodular and intermodular functional connectivity of the hippocampal network for each pair of groups in static state and two discrete functional connectivity states, respectively. The color bar indicates the change in connectivity. All of the significance levels were set to   p   < .05 with multiple comparisons correction. *  p   < .05. Ant, anterior; HC, healthy controls; MD, memory deficit; MI, memory intact; MTL, medial temporal lobe; Pos, posterior; TLE, temporal lobe epilepsy \n  \nIn State I, significant group differences in intramodular communication of anterior MTL (  F   = 7.2981,   p   < .005), posterior MTL (  F   = 6.6068,   p   < .001), and posterior extra‐MTL (  F   = 5.6142,   p   < .005) were revealed. We found common reduced intramodular communication of anterior and posterior MTL in both patient groups (all   p   < .05). Moreover, TLE‐MD showed lower intramodular connections of posterior extra‐MTL compared with TLE‐MI (  p   < .05) (Figure  ). \n\nIn State II, we found significant group differences in intramodular communication of anterior MTL (  F   = 6.0935,   p   < .0001) and posterior MTL (  F   = 9.5985,   p   < .0001). Significant group differences were also found in intermodular connectivity between anterior and posterior MTL (  F   = 3.0795,   p   < .05) and intermodular connectivity between posterior MTL and posterior extra‐MTL (  F   = 3.9456,   p   < .05). The two patient groups exhibited lower intramodular connectivity of anterior MTL than HC (  p   < .05). The TLE‐MD group had decreased intramodular connectivity within posterior MTL and intermodular connections between anterior and posterior MTL relative to HC (both   p   < .05). Additionally, the TLE‐MD group exhibited lower intermodular connectivity between posterior MTL and posterior extra‐MTL relative to the TLE‐MI group (  p   < .05) (Figure  ). \n\n\n#### Validation \n  \n  \nDynamic FC analysis identified the hippocampal network with dichotomous FC states: a highly modularized state and a lowly modularized state. These connectivity patterns of identified dynamic FC states are highly similar to the original results and across different window sizes. In addition, group comparisons on modular and temporal features of dynamic FC states keep consistent with different window sizes (see Supporting Information Figures S4–S11 in Appendix S1). \n  \nThrough identifying the differences in temporal and modular properties using the 2 × 2 factorial ANOVA, we found that there was a main effect of TLE‐MI versus TLE‐MD (fractional windows of State I:   F   = 7.6959,   p   < .01; mean dwell time of State I:   F   = 4.1655,   p   < .05; mean dwell time of State II:   F   = 4.8681,   p   < .05; intramodular connections of posterior extra‐MTL in State I:   F   = 7.9755,   p   < .005; intermodular connectivity between posterior MTL and posterior extra‐MTL in State II:   F   = 8.3179,   p   < .005), while there were no significant main effects for seizure lateralization or interaction effects (all   p   > .05). \n  \nIn the discrimination between TLE‐MI and TLE‐MD, dynamic FC variables of the dwell time in State II and intermodular FC between posterior MTL and posterior extra‐MTL were selected. The sensitivity, specificity, AUC value, and   p   value were 82.9%, 71.0%, 0.842, and   p   < .001, respectively. \n  \nThe ratio of ipsilateral HPV/TIV was significantly lower in TLE‐MD than that in TLE‐MI. In the discrimination between TLE‐MI and TLE‐MD patients, three models were compared to determine whether dynamic FC variables offer unique information for classification of memory impairment. The baseline model including the ratio of ipsilateral HPV/TIV had an AUC significantly above chance (AUC = 0.745,   p   < .05). The model including dynamic FC variables produced a lager AUC increase (AUC = 0.842) than the baseline model (  p   < .05). An additional model that included the most important dynamic FC variables as well as the ratio of ipsilateral HPV/TIV performed best (AUC = 0.876) than the other two models (both   p   < .05) (Figure  ). \n  \n  \nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) comparing model performance when discriminating temporal lobe epilepsy with memory deficit (TLE‐MD) from TLE with memory intact (TLE‐MI).

We had three main findings: (a) there are two different connectivity patterns within the hippocampal network, a high modularized state (State I) with anterior hippocampal network dominated pattern, and a low modularized state (State II) with posterior hippocampal network dominated pattern; (b) TLE was prone to drive less State I but more State II, and the tendency was more obvious in TLE‐MD; (c) TLE‐MD showed more widespread alterations of modular properties compared with TLE‐MI across two states, but the measurement was not sensitive to conventional static FC analysis. Dynamic FC approach has attracted growing attention and may be useful for studying the neural basis of cognition (Deco, Jirsa, & McIntosh,  ; Lurie et al.,  ). It has been indicted that dynamic FC may reflect language as well as memory functional capacity in TLE (Douw et al.,  ; He et al.,  ). In short, our data demonstrated that dynamic FC analysis of resting‐state fMRI provided insights into fluctuations of the hippocampal network underlying episodic memory impairment in TLE. \n\nPrevious research studies demonstrated that dynamic FC analysis could characterize brain segregated and integrated state during rest in healthy subjects and patients with neuropsychiatric disorders (de Pasquale et al.,  ; Kim et al.,  ). Both states of the default mode network were also reported (Du et al.,  ). Here, our findings revealed the hippocampal network with dichotomous FC states: a highly modularized state (State I) and a lowly modularized state (State II). State I and State II may imply this network segregation and integration. Intuitively, State I represented positive coupling within/between modules of anterior extra‐MTL and MTL; State II represent positive coupling within posterior extra‐MTL module, as well as positive correlation between posterior extra‐MTL module and each other modules. It is possible that the discrepancy in anatomical connections influence the intrinsic patterns of functional coupling, which exhibit dense communications in anterior hippocampal network via direct projections and sparse communications in posterior hippocampal network via polysynaptic projections (Poppenk & Moscovitch,  ; Ranganath & Ritchey,  ; Ritchey et al.,  ). Briefly, our data that State I had a higher mean global modularity than State II supported the hypothesis that the hippocampal network have segregated and integrated states, and we further indicated that State I was characterized by anterior hippocampal network dominated pattern, and State II was characterized by posterior hippocampal network dominated pattern. However, more evidence is required to confirm the possible mechanism. \n\nCompared to controls, both patient groups have a similar tendency characterized by a reduced occurrence of State I, paralleled by an increased expression of State II. This is in line with the changed temporal properties that patients have a decrease in the dwell time patterns of State I, as well as a corresponding increase of dwell time of State II. Overall, these observations seem to corroborate previous evidence for a selective vulnerability of anterior hippocampal networks in TLE‐HS. It is conceptually understandable that the epileptogenic network mainly occurred in anterior part of hippocampus may represent abnormalities of structure and function in the anterior hippocampal network in TLE‐HS (Barnett, Man, & McAndrews,  ; Bernasconi et al.,  ; Bernhardt, Bernasconi, Concha, & Bernasconi,  ; Scanlon et al.,  ). Neuronal loss in the hippocampus may exert a cascading effect that induces proximal and remote limbic deafferentation, which affects functional dynamics (Bernhardt et al.,  ). Thus, our observations underscored that a universal reduction in drive capability of State I due to the damaged integrity of the hippocampus. It is consistent with the result of modular connectivity in both patient groups that a common decrease of intramodular connectivity across anterior to posterior MTL in either State I or State II. This may explain the strengthened temporal dynamics (e.g., frequency and dwell time) of functional integrated State II observed in these patients, implying increased intermodular connections and a widespread integration of memory information across the hippocampal networks to reduce influence of local neural disruption. \n\nThe dichotomy of FC states revealed that a progressive imbalance of dynamic networks would aggravate memory impairment in TLE. In other words, the effect of memory preserved through increasing integrated functions is limited if there is an internal functional breakdown in MTL. Importantly, we observed the changes of modular connections across posterior hippocampal network in TLE‐MD, including a reduction of intramodular connections within posterior extra‐MTL during State I and a reduction of intermodular connections between posterior MTL and posterior extra‐MTL during State I. Previous resting fMRI studies in TLE demonstrated that a universal loss of interhemispherical and intra hemispherical FC in posterior hippocampal network reflected worse memory capacity (McCormick et al.,  ; Voets et al.,  ). Posterior hippocampal network is a part of the default mode network, which is engaged in the maintenance of self‐generated cognition and episodic memory. Relative to the anterior hippocampal network, the posterior hippocampal network dominates in maintaining episodic memory (Poppenk & Moscovitch,  ; Wang et al.,  ). In addition, it could respond to targeted stimulation as a functional unit for recollection improvement (Kim et al.,  ). Interestingly, the dwell time in State II and intermodular FC between posterior MTL and posterior extra‐MTL in State II were identified as the most differentiated variables, which were able to discriminate TLE‐MD from TLE‐MI. Collectively, our finding suggested that memory impairment reflects the breakdown of balance between segregation and integration of the hippocampal network, in which the dynamic changes of posterior hippocampal network play an important role. \n\nIn addition, our study showed that static modular analysis failed to provide adequate information in characterizing memory impairment in TLE‐HS. Memory activities require an orchestration of real‐time and continuous brain states, implying a delicate relationship between memory activities and time. Time‐dependent modular organization is more like actual brain dynamics, and is more sensitive in reflecting slight change of memory processing. Moreover, these measurements of temporal dynamics reported were helpful to reveal not only potential neural mechanisms of neuropsychiatric diseases (Damaraju et al.,  ; Jones et al.,  ; Kim et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ) but also subject‐specific cognition during resting‐state and task‐state (Taghia et al.,  ; Vidaurre, Smith, & Woolrich,  ). Indeed, our findings demonstrated that dynamic FC analysis have the advantage in providing extra temporal information of different brain states, contributing to better mark episodic memory impairment compared with static features. \n\nWe found that the ratio of ipsilateral HPV corrected by HPV/TIV was lower in TLE‐MI group than that in TLE‐MD group. The logistical regression model showed that the ratio of ipsilateral HPV/TIV could differentiate TLE‐MI and TLE‐MD patients. It is well concordance with previous finding that reduction of the HPV ties strongly to memory impairment for TLE‐HS (Dabbs et al.,  ; Hermann, Seidenberg, Lee, Chan, & Rutecki,  ). This result suggested that the pattern of the further atrophy in the epileptogenic hippocampus could characterize TLE‐MD patients. Further comparison between models showed that the model including dynamic FC variables performed better than the model including the hippocampal volumetric variable, while the model including both dynamic FC metrics and the HPV performed better than the other two models. Therefore, the model comparison demonstrated that fMRI metrics had a greater contribution to memory impairment than structural MRI metrics, and a combination of the two metric types best characterized memory impairment in TLE. \n\nWe found TLE‐MD and TLE‐MI patients had no significant difference in seizure lateralization. The TLE‐MD group included patients with either verbal memory impairment (left, 18; right, 10) or nonverbal memory impairment (left, 9; right, 5). About 52% of left TLE‐HS patients and 40% of right TLE‐HS patients were classified as MD. Additionally, there were about 50% left TLE‐HS patients and 33.3% right TLE‐HS patients presenting verbal memory impairment. The trend of distribution was in line with the findings of previous studies, verbal memory impairment was more obviously in left TLE and a considerable proportion of patients in right TLE also had verbal memory impairment (Bell et al.,  ; Giovagnoli & Avanzini,  ; Helmstaedter & Elger,  ). Moreover, nonverbal memory impairment is less lateralized than for verbal memory function, thus the structural damage in either side of the mesial temporal lobe is prone to nonverbal memory impairment (Helmstaedter, Pohl, Hufnagel, & Elger,  ; Hermann, Seidenberg, Schoenfeld, & Davies,  ; Saling,  ). Current neuroimaging evidence demonstrated that memory impairment of TLE is associated with the extensive brain network abnormalities, which may be effect by widespread epileptic discharges regardless of seizure lateralization (Dabbs et al.,  ; Rayner et al.,  ; Reyes et al.,  ). We further verified that seizure lateralization has no effects on dynamic modular reorganization in either TLE‐MD or TLE‐MI. This demonstrated that it was feasible to use the properties of dynamic changes in the hippocampal network to mark episodic memory deficits regardless of seizure lateralization. \n\n\n## LIMITATIONS \n  \nOur study has several limitations. First, the result of the model comparisons indicated that the degree of the hippocampal atrophy and alteration in dynamic FC in the hippocampal network are both independent factors for memory impairment. It is difficult to interpret whether the effect of the alternations of the network FC states on memory is regulated by the HPV. Our study warrants further study to answer this question. Second, a task‐based fMRI could further disclose the characteristics and dynamics of the hippocampal network. An fMRI study during memory processing (encoding, storage and retrieval) will help to further understand the hippocampal–cortical interaction. Third, recruiting MRI‐negative TLE may be helpful to account for whether the local neural loss in the hippocampus ties to temporal alterations of State I. Finally, this study was cross‐sectional, a longitudinal study with enlarged sample size is required to identify the relationship between dynamic FC changes in modular organization of hippocampal network and memory impairment. \n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nIn summary, this study provided a new perspective of understanding alterations in dynamic modular architecture which underlies memory phenotypes in TLE. Dynamic FC analysis of the hippocampal network identified segregated and integrated states that correspond to anterior and posterior hippocampal networks dominated patterns. The sequential intrinsic temporal and functional modular patterns in the hippocampal network were altered in TLE, and associated with memory phenotypes. The trend revealed by dynamic FC is a promising imaging marker for memory impairment in TLE. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest. \n\n\n## ETHICS STATEMENT \n  \nThis study was approved by the Medical Ethic Committee of Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. \n\n\n## PATIENT CONSENT STATEMENT \n  \nAll participants signed the informed consent forms according to the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"014e28d5dd32ba51d6e7ff8b3db2558c"},

Yet brain reconfigurations at different spatial scales are seldom explored and whether they are associated with the neural aspects of brain disorders is far from understood. In this study, we introduced a dynamic measure called step‐wise functional network reconfiguration (sFNR) to characterize how brain configuration rewires at different spatial scales. We applied sFNR to two independent datasets, one includes 160 healthy controls (HCs) and 151 patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and the other one includes 314 HCs and 255 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found that both SZ and ASD have increased whole‐brain sFNR and sFNR between cerebellar and subcortical/sensorimotor domains. At the ICN level, the abnormalities in SZ are mainly located in ICNs within subcortical, sensory, and cerebellar domains, while the abnormalities in ASD are more widespread across domains. Interestingly, the overlap SZ‐ASD abnormality in sFNR between cerebellar and sensorimotor domains was correlated with the reasoning‐problem‐solving performance in SZ (  r   = −.1652,   p   = .0058) as well as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule in ASD (  r   = .1853,   p   = .0077). Our findings suggest that dynamic reconfiguration deficits may represent a key intersecting point for SZ and ASD. The investigation of brain dynamics at different spatial scales can provide comprehensive insights into the functional reconfiguration, which might advance our knowledge of cognitive decline and other pathophysiology in brain disorders. \n  \nIn this study, we found that both schizophrenia and autism have increased whole‐brain dynamic network reconfiguration and increased dynamic network reconfiguration associated with cerebellar and subcortical/sensorimotor domains. Interestingly, the diseases' overlapping abnormality in dynamic network reconfiguration between cerebellar and sensorimotor domains was correlated with the reasoning‐problem‐solving performance in schizophrenia as well as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule in autism. Our findings suggest that dynamic functional connectivity deficits may represent a key intersecting point for schizophrenia and autism.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nEvaluating resting‐state brain connectivity from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals has expanded our knowledge of the brain function and neurophysiological mechanisms (Biswal, Zerrin Yetkin, Haughton, & Hyde,  ; Fornito & Bullmore,  ; Friston,  ; Greicius, Krasnow, Reiss, & Menon,  ). Conventionally, the analysis of resting‐state functional connectivity is based on the assumption that connectivity within a scan session is static, which unfortunately neglects the potential variations of the brain (Hutchison et al.,  ). Research using high‐temporal‐resolution imaging techniques, such as electrophysiological recordings of single cells, local fields, and surface electroencephalograms (EEGs) have observed significant fluctuations of neural activity and connectivity (Lehmann et al.,  ), which indicates that human brain might coordinate different neural populations across multiple spatiotemporal scales to adapt to the internal and external demands (Buzsáki,  ; Hutchison et al.,  ). Previous studies have reported a wide range of functional connectivity dynamics at different spatial scales, where the spatial scale indicates how the functional organization to be constructed. Those dynamic patterns include temporal variations in local regional homogeneity or specific functional connectivity pairs (Chang & Glover,  ; Deng, Sun, Cheng, & Tong,  ), zone of instability of functional networks or domains (Allen et al.,  ; Zalesky, Fornito, Cocchi, Gollo, & Breakspear,  ), and dynamic graphs and global dynamism of whole‐brain functional connectivity (Fu et al.,  ; Miller et al.,  ; Yu et al.,  ). However, previous work typically used different metrics to investigate the temporal characteristics of different functional organizations. For example, Allen et al. used a metric called zone of instability of functional networks to separate components into groups with more variable functional connectivity (Allen et al.,  ). Global dynamism measures were defined in Miller et al. ( ) for evaluating the dynamic range and fluidity of the whole‐brain. There is a need for a unified measure that can evaluate dynamic patterns of functional brain organizations constructed by different functional connectivity groups. Understanding how functional brain changes at different spatial scales provides more comprehensive information about the macro‐ and micro‐scale spatiotemporal architecture of the brain that is potentially related to human behaviors and brain disorders. \n\nSchizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are among many psychiatric and neurological disorders that share overlapping clinical features and similar brain alterations (Konstantareas & Hewitt,  ). They are both associated with cognitive problems, social withdrawal, and communication impairment, neurodevelopment alterations, and genetic mutations (Association AP,  ). Early on, they were regarded as the same disorder but in different stages, with ASD manifesting as an earlier phase of SZ (Eisenberg & Kanner,  ). Individuals with ASD are more likely to have a family history of SZ (Sullivan et al.,  ) and also have increased liability for psychosis (Kincaid, Doris, Shannon, & Mulholland,  ). Although current diagnostic approaches maintain a nosological distinction between SZ and ASD, their underlying relationship, and neural origins are far from clear. Functional connectivity derived from fMRI is one of the powerful neuroimaging techniques that allow brain configuration abnormalities to be assessed in mental disorders. Studies of brain connectivity have yielded many reliable indicators of brain disorders, with the potential to support early diagnosis and treatment (Arbabshirani, Plis, Sui, & Calhoun,  ; Greicius,  ; Koshino et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ; Whitfield‐Gabrieli et al.,  ). Both SZ and ASD have functional connectivity abnormalities as core disease features reported in previous studies. However, only a few works favor both diseases within a single study, showing most of the common and divergent connectivity alterations in default mode, salience, and motor networks (Chen, Uddin, et al.,  ; Mastrovito, Hanson, & Hanson,  ; Yoshihara et al.,  ). These studies also have limitations, given that they are based on static connectivity which unfortunately represents a gross oversimplification (Allen et al.,  ). Considering the dynamic nature of the brain, the time‐varying characteristics of functional connectivity are believed to unveil pathophysiology in brain disorders ignored by its static counterpart. Indeed, several existing studies have implied potential similar abnormalities in brain dynamics between SZ and ASD. For example, Damaraju et al. showed that SZ patients have significantly longer dwell times in sparse‐connected states and disrupted thalamocortical connectivity in a state‐specific manner (Damaraju et al.,  ). Similarly, an ASD study found that individuals with ASD have longer dwell time in the weak‐connected states and transient increased thalamic‐sensory connectivity within dynamic states (Fu et al.,  ). The larger variations of dynamic functional connectivity were identified in both SZ (Ma, Calhoun, Phlypo, & Adali,  ; Yue et al.,  ) and ASD (Chen, Nomi, Uddin, Duan, & Chen,  ; Harlalka, Bapi, Vinod, & Roy,  ), showing strong correspondence with the disease‐related hypoconnectivity. The temporal patterns in functional connectivity were suggested to help distinguish SZ from ASD and controls in a recent study (Rabany et al.,  ). The above‐mentioned findings support that studying the dynamic brain reconfiguration for these two disorders, especially from different spatial perspectives is important for clarifying the relationship between SZ and ASD in their brain dynamics, behavioral aspects, and cognitive deficits. \n\nIn this study, we first introduce a dynamic measure called step‐wise functional network reconfiguration (sFNR), which is capable of characterizing step‐wise changes in different functional organizations between adjacent time points. The novelty of the current study is twofold. First, our study used the cosine similarity to evaluate the changes in dynamic functional connectivity and then introduced the sFNR based on the step‐wise changes, a unified measure for quantifying the overall temporal characteristics of different functional brain organizations. Second, we applied the sFNR to two diseases' datasets with a large sample size for the exploration of the dynamic abnormalities in different brain organizations that are related to SZ and ASD. We hypothesize that SZ and ASD would have similar but also specific dynamic abnormalities, which are associated with diseases' traits. We adopt a novel analytical framework call Neuromark (Du et al.,  ), combined with sliding‐window correlation and sFNR to two independent datasets, namely the Function Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN) and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) to study the abnormal dynamic patterns in SZ and ASD. The relationships between abnormal dynamic reconfiguration and cognitive performance/symptoms are also investigated. The results from the two datasets are then compared to highlight similar and unique changes between SZ and ASD. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Datasets \n  \nWritten informed consent is obtained from all participants of the two independent datasets under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board. The chracteristics of these two datasets are provided in Table  . The first dataset is a SZ dataset from the FBIRN. Participants were scanned during the eyes‐closed rest condition. All resting‐state fMRI data were acquired using a standard gradient‐echo echo‐planar imaging (EPI) sequence with TE = 30 ms, TR = 2 s, FA = 77°, slice thickness = 4 mm, slice gap = 1 mm. The duration of each resting‐state scan was 5 min 24 s. Subject inclusion criteria require all participants with head motion <=3° and <=3 mm, and with functional data providing near full brain successful normalization (by comparing the individual mask with the group mask. Details are provided in the supplementary materials). These criteria yield 160 healthy controls (HCs) (average age: 37.04 ± 10.86; range: 19–59 years; 45/115: female/male) and 151 patients with SZ (average age: 38.77 ± 11.63; range: 18–62 years; 36/115: female/male). HCs and SZs are matched by age and gender (age:   p   = .1758; gender:   p   = .3912). HCs do not have any past or current psychiatric illness based on SCID assessment or a first‐degree relative with a diagnosis of an Axis‐I psychotic disorder. SZs are clinically stable at the time of scanning. Most of the participants are measured by a neuropsychological battery that includes six neurocognitive domain tests (speed processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, and problem‐solving) called Computerized Multiphasic Interactive Neurocognitive System (CMINDS) (van Erp et al.,  ). CMINDS is a reliable system to evaluate cognitive performance from different angles. \n\nThe second dataset is from the release 1.0 of the ABIDE1, a publicly available database sharing resting‐state fMRI data from individuals with ASD and HCs. Before dataset acquisition, consortium members agreed on a “base” phenotypic protocol by identifying overlaps in measures across sites, which include age, sex, IQ, and other diagnostic information. Since in this study, we focus on dynamic variations on functional network connectivity (FNC), we only select subjects with TR = 2 s to avoid inducing confounding effects from different temporal resolutions. The other subject inclusion criteria include criteria for controlling the head motion and normalization quality of data, which are similar to those for the FBIRN dataset. In total 314 HCs (average age: 17.04 ± 7.00; range: 6.47–56.20 years; 65/249: female/male) and 255 individuals with ASD (average age: 17.05 ± 7.74; range: 7.00–55.40 years; 31/224: female/male) from 10 sites are selected in this study. HCs and ASD are matched by age (age:   p   = .9901). Previous literature has demonstrated sexual differentiation for ASD which is far more prevalent in males than in females. There is gender difference (  p   = .0067) on selected HCs and ASD and we thus control for the gender by adding it as a covariate in the statistical analysis. \n  \nDemographics FBIRN and ABIDE1 datasets \n    \n\n### Preprocessing \n  \nThe fMRI data were preprocessed using the statistical parametric mapping (SPM12,  ) package in MATLAB 2016 environment. The first five scans were removed for the signal equilibrium and participants' adaptation to the scanner's noise. We performed rigid body motion correction using the toolbox in SPM to correct subject head motion, followed by the slice‐timing correction to account for timing difference in slice acquisition. The fMRI data were subsequently warped into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute space using an EPI template and were slightly resampled to 3 × 3 × 3 mm  isotropic voxels. The resampled fMRI data were further smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with a full width at half maximum = 6 mm. After the preprocessing, the FBIRN subjects have 157 scans and the ABIDE1 subjects have 145 scans used in the following analysis. \n\n\n### Functional network extraction \n  \nTo obtain the same functional network structure for both datasets, a set of network priors were first extracted by the Neuromark framework (Du et al.,  ). In this framework, spatial group ICA was performed on two independent datasets with a large sample of HCs (Human Connectome Project [HCP, 823 subjects after the subject selection] and Genomics Superstruct Project [GSP, 1005 subjects after the subject selection]). We choose these two datasets with different temporal resolutions and preprocessed by different pipelines because we would like to identify network priors that are consistent and reproducible across various conditions. \n\nFor each dataset, principal component analysis was performed to reduce the subject‐specific data into 120 principal components (PCs) which preserve more than 95% variance of the original data. The 120 PCs of each subject were concatenated across subjects and then reduced into 100 PCs at the group level. The infomax ICA algorithm was conducted to decompose the 100 PCs into 100 independent components (ICs) and such procedure was repeated 10 times in ICASSO, in which the best run was selected to ensure the estimation stability. The estimated ICs from the two datasets were then matched by comparing their corresponding group‐level spatial maps. A spatial similarity matrix S (size: 100 × 100) was obtained by computing the absolute value of Pearson correlation coefficients between spatial maps of ICs from GSP and that from HCP. Based on the matrix S, the pair of ICs with the maximum correlation value was selected and considered as the first‐matched components pair. If their original correlation value was negative, one of the ICs was sign‐flipped. After identifying a matched ICs pair, the correlation values related to them in matrix S were set to zero, resulting in a new similarity matrix S . As such, the matching procedure was repeated continually on the updated correlation matrices, until the final matched IC pair was found. IC pairs were considered to be reproducible if they show a higher spatial correlation than a given threshold. Previous studies have shown that a correlation threshold = 0.25 indicates a significant correspondence (  p   < .005, corrected) between components (Beckmann, DeLuca, Devlin, & Smith,  ; Beckmann, Mackay, Filippini, & Smith,  ). In our study, we used a larger threshold (=0.4) which promoted higher correspondence between the matched ICs from HCP and GSP. We characterized a subset of these matched ICs as ICNs, as opposed to physiological, movement‐related, or imaging artifacts. Components were evaluated by three experts' votes, which are based on the expectations that ICNs should have their activation peaks fell on gray matter and low spatial over‐lap with known vascular, ventricular, motion and some other artifacts, and should have dominant low‐frequency fluctuations on their corresponding time‐courses (TCs). \n\nWe used the less noisy ICNs captured from the GSP dataset (note that there are 53 ICNs from HCP which have similar spatial patterns) as the spatial network priors applied group‐information‐guide ICA (gig‐ICA) to back‐reconstructed subject‐specific spatial maps and TCs for the FBIRN and ABIDE1 datasets. Via using the Neuromark framework, the identified ICNs from FBIRN and ABIDE1 are corresponding, leveraging the feasibility of obtaining the same network structure across datasets. After extracting ICNs and their corresponding TCs for each dataset, ICN TCs underwent additional postprocessing to remove the remaining noise. These procedures included (a) detrending linear, quadratic, and cubic trends; (b) multiple regression of the six realignment parameters and their derivatives, (c) removal of detected outliers, and (d) low‐pass filtering with a cutoff frequency of 0.15 Hz. \n\n\n### Dynamic functional network connectivity \n  \nFor each subject, dynamic FNC (dFNC) was estimated by a sliding window approach. A tapered window, created by convolving a rectangle (width = 20 TRs = 40 s, TR = 2 s) with a Gaussian (  σ   = 3 TRs), was used to segment the TCs. We slid the window in steps of 1 TR, resulting in total   W   = 137 windows for the FBIRN subjects and   W   = 125 for the ABIDE subjects. It is suggested that window size between 30 s and 1 min produces reliable dynamic functional connectivity estimates (Hutchison et al.,  ). Robust dynamic functional connectivity patterns have been well identified using the sliding window approach with a similar window (Allen, Damaraju, Eichele, Wu, & Calhoun,  ; Fiorenzato et al.,  ; Fu et al.,  ; Hutchison et al.,  ; Tu et al.,  ; Zalesky et al.,  ). To further show the reliability of our results, we also calculated the dFNC using a wide range of window sizes (16–24 TRs) and provided the results in the supplementary materials. Considering that the short time segment may not have sufficient information to characterize the full covariance matrix, we estimate covariance from the regularized precision matrix, which is calculated via the graphical LASSO method (Friedman, Hastie, & Tibshirani,  ) on the windowed data. The regularization parameter was optimized for each subject by using a cross‐validation framework. \n\n\n### Calculation of   sFNR  \n  \nConsider two matrices A and B with dimension N × M, where each entry represents the link between nodes. The distance between these two matrices can be defined as: where   is the cosine similarity function calculating as (Han & Goetz,  ): here   J   is a 1 × N vector with 1 for each element and ∘ is the Hadamard product.   is the Frobenius norm and   is the Euclidean norm. Therefore, if A presents a network of previous time point (  t  ‐1) and   B   represents a network of current time point (  t  ), the sFNR of this time point (  t  ) can be measured by the distance between them. The sFNR   is calculated for each time point to evaluate how the functional network reconfigures time by time (so called step‐wise). In addition, sFNR is within the scope 0–1, allowing us to compare it across different networks and across groups, where a larger value of   indicates the greater network reconfiguration. \n\nThe dFNC of each window were concatenated to form a C × C × W array (C: number of ICNs; W: number of windows), representing the changes in brain connectivity as a function of time. We calculated sFNR of brain for: (a) whole‐brain, based on C × C × W dFNC array; (b) domain, based on C  × C  × W dFNC array, where C  × C  of each time window presents FNC between domains i and j or within domain i if i = j; and (c) ICN, based on 1 × (C‐1) × W dFNC array, where 1 × (C‐1) represents FNC between a given ICN and the other ICNs. For each subject, the outputs of this procedure are a (W‐1) × 1 sFNR vector for the whole‐brain, a L × (W‐1) sFNR array for the domain level where L = (D + 1) × D ÷ 2 (D denotes the number of domain), and a C × (W‐1) sFNR array for the ICN level. The output sFNR is then averaged across windows (W‐1) to obtain the overall FNR during the resting‐state. sFNR is then averaged across windows for further analysis. A general linear model (GLM) was applied to examine whether the average sFNR shows differences between SZ and HC, controlling for age and gender. The GLM was also applied to examine the group difference between ASD and HC on the average sFNR, controlling for age, gender, and site. Different from the FBIRN data that were scanned using the same structural and functional scan parameters (e.g., data length, TR/TE, and slice order), the data from ABIDE are scanned using different protocols which could result in more systematic differences between subjects from different sites. Therefore, for controlling for the multisites effect, we generated a Subject × (  N  ‐1) array as the input covariate in the GLM analysis, where the N is supposed to be the total number of sites in this data. For each column i = 1, 2, …,   N  ‐1, if a subject is from site i, the entry (sub,   i  ) of this array is set as 1, otherwise, the entry would be set as 0. To further show that the site information in the FBIRN data would not influence our findings, we also controlled for the site effect in the statistical analysis between SZ and HCs and provided the results in the supplementary materials. To further investigate the associations between the atypical sFNR and cognitive performance and symptoms, the GLM was used to examine the association between abnormal sFNR and CMIND scores for the FBIRN dataset and the association between abnormal sFNR and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) for the ABIDE1 dataset, controlling for additional diagnosis effect. Statistical results were corrected using Bonferroni correction (Dunnett,  ) or false discovery rate (FDR) correction (Benjamini & Hochberg,  ). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Neuromark   ICNs  \n  \nThen, 53 ICNs were identified by the Neuromark pipeline, with the activation peaks fell on the majority of subcortical and cortical gray matter. According to prior functional and anatomical information, ICNs are arranged into seven functional domains: subcortical (SC), auditory (AUD), visual (VS), sensorimotor (SM), cognitive‐control (CC), default‐mode (DM), and cerebellar (CB) domains. The spatial maps, component labels, and peak coordinates of ICNs are provided in the supplementary material. \n\n\n### Increased   sFNR   in   SZ  \n  \nCompared with HC, SZ has increased sFNR of the brain at different scales. Specifically, sFNR of the whole‐brain significantly increases in SZ (  p   = 1.26 e‐4; Figure  ). Within‐domain sFNR is smaller than between‐domain sFNR, suggesting more nonstationary properties in the FNC between different functional modules. Greater sFNR are identified between SC and SM/VS/CB domains, between CB and SM/CC/DM domains and within CB domains (***significance   p   < .01, Bonferroni corrected; Figure  ) in SZ. The SC, SM, and CB domains are the dominant functional modules that are associated with increased sFNR in SZ. For the sFNR at the ICN level, ICNs within CC domain are less stable while the ICNs within sensory domains (AUD, SM, and VS) are more stationary. However, it could be also observed increased sFNR in several sensory ICNs, indicating more nonstationary relationships between them and the other ICNs. For example, the postcentral gyrus (PoCG) and the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) have a relatively higher degree of sFNR (Figure  ). ICNs within SC domain (including caudate, subthalamus, thalamus), AUD domain (including superior temporal gyrus [STG]), SM domain (including PoCG, paracentral lobule [ParaCL], superior parietal lobule [SPL]), VS domain (calcarine gyrus), and CB domain show greater sFNR in SZ (**significance   p   < .05, Bonferroni corrected; Figure  ). Most abnormalities are concentrated in SC, CB, and sensory domains. \n  \nsFNR abnormalities in SZ. (a) Difference in the whole‐brain sFNR between HCs and SZ.

HC, healthy control; ICN, intrinsic connectivity network; sFNR, step‐wise functional network reconfiguration; SZ, schizophrenia \n  \n\n### Increased   sFNR   in   ASD  \n  \nSimilar sFNR changes are identified in ASD. Specifically, individuals with ASD show a higher degree of whole‐brain sFNR (  p   = 4.04 e‐4; Figure  ). The whole‐brain sFNR is associated with ADOS (  p   = .0136). At the domain level, within‐domain sFNR is relatively smaller than between‐domain sFNR, which is consistent with the findings from FBIRN. Individuals with ASD show similar alterations in sFNR between CB and SC/SM domains, but the significance level is weaker (*significance   p   < .05, FDR corrected; Figure  ). ASD also has specific sFNR changes, mainly between SM and AUD/VS and between CC and DM (*significance   p   < .05, FDR corrected; Figure  ). Similar to SZ, the SM and CB are the most affected functional domains. However, the SC domain is less affected in ASD. The sFNR of ICNs shows similar distribution patterns in both FBIRN and ABIDE1 datasets. For instance, ICNs within CC have relatively higher sFNR. PoCG and MTG have higher sFNR compared with the other ICNs within the sensory domains (Figure  ). Different from the SZ, individuals with ASD have altered sFNR widespread across domains. ICNs within SC domain (thalamus), SM domain (precentral gyrus [PreCG], PoCG, and ParaCL), VS domain (MTG, middle occipital gyrus [MOG], and inferior occipital gyrus [IOG]), CC domain (inferior parietal lobule [IPL]), DM domain (posterior cingulate cortex) and CB domain show greater sFNR in ASD (*significance   p   < .05, FDR corrected; Figure  ). \n  \nsFNR abnormalities in ASD. (a) Difference in the whole‐brain sFNR between HCs and individuals with ASD. (b) Average within/between‐domain sFNR across all subjects. (c) Difference in between‐domain sFNR between HC and ASD.

The score of reasoning‐problem‐solving is negatively correlated with the sFNR between SM and CB domains and the sFNR of SPL (*significance   p   < .05, FDR corrected; Figure  ), indicating that the poorer cognitive performance in SZ is accompanied with the larger sFNR. An interesting patterns between SZ and ASD is that the sFNR between SM and CB domains is also positively correlated with ADOS in ASD (*significance   p   < .05, FDR corrected; Figure  ). We also found a significant association at the ICN level (ADOS is associated with the sFNR of thalamus, *significance   p   < .05, FDR corrected), as compared with the findings in SZ (cognitive performance is associated with the sFNR of SPL). We also correlated the abnormal sFNC measures with the head motion parameter as measured by the mean framewise displacement and there is no significant correlation between them (  p   > .05), indicating that such abnormalities are not due to the potential confounding effects from head motion. \n  \nCorrelations between sFNR and reasoning‐problem‐solving score/ADOS. Two sFNR calculations show negative correlations with reasoning‐problem‐solving and two sFNR calculations show positive correlations with ADOS: (a) sFNR between SM and CB domains in SZ; (b) sFNR of SPL in SZ; (c) sFNR between SM and CB domains in ASD; and (d) sFNR of thalamus in ASD. Each dot represents the value of each subject and the black line represents the relationship between sFNR and score. *Significance   p   < .05, FDR corrected. ADOS, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule; ASD, autism spectrum disorder; CB, cerebellar domain; sFNR, step‐wise functional network reconfiguration; SM, sensorimotor domain; SPL, superior parietal lobule; SZ, schizophrenia \n  \n\n### Overlapping and unique abnormalities in   SZ   and   ASD  \n  \nAt the whole‐brain level, both SZ and ASD show increased functional reconfiguration compared with HCs. At the within/between‐domain level, SZ and ASD have overlapping abnormalities as increased functional reconfiguration between CB and SC domains, and between CB and SM domains. SZ has unique abnormal sFNR between SC and SM/VS domains, between CB and CC/DM domains, and within CB domain. ASD has unique abnormalities in sFNR between SM and AUD/VS domains and between CC and DM domains. At the ICN level, although the abnormalities in ASD are more wide‐spread, SZ and ASD share overlapping sFNR abnormalities related to the ICNs mainly located in the SC, SM, and CB domain, consistent with the results at the domain level. Increased sFNR identified in both diseases is involved in thalamus, left and right PoCG, ParaCL, and cerebellum. SZ shows a unique increase in sFNR related to caudate, subthalamus, STG, SPL, and calcarine gyrus while ASD shows a unique increase in sFNR related to PreCG, MTG, MOG, IOG, and left IPL. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this study, we found that the functional brain reconfiguration significantly differs between groups, being higher in ASD and SZ patients. Functional domains with a higher degree of reconfiguration are mainly associated with sensorimotor and cerebellar systems. Interestingly, the increased reconfiguration in both diseases is associated with more sever symptom traits as well as poorer cognitive performance. Collectively, our findings suggest that characterizing the brain reconfiguration at different spatial scales might be a crucial piece in providing a comprehensive picture of brain dynamics. \n\n### Abnormal whole‐brain network reconfiguration \n  \nNetwork rewiring measures have been successfully employed to multiple networks and detect reliable network reconfigurations (Han & Goetz,  ). Existing approaches, like Dynamic Graphical Model (DGM) (Schwab et al.,  ) and Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME) (Gates & Molenaar,  ), have been widely used in fMRI studies to capture the connectivity structure during the resting‐state. However, there are two major differences between our method and these approaches. First, DGM and GIMME are used to describe instantaneous directed relationships between brain regions. They are more focusing on effective connectivity, which indicates the causal relationships between brain regions with systematic lags. Instead, our method is focusing on the undirected functional connectivity, which is represented by the statistical dependence between brain regions without any lags. Second, DGM and GIMME do not consider any time‐varying experimental conditions or designed input and favor only constant or consistent relationships between brain regions during the whole scan. In contrast, our method evaluates how a group of functional connectivity varies time by time and is capable of quantifying the temporal characteristics of different functional brain organizations. Multiple lines of evidence suggest the existence of covarying patterns in functional connectivity (Allen et al.,  ; Liu & Duyn,  ; Liu, Zhang, Chang, & Duyn,  ), which indicates that measuring the dynamics in each functional connectivity independently and simply averaging them across functional connectivity might not enough to capture the real dynamic fluctuations of a functional organization constructed by a group of functional connectivity. Compared with the metrics like the   SD   of sliding‐window correlation and nonstationarity test statistic in (Zalesky et al.,  ), the sFNR evaluates the changes of a group of functional connectivity simultaneously and is capable of capturing the global dynamism of functional organization directly. The sFNR also shows advantages to the clustering‐based approaches, which assume that certain connectivity patterns may reoccur over time and are present in numerous subjects (Allen et al.,  ). The difference between the number of clusters and even between the brain state patterns due to the use of the clustering‐based approaches makes it difficult to compare findings across studies or diseases. In contrast, by combining with the Neuromark framework, the sFNR can be easily applied to different data with the feasibility of comparing findings from different datasets without the need for matching the dynamic brain states. In addition, the sFNR can evaluate the dynamic properties at different spatial scales, while the clustering‐based approaches are typically used to capturing the dynamic characteristics of the whole‐brain. \n\nUsing the average sFNR, we found that SZ has larger whole‐brain reconfiguration. Functional dysconnectivity has been widely reported in SZ but the root cause is still unclear. The finding of larger functional network variability indicates temporal disorganization of sequentially expressed dynamic connectivity, which might be a potential cause of the formulations of dysconnectivity (Breakspear & Stam,  ). Our observed increased relatively high‐frequency (step‐wise) network reconfiguration might be supported by a previous study from a high‐temporal resolution technique magnetoencephalography (Siebenhühner, Weiss, Coppola, Weinberger, & Bassett,  ). They showed that during a two‐back working memory task, SZ patients exhibit more network topology variability across trials. Resting‐state is a unconstrained condition which might contain different mental processes associating with different connectivity patterns (Allen et al.,  ; Marusak et al.,  ). Each mental process can be regarded as a single activity trail and SZ patients might also have increased network reconfiguration/variability in the resting‐state as they did in the memory task. Similar dynamic patterns are observed in an EEG study, in which an increased entropy of high‐frequency connectivity are identified in SZ (Schoen, Chang, Lee, Bob, & Mashour,  ). Larger whole‐brain reconfiguration in ASD is observed in our study as well, indicating overlapping dynamic abnormalities between ASD and SZ. Higher temporal variability of pair‐wise functional connectivity has been previously identified in ASD (Chen, Nomi, et al.,  ; Falahpour et al.,  ). Our results are consistent with these findings and further indicate an increased global reconfiguration of functional brain. The greater network reconfiguration might provide evidence that the overall brain network is not actually “disrupted” in both diseases but exhibit more unstable patterns over time. \n\nThe increased whole‐brain reconfiguration in SZ and ASD can also be explained by the excessive neural variability in brain disorders (Markram & Markram,  ; Simmons et al.,  ). Excessive trial‐to‐trial variability of brain responses is widely observed in both diseases, which are suggested to be strong evidence of excessive neural variability in brain disorders (Dinstein et al.,  ; Dinstein et al.,  ; Siebenhühner et al.,  ). We argue that the larger brain network reconfiguration might be an alternative representation of excessive neural variability. The highly fluctuated brain organization would result in unstable communications between brain areas, so that influences the perception of the environment (Dinstein, Heeger, & Behrmann,  ). As such, patients may have difficulties to interact with external stimuli and therefore exhibit specific behavioral symptoms and cognitive decline. \n\n\n### Abnormal network reconfiguration in functional domains and   ICNs  \n  \nAbnormal functional reconfiguration was identified in functional domains and ICNs in both disorders. Specifically, SZ shows increased reconfiguration within and between subcortical, sensory and cerebellar domains. The more nonstationary patterns in the functional connectivity between subcortical and cortical regions in SZ might indicate the inability of the brain to sustain the connections between subcortical‐sensory‐cerebellar domains necessary for healthy cognitive function, which might empirically result in the fragmentation of cortical and subcortical networks seen in patients (van den Berg, Gong, Breakspear, & van Leeuwen,  ). \n\nAbnormal brain connectivity is one of the major pathophysiological mechanisms of SZ (Bullmore, Frangou, & Murray,  ). Numerous brain regions involved in temporal, parietal, subcortical, and cerebellar networks and the associated functional connectivity have been linked to SZ and their alterations are suggested to play vital roles in the pathophysiology of this disease (Jafri, Pearlson, Stevens, & Calhoun,  ; Jones et al.,  ; Ma et al.,  ). Our results provide supports for these findings and further suggest the importance of evaluating the temporal changes in these brain networks and their connectivity. Increased spatial diversity and complexity of the functional organization are also key abnormities in SZ, being highly sensitive to the disease state (Bassett, Nelson, Mueller, Camchong, & Lim,  ; Lynall et al.,  ). The higher network reconfiguration observed in our study might be complementary results to these previous findings by revealing the increased temporal diversity of functional organization in SZ. Besides, the observed greater network reconfiguration between a single ICN and the rest of the brain seems compatible with the reduced homogeneity of regional activity found in SZ (Liu et al.,  ), given that the regions with dissimilar activities might have weaker and more nonstationary connectivity, resulting in higher network variability. \n\nSimilar but weaker brain alterations were identified in ASD in our study. Our results are in line with the observations that both SZ and ASD displayed atypical temporal patterns, but the SZ showed more pervasive abnormalities (Rabany et al.,  ). The domain level sFNR abnormalities in ASD are mainly associated with sensorimotor and cerebellar domains. The increased cerebral activity but decreased cerebellar activity in ASD has been documented in literature (Mostofsky et al.,  ; Müller, Kleinhans, Kemmotsu, Pierce, & Courchesne,  ). One possible explanation of such cerebral‐cerebellar dissociation can be the underconnectivity between those brain regions (Mostofsky et al.,  ). Our findings suggest that the more variable connectivity between these functional domains might be another potential cause of such cerebral‐cerebellar dissociation. That is, given the more unstable communication between the cerebellum and sensorimotor areas, their information exchange will be less reliable. Therefore, it may be more efficient for ASD to utilize these regions as independent processors, rather than having them working together (Mostofsky et al.,  ). The results of ICN sFNR indicate different patterns of abnormalities between SZ and ASD. Compared with SZ, ASD has atypical reconfiguration on ICNs widespread domains. We speculated that is because ASD influences more variety of brain systems, which might be related to the more diverse social skill, attention switching and communication problem in this disease (Spek & Wouters,  ). \n\n\n### Correlation between network reconfiguration and cognition/symptoms \n  \nIn this study, we characterized convergent and divergent brain abnormalities in SZ and ASD which are associated with the cognitive decline and autistic symptoms. On the one hand, higher network reconfiguration between sensorimotor and cerebellar domains in both diseases is correlated with reasoning problem‐solving from the SZ dataset and ADOS from the ASD dataset. Although the sensory and cerebellar domains were previously regarded to be involved in sensory and motor functions, there is a wide recognition that they are also associated with cognitive processing and behaviors (Cerliani et al.,  ; Schmahmann & Caplan,  ). Cerebellum, which was considered as a coordinator of motor function for many years, has been shown to also play an important role in cognitive functions and emotion processing based on the evidence from anatomical, clinical, and neuroimaging data (Schmahmann & Caplan,  ; Stoodley,  ). The functional connectivity abnormalities in sensory networks are also suggested to be linked to the difficulties in inhibiting repetitive behaviors in ASD (Cerliani et al.,  ). Anatomical and physiological studies show that the cerebellum receives information from the sensory systems, indicating a strong interaction between the cerebellar and sensorimotor domains. SZ and ASD are well‐recognized as disorders with deficits in cognitive and sensory processing (Javitt & Freedman,  ; Sinclair, Oranje, Razak, Siegel, & Schmid,  ), representing by hyporesponsiveness or hyperresponsiveness to sensory stimuli (Acevedo, Aron, Pospos, & Jessen,  ). Our results are compatible with the idea of relationships between cognitive/sensory processing and sensory/cerebellum abnormalities and provide further evidence supporting that the cerebellum and sensory systems are highly involved in cognition and behaviors. We speculated that the impaired cognitive and sensory processing in both diseases might be stem from deficits in sensory gating in patients. These deficits appear to be rooted in the similar unstable information flow between the cerebellum and sensorimotor cortex, as reflected by greater network reconfiguration between these functional domains. \n\nOn the other hand, sFNR at the ICN level shows divergence between SZ and ASD. Although the reconfiguration of thalamus‐connectivity increases in both SZ and ASD, it is only correlated with ADOS, not with the reasoning‐problem‐solving. Thalamus is a brain hub that receives and delivers information from‐to the whole‐brain. Atypical thalamocortical connectivity has been reported in both SZ and ASD, suggesting an overall impairment of thalamic pathways in two diseases (Andreasen, Paradiso, & O'Leary,  ; Cerliani et al.,  ). Our findings are consistent with these observations but provide additional information that the thalamus alteration in SZ and ASD might underly different mechanisms, given that it is only associated with autistic traits in ASD, not with cognitive deficits in SZ. \n\nThe identified correlations between network reconfiguration and cognition/symptoms in this study are not voodoo due to the following reasons. First, we did not calculate the mean of those high correlations resulted from the nonindependent analysis, which is assumed as the major biased analysis that produces high correlations (Vul et al.,  ). Second, when performing the correlation analysis, we carefully controlled for age, gender, site, and diagnosis to make sure the results are not biased by these potential confounding effects. Our results were also replicated by using only the adult subjects from the ABIDE1 dataset. Third, we repeated our analysis using different window sizes (16–24 TRs) and the correlations were consistently observed within a wide range of window sizes. \n\n\n### Limitation and future direction \n  \nThere are several limitations to this study. First, the drowsiness levels of participants might a potential confounding effect on the group differential functional network variability (Allen et al.,  ). Patients with SZ and ASD may have different levels of vigilance during the resting‐state scan, which might introduce unpredictable influence on our observations. Future studies can include cardiac, respiratory, and eye‐tracking techniques to monitor vigilance conditions during the scans. The medication history would be another confounding effect of the analysis. In our present study, we correlated the abnormal dynamic features in SZ and chlorpromazine, an antipsychotic medication used to treat psychotic disorders such as SZ and there is no significant correlation between them. More analysis on the influence of medication would be favored in our future studies. \n\nSecond, our study used two independent datasets that are collected from different databases. They have significantly different gender proportions and age ranges. Although the analysis was carefully performed on the patients and controls respectively, these confounding effects such as age, gender, and scanners might still potentially influence the results. In future work, our results should be validated by using the dataset with HCs, ASD patients, and SZ patients' data matched by age, gender, and scanners. We can also make direct comparisons between SZ and ASD, which will help to better elucidate the relationship between them. \n\nThird, our study only focused on the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD and SZ. In addition to these deficits, impairments in motor function are also identified in ASD and SZ patients, which are typically interpreted as secondary phenomena for diagnosis (Huston, Shakow, & Riggs,  ; Jansiewicz et al.,  ; Manschreck,  ; Miller, Chukoskie, Zinni, Townsend, & Trauner,  ; Shakow & Huston,  ). Motor deficits and their relationship with abnormal dynamic functional connectivity as well as the treatment effects could be an interesting point and should be evaluated by future studies with the motor performance recorded. \n\nIt can be also an interesting point to investigate the transient heterogeneity/homogeneity of functional connectivity within a functional organization with atypical temporal patterns. In the future, by combining with the clustering‐based analysis (Allen et al.,  ; Allen et al.,  ; Fu et al.,  ; Fu et al.,  ), we can investigate whether a functional organization with atypical sFNR is associated with the transient increased or decreased functional connectivity within this functional organization in a specific brain state. \n\n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors declare no conflict of interests. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \n Zening Fu  ,   Yuhui Du  , and   Vince D.

All subjects underwent resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI).

Furthermore, after chemotherapy, the lung cancer patients showed significantly reduced dFC variability between the right DLPFC and right precuneus compared with HCs. In addition, the decreased dFC between the right DLPFC and left SFG in the lung cancer patients after chemotherapy in state 1 and between the right DLPFC and left insula in the lung cancer patients before chemotherapy in state 2 were negatively correlated with MoCA scores ((r = -0.520,   p   = 0.039; r = -0.548,   p   = 0.028, respectively). \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur results reveal that dynamic connectivity analysis is more effective and sensitive than methods that assume static brain states for linking brain FC patterns and chemotherapy. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAccompanying the increasing morbidity (ranking first among globally diagnosed cancers (Bray et al.  )) and overall survival rate of lung cancer, chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) in lung cancer has become a well-recognized side effect during and after adjuvant chemotherapy treatment (Janelsins et al.  ). Platinum-based chemotherapy was a broadly used global standard of care for advanced lung cancer(Ettinger et al.  ; Scagliotti et al.  ). Kaasa et al. ( ) indicated that non-small cell lung cancer patients exhibited cognitive deficits as soon as one month after adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Longitudinal neuropsychological assessment research studies (Janelsins et al.  ) suggest that up to 75% of cancer patients experience multiple-domain CRCI, particularly impairments in executive functions, attention, memory and processing speed, during treatment and up to 35% experience persistent CRCI for months or years following treatment completion (Grosshans et al.  ; Janelsins et al.  ; Li and Caeyenberghs  ; Mandelblatt et al.  ; Pergolizzi et al.  ). As a major component of advanced cognitive functions, executive functions are vital to human autonomy and are a major determinant of problem behaviors and disabilities (Royall et al.  ) that incorporate and command more basic cognitive processes (Baddeley  ; Funahashi and Andreau  ; Jodzio and Biechowska  ). Improving our understanding of the changes that occur in executive function-related neurological mechanisms in lung cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy might be conducive to adjusting treatment regimens appropriately and achieving better functional improvements. \n\nRemarkably, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has been proved as a powerful noninvasive method for examining the brain functional network. rs-fMRI evaluates the temporal correlation of intrinsic low-frequency fluctuations based on blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals between brain regions during rest(Rosazza and Minati  ). In practice, using this technique, functional connectivity studies have reported a number of resting-state networks (RSNs) that consist of anatomically separated, but functionally connected regions displaying a high level of correlated BOLD signal activity(van den Heuvel et al.  ; Van Dijk et al.  ), and the corroborated executive control network (ECN) mainly involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) (Bressler and Menon  ; Shirer et al.  ; Weiland et al.  ). Recently, a neuroimaging community report showing the altered FC of the ECN in cancer patients during and after chemotherapy has gained increasing attention. Piccirillo et al. (Piccirillo et al.  ) focused on the FC changes in the frontoparietal network and the cingulo-opercular executive control network in breast cancer patients using a case-control design. Their findings indicated that the standard therapeutic levels of chemotherapy in breast cancer resulted in disrupted FC in the brain networks supporting attention and executive control function. Furthermore, Shelli and colleagues (Kesler et al.  ) examined differences in prefrontal regions between breast cancer patients received chemotherapy or not and healthy controls. The findings demonstrated hypoactivation in the left medial dorsolateral prefrontal lobe and premotor cortex in breast cancer patients received chemotherapy compared with the healthy controls. \n\nNevertheless, the aforementioned studies on the FC patterns of the ECN in cancer patients after chemotherapy assumed that FC was stationary during the process of scanning, which is referred to as static FC (sFC). Studies have displayed that the resting brain is an extremely dynamic system and that the functional connectivity states of human brain vary over time (Allen et al.  ; Hutchison et al.  ). Thus, the sFC approach has distinct limitations in reflecting dynamic brain processes. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis overcomes this static restriction and can reflect the time-varying patterns and temporal dynamic characteristics of FC (Hutchison et al.  ). Studies have shown that dFC analysis produces more sensitive results than sFC analysis for identifying group differences between healthy controls and patients with various neurological diseases (Chen et al.  ; Fu et al.  ; Yang et al.  ). Notably, a previous study (Kesler et al.  ) demonstrated that functional dynamics were distinctly lower in breast cancer patients than in control participants. \n\nPrevious studies on CRCI in lung cancer have mainly concentrated on brain structure changes and default mode network disruption (Bromis et al.  ; Simo et al.  ,  ,  ; Welzel et al.  ). Bromis et al. ( ) found significant FC disruptions within all the rest-state networks of lung cancer patients after chemotherapy compared with the healthy controls. Additionally, other results suggest that the reduced rest-state FC pattern within the default mode network (DMN) and the cognitive disorder were associated with cancer and chemotherapy in lung cancer patients (Simo et al.  ; Zhang et al.  ). Unfortunately, executive function disorders related to cancer and chemotherapy in the lung cancer patient population remain poorly understood, and further explorations are urgently necessary. \n\nThe present study aimed to investigate cancer- and chemotherapy-related intrinsic sFC and dFC differences within the ECN in rs-fMRI employing the seed-based approach in lung cancer survivors. The prefrontal cortex has been demonstrated to be an important structure for executive functions(Funahashi and Andreau  ). Moreover, the DLPFC, in the middle frontal gyrus, which is the core node of the ECN, is involved in functions including working memory, prospective memory and executive function (Mitchell et al.  ; Pochon et al.  ). Based on previous neuroimaging findings, we selected the bilateral DLPFC as the critical seed region and hypothesized that (1) sFC and dFC patterns in the DLPFC are significantly functionally disrupted in lung cancer patients after chemotherapy and (2) that altered sFC or dFC was associated with cognitive performance in lung cancer patients. As far as we know, this is the first longitudinal study to explore links between sFC and dFC changes in ECN patterns and chemotherapy in the lung cancer patient population. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe prospective study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Nanjing Medical University, and all subjects signed informed consent before their participation in the study protocol. \n\nThis was a longitudinal study of lung cancer patients scheduled to incorporate scans at baseline (t0) and three to six months (t1) after receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and to include age/sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Eighteen lung cancer patients from the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Nanjing First Hospital and 21 healthy controls (aged between 48 and 70 years, received at least 6 years of education) were enrolled through online advertisements and age, sex, and education level-matched between May 2018 and August 2019. All participants were right-handed. Among the patients treated with chemotherapy (platinum-based doublet with pemetrexed), 10 patients received cisplatin-based therapy, and 8 patients received carboplatin-based therapy for three to six months. No participants were excluded from the fMRI analysis because of excessive head motion during scanning. The exclusion criteria for all participants were: receipt prophylactic cranial irradiation; presence of a metastatic brain tumor; declared history of known stroke, craniocerebral trauma, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, other acute psychiatric or neurological illnesses; presence of a major medical illness (e.g., anemia, severe heart diseases, thyroid dysfunction or abnormality in liver or kidney function); and presence of severe vision or hearing loss. The neuropsychological status and general cognitive function of the participants were established using the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) (Galea and Woodward  ) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Nasreddine et al.  ). \n\n\n### MRI acquisition \n  \nAll MRI data were acquired in 3.0 T MRI scanner (Ingenia, Philips Medical Systems, Netherlands) with an 8-channel receiver array head coil and parallel imaging was employed. Tight but comfortable foam padding was used to minimize head motion, and earplugs were used to alleviate scanner noise. Subjects were instructed to lie with their eyes closed and stay awake, to not thinking things in particular. For each participant, routine MRI sequences, including thick-slice T2- and T1-weighted imaging as well as T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, were performed to ensure that there were no visible brain lesions or brain metastases. \n\nThe resting state fMRI data were obtained with the gradient echo-planar imaging sequence as follows: repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms; echo time (TE) = 30 ms; slices = 36; thickness = 4 mm; gap = 0 mm; field of view (FOV) = 240 mm × 240 mm; acquisition matrix = 64 × 64; and flip angle (FA) = 90°. High-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted images (3D-T1WI) data were acquired with magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence as follows: TR = 8.1 ms; TE = 3.7 ms; slices = 170; thickness = 1 mm; gap = 0 mm; FA = 8°; acquisition matrix = 256 × 256; and FOV = 256 mm × 256 mm. The resting state fMRI sequence lasted 488 s, and the structural sequence lasted 329 s. \n\n\n### Data preprocessing \n  \nFunctional preprocessing was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8;  ) and the Graph Theoretical Network Analysis Toolbox for Imaging Connectomics (GRETNA) (Wang et al.  ) (2.0.0A  ). The processing pipeline included the following stages: (i) The first 10 volumes were discarded to calculate the time required for participants to adapt to the scanning environment. (ii) Slice timing corrected and realigned were performed for the remaining 220 images, and head motion > 2.0-mm in each direction or rotation angle > 2.0° were removed from analysis. (iii) The remaining dataset was normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) EPI template (reslicing voxel size as 3 × 3 mm ). (iv) Spatially smoothing with a Gaussian kernel [6 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM)]. (v) Detrending and filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz) were performed in turn. Subsequently, several nuisance signals including head motion, the global mean, and signals from white matter (WM) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were regressed from the data. \n\n\n### Static FC analysis \n  \nThe seed regions in the bilateral DLPFC were extracted from the Brodmann template using WFU Pick Atlas software (Maldjian et al.  ). For sFC analysis, the mean time series of the signal in the bilateral DLPFC were obtained to serve as the seed time course, and the Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were finally calculated between the mean time series of each seed region and all brain voxel time series. Finally, a Fisher’s z-transform was used to obtain variables approximating a normal distribution (Lowe et al.  ). \n\n\n### Dynamic FC analysis \n  \nDynamic FC analysis was performed using the Dynamic Brain Connectome (Dynamic BC) toolbox (Liao et al.  ) (V2.1  ). Temporal dynamic patterns were characterized by using a sliding-window approach, which was created by convolving a rectangle with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 3TRs). Previous studies have revealed that a frequency interval of [0 − 1/w] Hz should be the target due to the low-pass filtering effect of the window and that the minimum window length should be above 1/f  (Leonardi and Van De Ville  ). Some researchers have applied a sliding-window length of as small as 10 s (Thompson et al.  ) and as long as 180 s (Gonzalez-Castillo et al.  ). Thus, the window size was chosen to be 20 TRs (40 s), and the window overlap was selected to be 95% (window-shifting step size of 1 TR), resulting in W = 201 windows (Chen et al.  ). The temporal correlation coefficient between the time courses of each seed and that for the other brain voxels was calculated for each sliding window. For each subject, a range of sliding-window correlation maps was acquired. To characterize the time variability in FC, the standard deviation of each voxel across a number of windows was calculated and the Fisher Z-transformed used to acquire variables similar to a normal distribution (Liao et al.  ). \n\n\n### Clustering analysis \n  \nTo assess reoccurring dFC patterns, a k-means clustering algorithm was used to analyze dFC estimates of all subjects (combining the lung cancer and HC groups) (Allen et al.  ). We used the L1 distance function to assess the similarity between sliding window FCs, as L1 distance has been proved to be an effective measurement method for high-dimensional data (Aggarwal et al.  ; Allen et al.  ). We determined the number of clusters to be three using the elbow criterion of the cluster validity index, which is computed as the ratio between the within-cluster distance and between-cluster distance. The gained clustering centroids were then served as the departure points to cluster all dFC windows from all subjects. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nSPSS software (version 19.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analyses, and a corrected statistically significance level of p < 0.05 was obtained. Group comparisons of demographic information or clinical measures were performed using two-sample t-tests to compare continuous data between the lung cancer groups and HC group. \n\nA one-sample t-test was performed to analyze individual sFC maps in a voxel wise manner. The test was used to determine the sFC patterns in regions with significant connectivity to the specific seeds in each group. Two-sample t-tests were then performed to determine the sFC and dFC differences between HCs and lung cancer patients at t0 and t1, and paired t-tests were used to estimate the sFC and dFC differences between t0 and t1 in the lung cancer patients. Correction was implemented using false discovery rate (FDR) approach and significance threshold was set at p < 0.01. Age, sex and education were used as nuisance covariates to control for the effects of these factors on the results. \n\nIn order to study the temporal properties of dFC patterns, we calculated some dynamic indicators including the mean dwell time (MDT) and the number of transitions (NT). The average time (in windows) spent in a state before transitioning to another state was defined as the MDT. In addition, the NT stands for the number of transitions between states. Group differences tests in the MDT and NT between HCs and lung cancer patients at t0 and t1were checked using a two-sample t-test (P < 0.01, FDR correction). Between-group differences among the lung cancer patients at t0 and t1 were investigated using paired t-tests (P < 0.01, FDR correction). \n\nTo evaluate the correlational relationship of abnormal sFC or dFC and cognitive performance, Pearson correlation analyses were implemented by using SPSS19.0. P less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Partial correlations were calculated after correcting for age, sex and education. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and neuropsychological data \n  \nAll the detailed demographics and a summary of the histological diagnosis and tumor stage are included in Table  . There was no significant difference in age, sex, education level, or MMSE score between the lung cancer patients and the HCs (all p > 0.05).

Compared with those at t0, the lung cancer patients at t1 exhibited significantly decreased dFC between the right DLPFC and the left IFG and between the left DLPFC and right superior orbit frontal gyrus. In state 2, relative to the HCs, the lung cancer patients at t0 showed significantly decreased dFC between the right DLPFC and left insula or MFG and between the left DLPFC and right MCG; at t1, the lung cancer patients showed significantly reduced dFC between the right DLPFC and left thalamus.

Moreover, in state 2, compared with that in the HCs, the decreased dFC of the right DLPFC to the left insula in the lung cancer group at t0 was negatively associated with reduced MoCA scores (r=-0.548,   p   = 0.028) (Fig.  B). \n\n  \n A   Negative correlation between the decreased dFC between the right DLPFC and left SFG and MoCA scores in patients after chemotherapy compared with nonchemotherapy patients (r = -0.520, p = 0.039).

Indeed, research on rest-state sFC changes related to chemotherapy has witnessed exponential growth. In the current study, we found that the regions interacting with the bilateral DLPFC were mainly distributed in the PFC, partial parietal and temporal lobe. The DLPFC, which is the core node of the ECN, is involved in functions including working memory, prospective memory and executive function (Barbey et al.  ; Pochon et al.  ). The PFC and its cortical and subcortical connections play a central role in processing executive functions (Rusnakova et al.  ). In addition, the STG is considered to be a central brain region involved in processing executive functions together with frontal areas that form a cognitive network (Bockova et al.  ). Recent studies have demonstrated that the PFC and STG are impaired in lung cancer patients after chemotherapy (McDonald et al.  ; Simo et al.  ; Wang et al.  ). In breast cancer patients, reduced FC was chiefly seen between the right DLPFC and the right IFG, right MFG, and left STG compared with HCs (Wang et al. ). One month after standard chemotherapy, McDonald et al. (McDonald et al. ) reported that both patients receiving chemotherapy and those not requiring chemotherapy showed decreased activation of the IFG compared to HCs. Our findings are not only consistent with literature reports but are also unique. Our findings support the idea that the cancer disease process itself affects brain functioning (Menning et al.  ); in addition, by means of longitudinal comparison, we confirmed the exact effect of chemotherapy on sFC. \n\nFurthermore, the decreased sFC between the bilateral DLPFC and the left IPL was demonstrated in prechemotherapy lung cancer patients compared with HCs. Sanne et al. (Menning et al.  ) detected that parietal activation decreased in a breast cancer group that was not exposed to any systemic treatment compared to an HC group. Based on previous studies, we speculated that the parietal areas are more susceptible to factors related to stressful events, such as cancer diagnosis and surgery. In contrast, the lung cancer group showed significantly increased sFC between the left DLPFC and right insula after chemotherapy. The insula is believed to be involved in emotion and consciousness. A previous study (Feng et al.  ) reported that patients treated with chemotherapy showed persistent anxiety and depression symptoms over time and that psychological symptom score changes were significantly positively associated with FC changes between the left hippocampus and left insula. We hypothesized that the increased sFC between the left DLPFC and right insula may be a mechanism of self-regulating negative emotion in lung cancer patients. \n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated altered brain sFC patterns in the ECN induced by cancer and chemotherapy. Recent evidence has shown that exploiting the dynamic properties of FC instead of traditional sFC metrics can open up novel thinking for interpreting brain functioning on different timescales (Liegeois et al.  ). Shelli R. Kesler and his colleagues (Kesler et al.  ) demonstrated that functional dynamics were significantly lower in patients with breast cancer than in control participants. In this study, dFC provided additional information that was different from but complementary to the information for sFC. We found significantly decreased dFC variability between the bilateral DLPFC and right SPL and left SFG in lung cancer patients after chemotherapy and significantly reduced dFC between the bilateral DLPFC and left precuneus and ITG when comparing before and after chemotherapy. As mentioned above, the dFC variability changes after chemotherapy were consistent with the sFC changes. \n\nInterestingly, we found some significant brain FC patterns that were related to chemotherapy only when using dFC analysis, while sFC analysis did not reveal any significant correlations. For example, increased dFC variability between the bilateral DLPFC and left precuneus was observed before chemotherapy, and decreased dFC between the right DLPFC and left precuneus was found after chemotherapy. The precuneus, which is part of the posteromedial parietal lobe, is involved in attentive tracking, visuospatial imagination, and spatially guided behaviors (Cavanna and Trimble  ). Simo et al. ( ) revealed that lung cancer patients after chemotherapy showed decreased FC in the left cuneus and precuneus compared to HCs. Additionally, Wang et al. ( ) found increased sFC between the right DLPFC and the right precuneus after chemotherapy. We hypothesize that dFC analysis seems to capture more complex FC changes than sFC, which is also supported by the links that have been drawn between FC and the underlying brain structural connectivity. \n\nIn addition, after clustering analysis, we found that the dFC patterns were completely different under various connectivity states and increased dFC was even found in some states after chemotherapy. For example, in state 3, dFC was significantly increased between the left DLPFC and right MCG. However, we could not discover these FC pattern changes during sFC analysis. Fiorenzato et al. (Fiorenzato et al.  ) also revealed two entirely different connectivity states in Parkinson’s disease patients. The cingulate cortex is usually perceived to be part of the limbic cortex, which lies immediately above the corpus callosum, and the MCG has been termed the cingulate motor area and can be activated by pain and errors made in many tasks (Kolling et al.  ; Rolls  ). Our results demonstrated that dFC analysis could capture new and latent changes in FC and that these changes were possibly derived from the dynamics of connectivity states. Even more importantly, these aforementioned findings provide evidence of increased MCG activity in lung cancer patients and allow us to speculate that this activity is a kind of compensatory mechanism in the brain activated when responding to cancer and chemotherapy. \n\nMoreover, significant between-group differences in the temporal properties of dFC states were recognized in several states. Our results showed that lung cancer patients after chemotherapy tended to have a shortened MDT in certain states and a reduced NT between states, which have not been mentioned in previous studies. However, Fiorenzato et al. (Fiorenzato et al.  ) found that an extended MDT in the segregated state and a reduced NT between states in Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, as we all know that the lung cancer patients are generally treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, which is related to increased cell death and decreased cell division in the central nervous system (Dietrich et al.  ). Therefore, the destruction of neural structures in lung cancer patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy is likely a reason for the decreases in the MDT and NT. Thus, we may reasonably conjecture that the MDT and NT could be reference indexes to assess the effects of chemotherapy on human-brain FC pattern. Hence, more comprehensive forward-looking studies are desperately needed to explore whether the MDT and NT can be appropriate potential biomarkers of cognitive impairment in lung cancer patients. \n\nIn this study, the MoCA scores of lung cancer patients after chemotherapy were dramatically reduced. Concerning the correlations between the FC and MoCA scores, we found no significant correlations between MoCA scores and sFC, while negative correlations between MoCA scores and altered dFC were observed in some brain regions. Static measures of FC, which provide a measure of brain function averaged over several minutes, are oversimplified, and dynamic FC measures that capture temporal changes in brain function on the order of a few seconds have been proposed. Therefore, we judged that dFC could capture more information and was more sensitive for assessing brain function and cognitive defects in lung cancer patients after chemotherapy than sFC. \n\nThere were a few limitations in this study. First, the relatively small sample size might reduce the generalizability of our results to some extent. Second, although the present study employed a longitudinal experimental design, follow-up data were collected only for patients in the lung cancer group and not for healthy controls. Previous studies (Feng et al.  ; Pergolizzi et al.  ) have provided evidence that cancer patients after chemotherapy exhibit FC changes during short-term follow-up (3–6 months) and have no significant difference in healthy controls. Nevertheless, all enrolled subjects should be strictly followed in subsequent longitudinal studies. Finally, we selected the bilateral DLPFC as the seed regions to investigate the sFC and dFC patterns in the ECN after chemotherapy and explore the correlational relationships with MoCA scores. The MoCA is a brief cognitive screening tool that is not very sensitive to certain domains, such as executive functions and memory, which have been exposed to be damaged after chemotherapy in previous studies. Thus, a more sophisticated and niche-targeted cognitive evaluation should be performed in future studies. \n\nIn conclusion, this is the first study to explore the sFC and dFC variations within the ECN and the relationships between the aberrant FC and cognitive decline in lung cancer patients before and after chemotherapy. Despite the limitations of the present study, our results revealed that using a dynamic connectivity analysis was more effective and sensitive for linking brain FC patterns and chemotherapy than methods that assume static brain states. The most important implication from our study is to bring awareness to cancer clinicians so they can provide information on expected CRCI to cancer patients. Moreover, several treatments are underway to help combat the symptoms of chemobrain. We concluded that the temporal dynamics of FC could be a potential biomarker to detect cognitive alterations in lung cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and provide a solid evidence for multidisciplinary rehabilitation prevention and treatment of chemobrain. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"e58d43ff59f1ae351229ce264c97a1f5"},

We further validated the dynamic FC values computed with SSTD window-sizes with both a classification analysis using fMRI data with a low sampling rate and a regression analysis using fMRI data with a high sampling rate. Specifically, we achieved both a higher classification accuracy in predicting cognitive impairment status in fighters and a larger explained behavioral variance in healthy young adults when using dynamic FC matrices computed with SSTD window-sizes as features, as compared to using dynamic FC matrices computed with the conventional fixed window-sizes. Overall, our study computed and validated SSTD window-sizes in the sliding-window method for dynamic FC analysis. Our results demonstrate that dynamic FC matrices computed with SSTD window-sizes can capture more temporal dynamic information related to behavior and cognitive function. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nBrain functional connectivity (FC) has been widely studied using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and is most commonly assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient among distributed brain regions ( ). Many studies have identified a set of statistically interdependent regions where the blood-oxygenated-level-dependent (BOLD) signals are temporally correlated in the absence of an explicit task ( ;  ;  ;  ). Investigating resting-state FC has provided fundamental insight into basic neural function and disease conditions ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nMore recently, studies have demonstrated that instead of being temporally static, FC can change periodically over time during an fMRI scan ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Dynamic FC analysis has been proposed to investigate and understand these periodic temporal changes (see  ;  ;   for reviews). Altered dynamic FC have been reported in various neurological disorders such as schizophrenia ( ), Alzheimer’s disease ( ), Parkinson’s disease ( ), major depression disorders ( ), and autism ( ). All of these findings demonstrate the pathophysiologic relevance of dynamic FC across multiple diseased populations, and thus investigating dynamic FC will lead to better understanding of these conditions. \n\nMany methods have been proposed for dynamic FC analysis, such as the sliding-window method ( ;  ), multivariate volatility models ( ), temporal independent component analysis (ICA) ( ;  ), the quasi-periodic pattern method ( ;  ), the hidden Markov model ( ), and co-activation pattern (CAP) analysis ( ). The sliding-window method captures the FC in a certain time window by calculating pairwise correlation or covariance, then shifts to the next time window and repeats the same procedure until the last fMRI volume. Dynamic FC is then characterized by the windowed covariance or correlation matrices. Multivariate volatility models, such as exponentially weighted moving average and dynamic conditional correlation methods, are parametric models of the conditional correlation between time courses which refine the concept of sliding-window. Temporal ICA decomposes each subject’s fMRI time series into temporally independent components, defined as distinct functional modes. The quasi-periodic pattern method evaluates the spatiotemporal dynamics of the BOLD signals to identify a common whole-brain pattern that occurs periodically during an fMRI scan. The Hidden Markov model decodes connectivity dynamics into a temporal sequence of hidden network “states” for each subject. The CAP analysis examines the dynamics of a specific resting-state network and tracks the variations of FC within each individual time frame. \n\nAmong all these methods, the sliding-window method is one of the most widely applied techniques in dynamic FC analysis due to its relative simplicity, and it has been successfully applied to reveal macro-scale spatiotemporal fluctuation of the brain in multiple diseased populations ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, a few concerns remain unaddressed. \n\nThe first concern is the choice of window-size. Currently, there is no consensus on the optimum length of the window used in this method. Ideally, the window-size should be both small enough to capture temporal transients and large enough to produce stable and statistically powerful results ( ).   recommend choosing a window-size that exceeds the longest wavelength in the BOLD signal to avoid spurious connectivity fluctuations (~100s), which is termed the rule-of-thumb in window-size selection.   later validate this rule-of-thumb choice but also demonstrate that, theoretically, the dynamic FC can be stably detected with a much shorter window (~40s). The fundamental nature of choices for these fixed window lengths limits the dynamic FC analysis to the fluctuations in the frequency range below the window period, irrespective of the true frequency content of the data ( ). In this case, a time-dependent window-size, based on the true frequency content of the fMRI time series, could more accurately capture the time-varying FC changes in the data and is necessary to the sliding-window method. Furthermore, adaptive window-sizes have already been successfully applied in other fields, including frequent item sets mining in data stream ( ;  ) and estimation of data center source utilization ( ). \n\nAnother concern is how to validate the observed dynamic FC as true temporal variations instead of confounding noises. Multiple null models have been proposed to test the statistical significance of the dynamic FC variations ( ;  ). However, heterogeneous test results could be obtained from choosing different methods to produce surrogates and applying different test-statistics ( ). Without a known ground truth, this procedure is data dependent and time-consuming. In this case, indirect validation from investigating the useful information carried by dynamic FC could be more appropriate to determine the significance of dynamic FC analysis. Previous studies have utilized dynamic FC information as features in classifying normal subjects from diseased populations ( ;  ) and predict cognitive function at the individual level ( ;  ). Therefore, a reliable classification result with dynamic FC matrices as features suggests dynamic FC matrices capture true temporal variations that carry disease-relevant information. Furthermore, multiple studies have revealed associations between static FC matrices and behavioral assessments such as age ( ), gender ( ), intelligence ( ), cognition and emotions ( ), which demonstrate the behavioral and clinical relevance of static FC matrices. However, the associations between dynamic FC matrices computed from the sliding-window method and behavioral assessments have not been investigated yet and remain a potential tool for validating the observed dynamic FC as a true temporal variation that carries behavioral-relevant information. \n\nTaken together, in this study, we first computed single-scale time-dependent (SSTD) window-sizes at every time point in the sliding-window approach using empirical mode decomposition (EMD). With SSTD window-sizes we refer to exactly   one   window-size per time point instead of multiple window-sizes per time point (as in   multi-scale   window-sizes). EMD is a data-adaptive analysis method for studying the naturally occurring frequency bands in time series, which can be used for non-stationary signals and allows the decomposition of time series into nearly orthogonal modes spanning narrow frequency bands ( ). Decomposed signals from EMD track local periodic changes of non-stationary time series and time-dependent window-sizes can be determined at each time point. Multi-scale time-dependent window-sizes based on EMD were first proposed in  , where multiple window-sizes were computed for a single time point. Multi-scale time--dependent window-sizes have been successfully applied in dynamic analysis of temperature changes and dissolved oxygen time series ( ). However, correlation values computed from multiple window-sizes at a single time point between two time series are difficult to interpret in terms of dynamic FC. In this case, our group first used a weighted average to combine these multi-scale window-sizes in  . In this study, we further improved this method to produce more stable results and termed it SSTD window-sizes. We also demonstrated the reliability of SSTD window-sizes in capturing frequency information at every time-point using simulated time series. \n\nWe next computed the standard deviation matrices over all slided windows with SSTD window-sizes to quantify the dynamic FC. We validated dynamic FC matrices computed from SSTD window-sizes with both a regression analysis using   Human Connectome Project   (HCP) ( ) data with a high sampling rate and a classification framework using   Professional Fighters Brain Health Study   (PFBHS) ( ) data with a conventional sampling rate. Dynamic FC matrices computed with SSTD window-sizes were compared with those computed with conventional fixed window-sizes in both analyses. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Computation of SSTD window-sizes \n  \n#### EMD decomposition \n  \nEMD uses a sifting algorithm to decompose the original multicomponent time series into nearly orthogonal modes spanning narrow frequency bands ( ), which are named intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Let   denote the resting-state time series from a single voxel and   N   is the total number of time points. To avoid unstable EMD decomposition results at the starting and ending point of   y  (  t  ), a new time series   is first created by:\n \nwhere flip(  y  (  t  )) reverses the order of the time points in   y  (  t  ).   is then intensity normalized and decomposed into   K   IMFs using the sifting algorithm ( ):\n \nwhere   c  (  t  ) is the   i  th IMF and   r  (  t  ) is the residual function. The number of IMFs (  K  ) here is determined from the data itself during the sifting algorithm. IMFs obtained from EMD are naturally oscillating functions and with frequency contents in a descending order, i.e.   c  (  t  ) contains the highest frequency component and   c  (  t  ) contains the lowest. The residual   r  (  t  ) contains only the trend-level frequency component. \n\n\n#### Instantaneous period and average energy \n  \nThe instantaneous period is computed only for the center part of each IMF   c  (  t  ), which corresponds to the time points in the original signal. For each IMF, the instantaneous frequency   f  (  t  ) is first computed using the Hilbert Transform by extending   c  (  t  ) into the complex domain ( ;  ;  ). The instantaneous period   p  (  t  ) is then defined as  . Furthermore, since   has been intensity normalized, the energy of each IMF is defined as  . In this case, the instantaneous periods   p  (  t  ) capture the local non-stationarity of the original signal, and the average energy densities   E   summarize the energy contributions of each IMF to the original signal. \n\n\n#### SSTD window-sizes of two fMRI time series y  (t) and y (t) \n  \nFollowing the above steps, we have computed   and   to denote the instantaneous period at time   t   for IMFs   corresponding to   y   (  t  ) and   corresponding to   y   (  t  ), respectively. We also have computed   and   for the average energy corresponding to each   and  . We then define a weighted instantaneous period for each   y   (  t  ), (  m   = 1, 2) as\n \n\nSSTD window-size of   y  (  t  ) and   y  (  t  ) is finally defined as:\n \n\nFurthermore, for noisy time series with limited durations, IMFs with low frequencies may not be sufficiently covered by the length of time series, and EMD may lead to non-orthogonal components at very low frequencies. These IMFs usually contain longer instantaneous period but lower energy. Therefore, in computing the weighted instantaneous period for each   y  (  t  ), (  m   = 1, 2) using  , IMFs with energy less than of the total energy have been excluded. \n\n\n\n### Validation with simulation \n  \nWe demonstrate through simulation that SSTD window-sizes can represent the true period (frequency) information at every time point. To this end, we considered two pure sinusoidal signals. The first signal was a cosine wave with frequency   f   suddenly switching to   f   at a certain time point:\n \nwhere   TR   was the repetition time (inverse of the sampling rate) and   N   was the total number of time points. The other signal was a simple cosine wave with a fixed frequency   f  :\n \n\nIn our simulation, we chose   f   = 0.02 Hz,   f   = 0.05 Hz and   f   = 0.04 Hz, respectively. The total duration of time series was set to 300s (5mins), and the frequency shift of   y   happened at t = 200s. We chose the   TR   to be 0.72s and 2.8s, respectively, to mimic the two real fMRI data used in this study (described in more details in   and  ).   N   was set to be   in each case. SSTD window-sizes were determined as described in  . Dynamic FC values between   y   and   y   were computed using the sliding-window approach with SSTD window-sizes and fixed window-sizes of 30s, 60s and 100s. \n\n\n### Validation with classification analysis using fMRI data with low sampling rate \n  \n#### Subjects \n  \n65 cognitively non-impaired fighters and 68 cognitively impaired fighters from the   PFBHS   ( ) were included in our study. Their cognitive impairment status was predefined based on fighters’ performance of the Finger Tapping test and Symbol Digit Coding test from the CNS Vital Signs tests ( ). Cognitively non-impaired and impaired fighters were matched for age, gender, years of education, and fighting exposures (number of fights, years of fighting and knock-out counts). Detailed demographics are listed in  . \n\nMRI data were collected for all subjects on a 3T Siemens Verio scanner with a 32-channel head coil. Resting-state fMRI data were collected with following parameters: TR = 2.8s, TE = 28 ms, in-plane resolution 2mm × 2mm, slice thickness 4 mm, 30 axial slices and 137 time frames (6mins and 24s). In addition, a high resolution T1-weighted structural image was acquired using a standard 3D MPRAGE sequence. \n\n\n#### Preprocessing \n  \nEach T1-weighted image was input into the FreeSurfer 6.0 processing pipeline ( ) to generate a subject-specific cortical and subcortical parcellation. 66 cortical labels from Desikan-Killiany atlas ( ), and 12 sub-cortical labels were defined as regions of interest (ROIs). This anatomical labeling was wrapped to each subject’s fMRI space using a 12-parameters affine transform in Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) software ( ). \n\nThe first 4 time frames (~12s) of fMRI data were removed to allow the MR signal to achieve T1 equilibrium. Remaining time frames were slice-timing corrected and realigned to the mean echo-planar image in SPM12 ( ). FMRI data were further spatially smoothed using a 6 mm 3D-Gaussian filter in the subject fMRI space and high-pass filtered with a cosine filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.008 Hz. Nuisance regression was performed to further denoise the fMRI data, using six head motion parameters and CompCor generated white-matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signals ( ). Finally, all voxel time courses were variance normalized. \n\n\n#### Dynamic FC estimation \n  \nAverage time series of each ROI were obtained in the subject’s fMRI space. Static FC were estimated by computing the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between time series from each ROI pair. Dynamic FC were estimated using the sliding-window method with both SSTD window-sizes and multiple conventional fixed window-sizes. Pearson’s correlation between time series from all ROI pairs were computed within the defined window and the window was slided over 1 TR (2.8s). The standard deviation of Pearson’s correlations over all windows were defined as the dynamic FC values for all pairs of ROIs and formed the dynamic FC matrices. This dynamic FC matrices then were used to represent whole-brain temporal dynamics. \n\n\n#### Classification framework \n  \nBoth static and dynamic FC were used as features to classify cognitive impairment status of fighters. Classification framework included an automated feature selection step and a radial basis functional classifier step (see  , for details). A ten-fold cross-validation was used to determine the classification accuracy. The classification process was repeated 100 times to rule out the potential division bias in the ten-fold division. Classification accuracy, sensitivity (correctly classified impaired fighters), specificity (correctly classified nonimpaired fighters), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for all 100 iterations were used to evaluate the classifier performance. \n\n\n\n### Validation with regression analysis using fMRI data with a high sampling rate \n  \n#### Subjects \n  \nThe same subjects used in our previous study ( ) were used in this study. Briefly, 88 male subjects from   HCP   1200 Subject Release ( ;  ), who were 26 to 30 years old and completed both resting-state fMRI and T1-weighted structural scans, were included. Detailed demographic information is listed in  . \n\nResting-state fMRI data were acquired on 3T Siemens scanners using a Gradient-echo EPI sequence with the following parameters: multiband factor = 8, TR = 0.72s, TE = 33.1 ms, 2.0 mm isotropic voxels, 72 axial slices and 1200 time points (14mins and 24s). A high resolution T1-weighted structural image was acquired using a 3D MPRAGE sequence. \n\n\n#### Behavioral measurements \n  \n56 behavioral measurements were used to evaluate if the dynamic FC matrices computed with the proposed optimum window-size can better explain the behavioral variance than the dynamic FC matrices estimated with conventional fixed window-sizes. Initially, 64 behavioral measurements covering cognitive, social, emotion, personality traits, tobacco consumption, drug consumption, rule breaking, antisocial behavior, pain intensity, and externalization were included. Out of these 64 behavioral measurements, 8 were excluded from our analysis based on the following two criteria: 1) more than 5% of subjects did not have valid measurements; 2) the maximal value was more than 100 times the mean value, which suggested extreme outliers. Details of these 56 behavioral variables are listed in  . \n\n\n#### Preprocessing \n  \nThe minimally preprocessed resting-state fMRI data (in the standard MNI space) were downloaded from the HCP website ( ) and were treated as the raw fMRI data in our analysis. A more detailed description of HCP minimal preprocessing steps can be found in  . Additionally, the first 15 vol (~11s) of fMRI data were discarded to avoid data with an unsaturated T1 signal, and the same nuisance regressors as used for the   PFBHS   data were used to further denoise the   HCP   data. \n\n\n#### Dynamic FC estimation \n  \nAverage time series from 112 regions of the automated anatomical labeling atlas ( ) were obtained. Static and dynamic FC matrices were estimated the same way as for the   PFBHS   data. Specifically, both SSTD window-sizes and multiple conventional fixed windows were used in the sliding-window approach. The window was slided over 4 time points (2.88s) due to the fast sampling rate. \n\n\n#### Regression analysis \n  \nStatic and dynamic FC matrices were rearranged as a single vector for each subject, and these vectors for all subjects were arranged in a matrix. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on the matrix to reduce data dimension and only those components that explain more than 1% of the variance were retained. Linear regression was applied for each behavioral measurement separately with PCA components as independent variables and the behavioral measure as the dependent variable. The coefficient of determination, namely R-squared, was used to measure the proportion of behavioral variance explained by the FC matrix ( ). Subjects’ age and handedness were used as covariates and regressed out from behavioral measurements prior to PCA. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Validation with simulation \n  \nSimulated signals with TR = 0.72s and 2.8s give similar results, and therefore we include simulation results with TR = 0.72s here in  . The simulation results with TR = 2.8s is included in  . Simulated signals   y   and   y   are plotted in  . Corresponding frequency spectrums are shown in  . For time points before   t   = 200s,   y   is dominated by frequency   f   = 0.02 Hz and   y   is dominated by frequency   f   = 0.04 Hz, and therefore the corresponding periods of   y   is 50s (~70 TR) and of   y   is 25s (~35 TR) in this time segment. For time points after   t   = 200s,   y   is dominated by frequency   f   = 0.05 Hz and   y   is dominated by frequency   f   = 0.04 Hz, and therefore the corresponding periods of   y   is 20s (~28 TR) and of   y   is 25s (~35 TR) in this time segment. As shown by the solid blue (  y  ) and red lines (  y  ) in  , the instantaneous periods computed from our method capture exactly these periods at almost all time points for both signals. The SSTD window-sizes are then set to be the larger period of the two signals, as shown by the dashed green lines in  . Multiple fixed window-sizes are also shown as dashed yellow, purple and light blue lines in   for references.   plots dynamic FC values computed from the sliding-window approach with SSTD window-sizes (solid green line) and multiple fixed window-sizes (dashed yellow, purple and light blue lines). As shown by the solid green line, using SSTD window-sizes in the sliding-window approach captures both the stable and small correlation between two signals at time points before   t   = 200s, and large variations of correlations between two signals at time points after   t   = 200s. \n\n\n### Validation with classification analysis \n  \n#### Average SSTD window-sizes \n  \nAverage SSTD window-sizes computed from our method are 34.66s±2.29s for cognitively nonimpaired fighters and 34.20s± 2.29s for cognitively impaired fighters ( ). Histograms of average SSTD window-sizes for each subject are also shown in  . Thus, the main fixed window-size for comparison is chosen to be 35s (~12 TR). We further compute the dynamic FC matrices with fixed window-sizes of 60s (~21 TR) and 90s (~32 TR) as suggested in   for comprehensive comparisons. \n\n\n#### Classification results \n  \n shows the classifier performance of the   PFBHS   data, with static FC (sFC, red), static and dynamic FC with fixed window-size of 35s (sFC&dFC-35s, green), and static and dynamic FC with SSTD window-sized (sFC&dFC-SSTD, purple) as features, respectively. Boxplots of the area under the ROC curve (A), accuracy (B), sensitivity (C), and specificity (D) are shown for 100 iterations. As shown in  , adding temporal dynamics information significantly improves the classifier performance, as compared to using static FC information alone (green and purple boxes vs. red box). Using dynamic FC matrices computed with SSTD window-sizes further significantly improves the classifier performance, as compared to using dynamic FC matrices computed from the comparable fixed window-size (p = 1.52 × 10 , purple box vs. green box). \n\n further plots areas under the ROC curves for classifications using static FC and dynamic FC with 35s (sFC&dFC-35s), 60s (sFC&dFC-60s), 90s (sFC&dFC-90s), and SSTD windows (sFC&dFC-SSTD) as features separately.   lists p-values of statistical comparisons (two-sample   t  -test) between classification results using different features. As shown in   and  , using sFC&dFC-SSTD as features significantly outperforms sFC&dFC-35s (p = 1.52 × 10 ), sFC&dFC-60s (p = 1.33 × 10 ), and sFC&dFC-90s (p = 3.04 × 10 ) in classifying cognitive impairment status in fighters. \n\n\n\n### Validation with regression analysis \n  \nAs listed in  , the average SSTD window-sizes computed from the proposed method for   HCP   data is 32.73 ± 3.52s. Histograms of average SSTD window-sizes for each subject are also shown in  . In this case, the main fixed window-size for comparison is chosen to be 32.4s (~45 TR). Furthermore, since   HCP   data are acquired with a fast sampling rate, we can use a smaller window-size but still keep enough time points to compute the windowed FC matrix. Therefore, the dynamic FC matrices computed using the sliding-window approach with fixed window-sizes of 21s (~30 TR) and 65s (~90 TR) are further used for comprehensive comparisons. \n\n plots the explained behavioral variance of   HCP   data using sFC, sFC&dFC-32s, and sFC&dFC-SSTD as features. As shown in  , significant larger variance is explained by both static and dynamic FC matrices than by static FC matrices alone (green and purple boxes vs. red box). Using dynamic FC matrices computed with SSTD window-sizes further increases the explained behavioral variance by 19.7% (purple box vs. green box) on average.   further compares the performance of SSTD window-sizes with multiple fixed window-sizes in the regression analysis. As shown by the purple box, larger behavioral variances can be explained more by the dynamic FC matrices computed with SSTD window-sizes than by multiple fixed window-sizes (green boxes). Statistical significance levels (two-sample   t  -test) are listed in  . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we computed SSTD window-sizes in the sliding-window method for dynamic FC analysis. SSTD window-sizes of two time series were based on their frequency contents and were computed from the instantaneous period and average energy of each IMF obtained from the EMD method. Using simulated time series, we first demonstrated that SSTD window-sizes can capture the time-dependent frequency information in the time series. The optimum performances of dynamic FC matrices computed with SSTD window-sizes were further validated through both a classification analysis using the   PFBHS   data with a low sampling rate and a regression analysis using the   HCP   data with a high sampling rate. Specifically, both a higher classification accuracy in predicting cognitive impairment status in fighters and a larger explained behavioral variance in healthy young adults were achieved using dynamic FC matrices computed with SSTD window-sizes as features, as compared to using dynamic FC matrices computed with several conventional fixed window-sizes. \n\n### SSTD window-sizes are data-driven, time-dependent, and can capture the frequency content in simulated time series \n  \nSSTD window-sizes are based on the frequency content of the time series itself, and thus are purely data-driven. The frequency content of the time series is represented by the instantaneous period at every time point and therefore SSTD window-sizes are time-dependent. Simulated time series with known frequency contents are used to demonstrate that time-dependent and data-driven window-sizes can accurately capture the frequency information of the time series. \n\nThe simulated time-series are basic oscillatory and stationary functions with local means equal to zero, therefore the Hilbert Transform is well defined and produces meaningful non-negative instantaneous frequencies for these two time series ( ). As shown in  , in our simulation, a sudden frequency switch from   f   = 0.02 Hz to   f   = 0.05 Hz happens at   t   = 200s for signal   y   ( ), and the frequency for signal   y   stays at   f   = 0.025 Hz for the entire time series. The lowest frequency contained in simulated signals is therefore 0.02 Hz. According to the rule-of-thumb criteria ( ), the window-size used in the sliding-window approach should be larger than  . However, dynamic FC values computed with choices following this rule miss the large periodic temporal variations after   t   = 200s and lead to a larger transition period (dashed light blue and purple lines in  ). Furthermore, dynamic FC values computed with a relatively small window are able to capture the large temporal variations after   t   = 200s, but create unstable and unreal large temporal variations before   t   = 200s (dashed yellow line in  ). In some cases, dynamic FC values computed with a small window-size may even pass the statistical significance test, but the strong variability is still not real and is mainly the reason for the lack of degree of freedom in the calculation ( ). \n\nSSTD window-sizes, however, automatically capture the frequency switch in our simulation by outputting a window-size of 50s before   t   = 200s and another window-size of 25s after   t   = 200s (dashed green line in  ). This result demonstrates that SSTD window-sizes are time-dependent and capture the exact frequency information of the time-series. Furthermore, no prior information is required to calculate SSTD window-sizes and thus the procedure is purely data-driven. Dynamic FC values computed from SSTD window-sizes also give optimum performance, as they not only capture both large temporal variations in functional correlation between   y   and   y   after   t   = 200s but also correctly identify small correlation between   y   and   y   before   t   = 200s (solid green line in  ). \n\nThe simulation with TR = 2.8s ( ) gives similar results as the simulation with TR = 0.72s ( ), but the less time points of TR = 2.8s results in less smoothed curves in  . Overall, as shown in   and  , our simulation results demonstrate that SSTD window-sizes can capture frequency changes in time series. \n\n\n### SSTD window-sizes capture more meaningful temporal dynamics information of fMRI time series \n  \nFunctional MRI time series are usually non-stationary. Therefore, in our method, we first decompose the original time series into multiple IMFs, which represent different scales of the original time series and form the adaptive and oscillating basis of the data ( ;  ;  ). An IMF is defined as a basic oscillatory function with an extreme value followed by a zero-crossing ( ). Thus, the Hilbert Transform is well defined for an IMF ( ). Furthermore, since the fMRI time series is first intensity normalized in our study and EMD is essentially a sifting algorithm that estimates an IMF and subtracts it successively ( ), the average energy of each IMF represents weight and contribution of each IMF to the original signal in terms of intensity. Therefore, at each time point, we then use the average of instantaneous periods of all IMFs weighted by the corresponding energy ( ) to represent the period information of the original fMRI time series. We further demonstrate that the dynamic FC matrices computed using this energy-weighted period measurement can capture more cognitively and behaviorally meaningful information. \n\n#### Both static and dynamic FC matrices contain disease and cognitive relevant information \n  \nPrevious studies have demonstrated that FC matrices, both static and dynamic, can be used as feature sets to classify normal subjects from subjects with a cognitive disorder or disease. For example, using static FC matrices alone,   achieved an accuracy of 92.3% in classifying schizophrenia patients from normal subjects. However, the small sample size (~50 in total) in   limited its generalization.   used a much larger sample size (273) and demonstrated that using both static and dynamic FC as features, an accuracy level of 89% was achieved in classifying schizophrenia patients, bipolar patients, and normal subjects, which was significantly higher than using static FC matrices as features alone (59%). These studies have demonstrated that both static and dynamic FC contain disorder-related information. Furthermore, using static FC derived measurements, multiple studies have shown that high accuracy can be achieved in classifying normal subjects, subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjects with Alzheimer’s disease ( ;  ;  ;  ). These studies further suggest that FC matrices contain cognitively meaningful information, as MCI and AD patients usually show significant loss in cognition (see  , for a review). \n\n\n#### Both static and dynamic FC matrices contain behavioral meaningful information \n  \nDisease is not the only factor driving the structure involved in strength and flexibility of brain FC. Multiple studies have demonstrated that a battery of personal behaviors are encoded in functional brain connections as well, including intelligence ( ;  ), personality, socialization, cognition and emotions ( ;  ;  ). Furthermore,   have shown that fluid intelligence is significantly correlated with the predicted score based on the strength of dynamic FC matrices, and the observed cognitive flexibility and executive inhibition are significantly correlated with the predicted scores based on the variability of dynamic FC matrices. Therefore, all of these studies suggest that FC matrices contain behaviorally meaningful information. \n\n\n#### Dynamic FC matrices computed with SSTD window-sizes capture cognitively and behaviorally meaningful information \n  \nAs shown by  –  and   and  , better classification performances and higher explained behavioral variances are achieved when using dynamic FC matrices computed with SSTD window-sizes as features in the classification and regression analysis separately, as compared to using dynamic FC matrices computed with conventional fixed window-sizes. The frequency information of a non-stationary fMRI signal remains unstable and, therefore, a fixed window-size that is optimal for one time segment may not be suitable for other time segments. SSTD window-sizes, in contrast, are data-driven and time-dependent, allowing these subtle variations of the temporal dynamics to be captured. \n\n\n\n### Technical perspectives \n  \n#### Improvements over previous methods \n  \nAs we introduced above, SSTD window-sizes are based on the multi-scale time-dependent intrinsic correlation method that was first proposed by  , where multiple window-sizes were computed for a single time point. Specifically, at a single time point, one window-size was determined for each IMF and a 2D heat plot was generated to represent the multi-scale intrinsic correlations between two time series ( ). This method captures the time-dependent frequency information in the original time series but is difficult to interpret for BOLD signals in terms of FCs. \n\nIn  , our group proposed a weighted average to combine these multiple window-sizes at each time point in the sliding-window dynamic FC analysis. It has been observed that the Hilbert Transform produces unstable results at cutting time points, and therefore extreme and oscillated window-sizes were obtained for the starting and ending time points in  , leading to an average window-sizes of 97.75s ± 41.36s ( ). In the current study, we first improved the method to compute SSTD window-sizes by creating longer time series to ensure the continuity of the starting and ending time points and to avoid unstable and extreme results. In addition, from the method perspective, the number of IMFs in   was a fixed and predefined parameter. In the current method, the number of IMFs is determined from the data itself, and therefore the entire process in computing SSTD window-sizes is data-driven without any predefined parameters. As a result, average SSTD window-sizes computed for both data in the current study is around 34s, which is closer to values reported in  . Furthermore, from a validation perspective, the combined window-size in   was only validated for BOLD signals with a TR of 2.4s using the dynamic states routine following  , where the number of dynamic states was another tuning parameter which may affect the results (discussed in more detail in the next section). In the current study, we validate SSTD window-sizes using fMRI data with TR = 2.8 and 0.72s respectively, which demonstrates the optimum performance of SSTD window-sizes over fixed window-sizes in the sliding-window analysis for BOLD signals with both low and high sampling rates. Finally, the current study quantifies dynamic FC matrices using the standard deviation of each FC over all slided windows, which is computed without any tuning parameters and is a more direct measure to compare performances between different window-sizes, as compared to the dynamic states routine. \n\n\n#### Methods to estimate instantaneous frequency \n  \nIn computing SSTD window-sizes, we used EMD combined with the Hilbert transform to estimate the instantaneous frequency of BOLD signals, which is the Hilbert Huang Transform ( ). Analytically, the instantaneous frequency of a time signal is defined as the derivative of the phase ( ). For a real signal, the most common method to compute its phase is to build a complex signal with the original signal as the real part and the Hilbert Transform of the original signal as the imaginary part ( ). However, this method works only for the signal with a narrow frequency range, which is not the case for multicomponent BOLD signals. The Hilbert Huang transform works for the BOLD signals by applying EMD to decompose the original signal into IMFs, where each IMF represents a simple oscillatory mode within a limited frequency band that meets the pre-request of the analytical method. Instead of EMD, narrow-band pass filters could also be applied to decompose the original BOLD signals into multiple time-series with limited frequency bands that are suitable for the Hilbert transform. \n\n\n#### Other signal decomposition methods \n  \nAs we stated above, EMD decomposes original BOLD signals into multiple IMFs with different frequency components. Other methods also can be applied to represent BOLD signals in terms of multiple frequency components, such as the Fourier transform and the Wavelet transform ( ). Both Fourier and Wavelet transforms require a predefined fixed basis function and give a bounded time-frequency relationship, which work well for time series with known underlying physical processes. However, underlying process of BOLD signals are usually difficult to define. On the other hand, EMD requires no a priori defined basis functions and uses data itself to determine the underlying frequency information. Therefore, in our study, we used EMD, instead of Fourier or wavelet transform, to decompose BOLD signals. \n\n\n#### Using standard deviation to quantify temporal dynamics over all slided windows \n  \nFollowing computing windowed FC matrices, most studies perform a clustering analysis to identify different brain-states based on spatial similarities among all windowed FC matrices, and used the clustered brain-states to quantify temporal dynamics ( ;  ;  ). We do not use the classified brain states, mainly because, in this method, the number of brain-states is another parameter to be pre-determined. Functional connections within each brain-state, time points spent in each brain-state and frequency of brain-state transitions significantly depend on this predefined number. Furthermore, in a classification framework with dynamic FC as input features similar to the framework used in our study, the number of features increases linearly with the pre-defined number of brain-states, which could easily exceed the number of subjects and thus make it difficult for classification framework to produce meaningful results. In addition,   have demonstrated that the fluctuation of dynamic FC (i.e. its variance) has a strong potential to provide individual-specific differences. Finally,   compute dynamic FC strength, stability, and variability to characterize temporal dynamics over all slided windows and show that these measurements could successfully identify individuals with high accuracy and reliably predict higher individual cognitive performance. In our study, similar ideas are applied, and the temporal dynamics of FC between an ROI pair is quantified by the standard deviation of this connection over all slided windows. \n\n\n#### Using both static FC and dynamic FC matrices as dynamic FC features in classification and regression analysis \n  \nIn our study, we always kept both static and dynamic FC matrices as dynamic features in both classification and regression analysis.   defined the average of FC matrices over all slided windows as dynamic FC mean strength and considered it as one of the dynamic characteristic measurements. The same measurement was computed in our study for both   PFBHS   data and   HCP   data. High spatial similarities between the static FC matrix and dynamic FC mean strength matrix were observed for both data ( ). Therefore, in our study, a static FC matrix was used to represent the dynamic FC mean strength, and was used together with the standard deviation matrix as features for both classification and regression analysis. \n\n\n#### Using two datasets to validate SSTD window-sizes \n  \nWe used two fMRI data to validate SSTD window-sizes in this study, one with a conventional sampling rate (TR = 2.8s,   PFBHS   data) and a total duration of 6mins and 20s; and the other one with a faster sampling rate (TR = 0.72s,   HCP   data) and a total duration of 14mins and 20s. For fMRI data with a low sampling rate, temporal changes may be missed due to under-sampling of the fMRI signal, whereas for fMRI data with a high sampling rate, the captured temporal changes may be sensitive to spurious noises. Therefore, we have validated SSTD window-sizes in both cases in the current study. The larger explained behavioral variance and higher classification accuracy when using SSTD window-sizes suggest that SSTD window-sizes were able to capture temporal dynamics in fMRI data with both low and high sampling rates. \n\n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nOne limitation of the SSTD window-sizes method is that the performance may deteriorate as the noise level in BOLD signals increases. The first step of the SSTD window-sizes method is to decompose BOLD signals into IMFs using the EMD method. Despite the capability of dealing with nonlinear and non-stationary data, EMD still cannot resolve the signal from the noise in complicated cases, especially when the noise has the same time scale as the signal ( ). Future performance comparisons of the SSTD window-sizes method on BOLD signals with different de-noising strategies are needed to test and clarify the noise effects of the SSTD window-sizes method. \n\nFurthermore, EMD is currently run on the entire concatenated time series; therefore, the number of IMFs is the same for all time points and remains static. For longer fMRI time series, the number of IMFs may also vary at different time points. One way to achieve a dynamic number of IMFs is to run EMD separately on each time series segment, which will increase the computational cost and is also less stable with shorter segments. After the EMD step, instantaneous period at every time point and average energy across all time points are used to compute the SSTD window-sizes in the current method. In this case, while the period is dynamically calculated at every time point, the energy is still assumed to be static across all time points. Static assumptions on both the energy and the number of IMFs may not be the most appropriate for a dynamic analysis. Future efforts towards computing an accurate time-dependent energy measure and determining dynamic number of IMFs at each time point, if possible, may further improve the performance of SSTD window-sizes. However, whether these extra dynamics reflect the intrinsic temporal variations of human brain function or just random noises also require further evaluations. \n\nAnother limitation of the current study is our use of simple sinusoidal signals with frequency shifts in our simulation to demonstrate that SSTD window-sizes capture the exact period (frequency) information at every time point (  and  ). Real fMRI signals are much more complicated than sinusoidal signals due to mixed frequency contents, physiological and electronic noise sources. We refrained from using more elaborate simulations with mixed frequency content because the ground-truth of the signal becomes difficult, if not impossible, to define. Nevertheless, future efforts toward generating simulated signals that both have known frequency contents and represent signal distributions mimicking more real fMRI data may provide alternatives to validate SSTD window-sizes. In addition, previous studies have suggested that the variance of dynamic FC values derived from sliding-window approach with fixed window-sizes are less reliable than the dynamic conditional correlation derived measures ( ). Future efforts towards the reproducibility analysis of sliding-window approach with SSTD window-sizes and the comparisons with other dynamic FC analysis methods are required to further validate our method. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nSingle-scale time-dependent window-sizes (SSTD) have been computed in the sliding-window method for dynamic FC analysis. SSTD window-sizes are based on the frequency contents of the time series and computed with EMD and a spectral analysis using the Hilbert Huang Transform. Simulation has demonstrated that SSTD window-sizes are data-driven, time-dependent and capture the exact frequency content in the time series. Using dynamic FC matrices computed with SSTD window-sizes as features, both a higher classification accuracy between cognitively impaired and nonimpaired fighters and a larger explained behavioral variance in normal healthy adults are achieved, as compared to using dynamic FC computed with multiple conventional fixed window-sizes as features. Both classification and regression results have demonstrated that SSTD window-sizes are able to capture cognitive-function-related and behaviorally meaningful temporal dynamics information in resting-state fMRI data. MATLAB codes used to compute SSTD window-sizes and generate the simulation in this manuscript are available on GitHub ( ). \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"abdc8738ea8492f6ab5bee312cc167f0"},

Long-term mind-body exercise has been shown to improve cognitive ability in PD patients, but the methods of assessment and intervention were inconsistent across studies. Wuqinxi is a mind-body exercise that is easy to learn, has few physical and cognitive demands, and is recommended for PD patients. Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) has been associated with cognitive alterations in PD patients, but no studies have yet explored the effects of Wuqinxi on this association. The current protocol is designed to measure the effects of long-term Wuqinxi intervention on cognition in PD patients, and explore the underlying neural mechanisms through DFC. \n\n Methods:   A long-term single-blind, randomized trial will be conducted. PD patients and age- and gender-matched HC will be recruited; PD patients will be randomly assigned to either Wuqinxi or balance groups, and HC will all receive health education. The Wuqinxi group will receive a 90-min session of Wuqinxi intervention three times a week for 24 weeks, while the balance group will receive balance exercise instruction on the same schedule. Primary outcomes will include assessment of cognitive domains and dynamic temporal characteristics of functional connectivity. Secondary outcomes will include severity of motor symptoms, mobility, balance, and emotional state. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, at the end of 24 weeks of intervention, and 12 weeks after interventions have ended. \n\n Discussion:   This study will provide evidence to the effects of Wuqinxi exercise on cognitive improvements in PD patients from the perspective of DFC, and will contribute to the understanding of neural mechanisms underlying cognitive enhancement through Wuqinxi practice. \n\n Clinical Trial Registration:  , identifier ChiCTR2000038517. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor impairment as well as non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment ( ;  ). Previous studies have shown that PD patients have cognitive deficits in executive, attentional, speech and language, visuospatial, and memory domains ( ). Most interventional studies have focused on improving motor ability because it is the classical symptom of PD. Cognitive impairment, however, has not been addressed as thoroughly, even though it not only reduces quality of life for the patient but also increases cost of care and caregiver burden ( ). Cognitive impairment can occur from early to advanced stages of PD. Longitudinal studies have shown that more than 25% of patients with mild cognitive impairment develop dementia within 3 years and up to 50% of patients with early PD develop cognitive decline within 5 years ( ;  ). Thus, the clinical management of cognitive impairment is a long-term challenge, and there is an urgent need to develop evidence-based treatments for cognitive enhancement in PD patients. \n\nNo medications have yet been shown to slow PD progression, but there is substantial evidence for long-term exercise attenuating PD progression ( ). A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study showed that regular exercise was associated with less cognitive decline after 1 year ( ). There is growing evidence that mind-body exercise can improve cognition, executive function, learning, memory, and verbal fluency ( ;  ;  ). However, the methods for intervention and assessment were inconsistent across studies, so it is difficult to draw conclusions about the mechanisms of mind-body exercise on cognition. In order to clarify the mechanisms, we should first focus on only one approach and use a variety of tools to track and assess the effectiveness of the intervention. \n\nPrevious studies have shown that mind-body exercise can improve the cognitive abilities of middle-aged and elderly people ( ). Wuqinxi imitates the movement and breathing patterns of five animals (tigers, deer, bears, apes, and birds) and emphasizes the integration of body, breath, and mind ( ). It is a kind of mind-body exercise which is easy to learn and has few physical and cognitive demands ( ;  ). Thus, PD patients with physical and cognitive impairments may choose Wuqinxi as a complement to medicine ( ). However, few studies have been conducted to find the neural mechanisms underlying the improvements ( ). Thus, this long-term study protocol focuses on Wuqinxi and uses dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) to detect the cognitive changes in PD patients. \n\nStudies have shown that temporal variation in functional connectivity during scanning time reflected cognitive changes in PD patients ( ;  ). Functional connectivity analysis is based on temporal correlations between spatially remote neurophysiological events ( ;  ). In the past, researchers have typically computed static functional connectivity (SFC) with the assumption that it remains constant throughout the duration of the scan ( ;  ). In recent years, however, a large number of researchers realized that functional connectivity in fact varies periodically ( ;  ;  ). Compared with DFC, time averaged SFC ignore the underlying temporal variations of functional connectivity which may provide additional information about brain function ( ). This offers yet another dimension upon which to evaluate disease states, and DFC has since been applied to depression ( ), Alzheimer’s disease ( ), and Parkinson’s disease ( ;  ). Specifically, DFC was found abnormal at the early stage in PD and correlated with disease progression, cognitive impairments ( ;  ;  ). \n\nThe aim of this study protocol is to explore the effects of Wuqinxi intervention for cognitive impairment in PD by DFC analysis. We hypothesize that Wuqinxi will change the temporal characteristics of DFC as well as the motor and cognitive impairments of PD patients. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe current study is designed as a longitudinal, single-blind, randomized controlled trial. The study has been approved by the local research ethics committee. \n\n### Design and Procedures \n  \nPD participants will be recruited through the local hospital’s exercise intervention group. To reduce potential expectation bias and confirm eligibility, a research assistant will make telephone contact with those referred by a neurologist and follow up with interested participants. Healthy controls (HC) will be recruited from the local communities through posters during the same recruitment period. Participants with PD will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Wuqinxi or balance. The total intervention period will be 24 weeks. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline (prior to intervention), immediately following the end of the intervention period, and 12 weeks after the intervention has ended (see  ). All PD participants will follow their regular medication scheme during the study period. This protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai University of Sport (102772020RT107). All participants who meet the inclusion criteria will sign informed consent prior to the study. \n  \nStudy pipeline. \n  \nA recently published protocol “Long-Term Wu Qin Xi Exercise on Response Inhibition and Cortical Connectivity in Parkinson’s Disease: Design and Implementation of a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial” is similar to the current protocol ( ). Our protocol considers the whole brain and will use resting-state fMRI to detect the effects of Wuqinxi on PD patients, while the previously published one only take the primary motor cortex and response inhibition related brain regions (dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, right inferior frontal gyrus, and presupplementary motor area) into consideration and use dual-site paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to evaluate the cortical connectivity. \n\nWe will first follow the methods in Fiorenzato and Kim’s researches to replicate the effects in their work ( ;  ), and then use DFC analysis as the main method to detect the effects of wuqinxin intervention in patients. In order to replicate the effects in Fiorenzato and Kim’s study, HC will be recruited and compared with whole PD patients before the intervention to support that DFC method could be used in our participants. HC will not be involved in the intervention procedure. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \n#### Parkinson’s Disease Patients \n  \n##### Inclusion criteria \n    \nPatients with PD diagnosed according to the UK Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank diagnostic criteria. \n  \nAge 55–75 years old. \n  \nHoehn and Yahr (H&Y) score of 1–3. \n  \n20≤ Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score ≤25. \n  \nAbility to walk and exercise independently. \n  \n\n##### Exclusion criteria \n    \nTai Chi or other exercise habits. \n  \nOther diseases that could interfere with conduct of the study protocol. \n  \nHistory of head injury. \n  \nOther significant psychiatric, neurological, or systemic comorbidity. \n  \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) signal abnormalities (such as cerebral vascular lesions, white matter hyperintensities, and evidence of space-occupying lesions) or artifacts. \n  \nSevere cognitive, visual, or auditory impairment. \n  \nDepression or anxiety. \n  \nDeep brain stimulation. \n  \nMRI contraindications. \n  \nAlcohol or drug dependency or abuse. \n  \n\n\n#### Healthy Controls \n  \n##### Inclusion criteria \n    \nAge 55–75 years old. \n  \nAbility to walk and exercise independently. \n  \n\n##### Exclusion criteria \n    \nTai Chi or other exercise habits. \n  \nOther diseases that could interfere with conduct of the study protocol. \n  \nHistory of head injury. \n  \nOther significant psychiatric, neurological, or systemic comorbidity. \n  \nMRI signal abnormalities (such as cerebral vascular lesions, white matter hyperintensities, and evidence of space-occupying lesions) or artifacts. \n  \nSevere cognitive, visual, or auditory impairment. \n  \nDepression or anxiety. \n  \nMRI contraindications. \n  \nAlcohol or drug dependency or abuse. \n  \n\n\n\n### Sample Size Calculation and Blinding \n  \nSample size estimation was performed by G power V3.1 software (Franz Faul, Universitat Kiel, Germany). According to the analysis, at least 44 participants should be recruited (22 participants per group) in order to be able to perform two-factor repeated ANOVA (within-between interaction) with a middle effect size of 0.25 ( ), level of significance of 0.05, and power of 95% ( ). Since some participants may need to be dropped from the analysis due to excessive head motion during scanning, 40 participants will be recruited for each PD subgroup and 40 HC will be recruited. According to a similar studies published recently ( ;  ), this sample size should be adequate for replicating the previous effects in Fiorenzato’s study. In order to attract more participants, we will offer generous compensation and long-term health guidance. Every participant will be offered with an individual exercise plan when the whole study was completed. Randomization of PD patients will be done at the website  . Two researchers will be trained to assess the outcomes, and they will be blinded to group and will not participate in any interventions. \n\n\n### Interventions \n  \nParticipants in all PD patients’ groups will be asked to record their exercise every day throughout the trial, including both in the laboratory and at home. \n\n#### Wuqinxi Training \n  \nParticipants in the Wuqinxi group will attend a 24-week Wuqinxi exercise program consisting of 90-min group sessions three times a week. Each session will begin with 10 min of warm-up consisting of a breathing exercise, slow walking, and range-of-motion exercises, followed by 60 min of core Wuqinxi exercise (see  ) with a 10-min break in the middle and 10 min of cooldown session consisting of limb range-of-motion movements, sustained stretching, and relaxing. The warm-up will focus on breaking down the movements and getting familiar with the main points of the movements; the later three steps will focus on consistency of movement, fluency of gait, and balance of posture. Heart rates will be monitored throughout the session using Polar Team2 heart rate monitors (Polar Electro, Finland). The intensity and difficulty, timing and frequency of the exercise will be adjusted for each participant based on their heart rate. Participants will be encouraged to practice at home, but not to participate in other exercises during the 24-week intervention period. \n  \nIllustration of Wuqinxi exercise maneuvers.

Each training session will start with a 10 min warm-up (same as wuqinxi training). Then a 30-min balance exercise will be performed twice, with a 10-min break in between. Training will include the following sections: (1) static balance training: standing on unstable surfaces to maintain postural control and progression to weight shifting; (2) dynamic balance training: postural control in standing position while adding upper limb and trunk movements; (3) balance strategy exercise: focus on hip strategy while maintaining ankle strategy and stepping strategy under interference in different directions; and (4) adaptation of varying base of support, and standing in a narrow space and on uneven surface ( ;  ). Each training session will end with a 10-min cooldown session (same as wuqinxi training). \n\n\n#### Healthy Controls \n  \nParticipants in the healthy control group will not receive any intervention exercise. \n\n\n\n### Resting-State and Structural MRI Acquisition and Preprocessing \n  \nResting state functional MRI data and 3D high-dimension T1 image will be collected using a 3T Siemens Magnetom Prisma MRI scanner. PD patients will take medication during MRI scanning to minimize movement artifacts and reduce discomfort. All participants will be instructed to keep their eyes open and focus on a white “+” on black screen, letting their minds wander and trying not to fall asleep during the 10 min 6 s resting state functional MRI scan (gradient echo/fast gradient echo pulse sequence: repetition time = 2000 ms; echo time = 30 ms; flip angle = 80°; matrix size = 106 × 106; number of slices = 62; and voxel size = 2.0 × 2.0 × 2.0 mm  with no gap; number of total volume = 304). During the structural scan participants will be instructed to sleep (repetition time = 3130 ms; echo time = 2.98 ms; flip angle = 4°; matrix size = 256 × 256; number of slice = 176; voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm ). \n\nData preprocessing will be conducted using the SPM12 package implemented in MATLAB R2019a . Prior to preprocessing (1) the first four scans will be deleted from the resting functional volume; (2) functional scans will be realigned to the first volume to correct for interscan head motion; (3) functional scans will be segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid using the Tissue Probability Map template; and finally, and (4) normalized into standard Montreal Neurological Institute space using non-linear transformations and spatially smoothed with a Gaussian smoothing kernel of 6 mm. Participants with head motion greater than 1 mm will be removed from the study ( ). \n\n\n### DFC Characteristics Computation \n  \n#### Group Independent Component Analysis \n  \nAfter preprocessing, the resting state data of all participants will be analyzed using spatial independent component analysis implemented in GIFT  to decompose the data into functional networks that exhibit a unique time course profile. \n\nReduction steps will be carried out at the subject- and group-levels. Subject-specific data will be reduced to 120 components, then concatenated across time. Next, at the group level, data will be reduced to 100 independent components using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Reliability and stability of the infomax independent component analysis algorithm in ICASSO will be ensured by repeating the algorithm 20 times. \n\nThe resulting components will be clustered to estimate their reliability and components with values >0.80 will be saved. Subject-specific spatial maps and time courses will be obtained using the back-reconstruction approach. \n\n\n#### Dynamic functional connectivity \n  \n##### Sliding Window Approach \n  \nSliding window analysis will be applied using the DFC network toolbox in GIFT. Resting state data will be separated into windows of 22 repetition times (44 s), and the regularized inverse covariance matrix will be used as covariance estimation using shorter time series can be noisy. An additional L1 norm of the precision matrix will be imposed to promote sparsity in the graphic LASSO framework with 100 repetitions. Subsequently, the functional connectivity matrices will be transformed to z-scores using Fisher’s z-transformation and covariates (age, gender, and education) will be regressed out. \n\n\n##### Clustering analysis \n  \nA K-means clustering algorithm will be applied to the windowed functional connectivity matrices to assess the recurring functional connectivity patterns (states), as expressed by the frequency and structure of these states. Then a cluster validity analysis will be performed on the exemplars of all subjects to estimate the optimal number of clusters. We will use a subset of windows (local maxima in functional connectivity variance) as subject exemplars to decrease the redundancy between windows and computational demands. The reproducibility of functional connectivity states will be established using bootstrap resampling and split-half sample methods. The optimal number of clusters will be set to   k   = 2 following previous studies which is determined based on the silhouette criterion of cluster validity index ( ;  ). \n\n\n\n\n### Outcome Measures \n  \nAll measurements will be conducted before the intervention begins (baseline), immediately after the 24 weeks of intervention, and 12 weeks after the intervention. \n\n#### Participants’ Characteristics \n  \nDemographic characteristics of all participants will be assessed prior to intervention including age, gender, education, age of onset, disease duration, body mass (kg/m ), height (cm), and family situation (see  ). Levodopa equivalent daily dosages will be calculated for PD patients ( ). \n  \nDemographic characteristics. \n    \n\n#### Primary Outcome Assessment \n  \nThe Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( ) will be conducted to assess cognitive impairment and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status ( ) will be used to measure the cognitive domains of immediate memory, visuospatial, language, attention, and delayed memory (see  ). Dynamic states, dwell times, fractional windows, and number of transitions will be computed to reflect the characteristics of DFC (see  ). \n\n\n#### Secondary Outcome Assessments \n  \nThe Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) will be used to measure the severity of sleep disturbances ( ); Parkinson Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) will be used to assess PD-specific health quality over the previous month ( ); Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT) will be used to evaluate mobility and motor ability ( ); Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS-III) will be used to measure motor symptoms ( ); Hamilton Depression Scale [HAMD] ( ) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale[HAMA] ( ) will be used to evaluate depression and anxiety in both PD patients and HC (see  ). \n\n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nFollowing a previous study ( ), we will investigate the temporal properties of DFC states by computing the average dwell time and fractional windows in each state, as well as the number of transitions from one state to another. \n\n#### Replication of the previous effects \n  \n##### Clinical and Neuropsychological Data Analysis \n  \nStatistical analyses will be performed using SPSS version 19.0. Demographic and clinical information of all PD patients will be compared using two-sample independent   t  -test (see  ). Pearson’s chi-square test will be used to compare categorical variables (see  ). Pearson’s correlation analyses will be applied between temporal properties and cognition (MoCA and cognitive performance in each domain) in whole PD patients as well as motor severity (UPDRS-III) before the intervention (see  ). The threshold for statistical significance will be set at   p   < 0.05. \n  \nCorrelation between dynamic functional connectivity temporal properties and clinical characteristics (before intervention, after intervention, and follow-up). \n    \n\n##### Group differences in dynamic connectivity: temporal and properties and strength \n  \nGroup (whole PD patients vs. HC) differences in dwell time, fractional windows, and number of transitions will be examined using two-sample independent   t  -test analysis (  p   < 0.05, FDR correction, see  ). Covariates will include education, levodopa and dopamine agonist equivalent daily doses. Subsequently, subject-specific medians corresponding to each group-level state will be estimated and two-sample independent   t  -test analysis will be used to compare the connectivity strength of each state at each unique regional pairing (  p   < 0.05, FDR correction) between groups (whole PD patients vs. HC), see  . Further, two-sample independent   t  -test analysis will be performed to compare strength abnormalities associated with cognitive deficits by comparing whole PD patients and HC (  p   < 0.05, FDR correction), see  . \n\n\n\n#### Application of DFC in Wuqinxi Intervention \n  \n##### Clinical and neuropsychological data analysis \n  \nStatistical analyses will be performed using SPSS version 19.0. Demographic and clinical information of two PD subgroups (wuqinxi group vs. balance group) will be compared across the three timepoints (baseline, 24 weeks, and 12-week follow-up) using two-factor repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA), see  . Pearson’s chi-square test will be used to compare categorical variables (see  ). Pearson’s correlation analyses will be applied between temporal properties and cognition (MoCA and cognitive performance in each domain) across two PD subgroups as well as motor severity (UPDRS-III) before the intervention (see  ). Then, the same correlation analyses will be used after the intervention and will also be carried out after follow-up (see  ). The threshold for statistical significance will be set at   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n##### Group differences in dynamic connectivity: temporal and properties and strength \n  \nBetween-group (wuqinxigroup vs. balance group) differences in dwell time, fractional windows, and number of transitions will be examined using two-factor repeated ANOVA (  p   < 0.05, FDR correction), see  . Covariates will include education, levodopa and dopamine agonist equivalent daily doses. Continuously, subject-specific medians corresponding to each group-level state will be estimated and two-factor repeated ANOVA will be used to compare the connectivity strength of each state at each unique regional pairing (  p   < 0.05, FDR correction) between the three timepoints (before intervention, after intervention, and follow-up), see  . Finally, two-factor repeated ANOVA will be performed to compare strength abnormalities associated with cognitive deficits by comparing different timepoints of Wuqinxi group and balance group (  p   < 0.05, FDR correction), see  . \n\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo date, little is understood about the neural mechanisms underlying the improvement of cognitive ability in PD patients after mind-body exercise. Previous studies suggested that mind-body exercise can enhance cognitive performance in PD patients ( ;  ;  ). Among the various types of mind-body exercises, Wuqinxi has often been recommended as a complement to medicine to treat cognitive impairment ( ). Thus, the present study proposes a longitudinal protocol for enhancing cognition in PD patients with Wuqinxi intervention. \n\nPrevious studies have shown that dynamic temporal properties can reflect cognitive alterations in PD patients ( ;  ). Two distinct connectivity ‘states’ have been observed in PD patients: one is more frequent and characterized by a predominance of within-network connections, while the other is less frequent and characterized by between-network connections ( ). The dwell time and transitions between these two states was significantly correlated with various cognitive domains in PD patients, suggesting that analysis of these states may help to further our understanding of neural mechanisms of cognitive enhancement. DFC provides a method with which to explore the effects of Wuqinxi at the brain network level, complementing the traditional evidence that focuses more on behavioral performance and motor function ( ). \n\nThere are a few shortcomings and in this protocol that have to be considered. First, we calculated the simple size following the principles of behavior science ( ), but it may still be small for neuroscience. Second, we cannot exclude that dopaminergic therapy will have some effect on functional connectivity ( ). Third, the depression/anxiety of patients may will also have effect on functional connectivity ( ;  ). Further, it is difficult to guarantee that after randomization wuqinxin- and balance-group is strict matched for baseline cognition. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai University of Sport.

Characterizing metastable functional connectivity (FC) – particularly at rest and using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) – has shaped the field of dynamic functional connectivity (DFC). Mainstream DFC research relies on (sliding window) correlations to identify recurrent FC patterns. Recently, functional relevance of the   instantaneous phase synchrony   (IPS) of fMRI signals has been revealed using imaging studies and computational models. In the present paper, we identify the repertoire of whole-brain inter-network IPS states at rest. Moreover, we uncover a hierarchy in the temporal organization of IPS modes. We hypothesize that connectivity disorder in schizophrenia (SZ) is related to the (deep) temporal arrangement of large-scale IPS modes. Hence, we analyze resting-state fMRI data from 68 healthy controls (HC) and 51 SZ patients. Seven resting-state networks (and their sub-components) are identified using spatial independent component analysis. IPS is computed between subject-specific network time courses, using analytic signals. The resultant phase coupling patterns, across time and subjects, are clustered into eight IPS states. Statistical tests show that the relative expression and mean lifetime of certain IPS states have been altered in SZ. Namely, patients spend (45%) less time in a globally coherent state and a subcortical-centered state, and (40%) more time in states reflecting anticoupling within the cognitive control network, compared to the HC. Moreover, the transition profile (between states) reveals a deep temporal structure, shaping two metastates with distinct phase synchrony profiles. A metastate is a collection of states such that within-metastate transitions are more probable than across. Remarkably, metastate occupation balance is altered in SZ, in favor of the less synchronous metastate that promotes disconnection across networks. Furthermore, the trajectory of IPS patterns is less efficient, less smooth, and more restricted in SZ subjects, compared to the HC. Finally, a regression analysis confirms the diagnostic value of the defined IPS measures for SZ identification, highlighting the distinctive role of metastate proportion. Our results suggest that the proposed IPS features may be used for classification studies and for characterizing phase synchrony modes in other (clinical) populations. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nGrowing evidence suggests that large-scale functional connectivity (FC) is inherently   transient  . That is, functional networks reconfigure not only in response to task demands ( ) but also during resting state ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ). Importantly, transient FC at rest has neuronal underpinnings, as evidenced by concurrent imaging and electrophysiological recordings ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ) and emergent dynamics from computational models ( ,  ;  ;  ). Moreover, recent findings show that spontaneous FC patterns are quasi-periodically   recurrent   ( ), and their temporal organization is non-random ( ;  ). Hence, dynamical organization of resting-state connectivity has been conceptualized as nonstop (and non-random) excursion through a bounded repertoire of metastable connectivity modes, called   states   ( ;  ;  ). \n\nNeuroimaging furnishes non-invasive investigation of metastable brain phenomena, at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Specifically, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is popular for its high spatial resolution and inherent circumvention of the inverse problem (i.e., source localization). As such, various techniques have been developed to capture regularities in the evolving spatiotemporal patterns of fMRI signals ( ;  ;  ). Conventional dynamic FC (DFC) techniques track the statistical dependencies between neuroimaging series in successive epochs of data, which is known as the   sliding window   approach. Notably, window size has been a controversial parameter, posing a trade-off between the temporal resolution and statistical significance of the observed FC fluctuations ( ;  ;  ). Meanwhile, a recent addition to the set of DFC measures is the instantaneous phase synchrony (IPS) of fMRI series, which eschews the window complications ( ) and has shown functional relevance in empirical and modeling studies. \n\nInstantaneous phase synchrony is relatively new in fMRI ( ;  ;  ) despite being an established measure for analyzing electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and electrophysiological recordings ( ;  ,  ). Once applied to fMRI signals, IPS reflects momentary phase alignment in the slow fluctuations of hemodynamic responses. Adopting IPS as a DFC measure can improve the temporal resolution of connectivity variations from the size of the window (typically 30–120 s) to the sampling time of the imaging modality (usually TR = 0.7–3 s). \n\nFollowing evidence regarding the temporal variability of fMRI phase relationships within and between functional networks ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), verifying and characterizing the   spontaneous recurrence   of these patterns at rest and their functional relevance came into focus. The challenge is that, the instantaneity of IPS measures (between regions or networks) comes at the expense of noisy and irregular functional patterns, with spatiotemporal order that is not easy to capture. Early attempts relied on thresholding instantaneous phase couplings, converting them to binary patterns before further analysis ( ;  ). In particular,   used non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) to decompose a series of thresholded IPS matrices into the weighted sum of simpler (recurrent) components. This joint modeling and empirical study showed that phase interactions over a structurally plausible network give rise to recurrent synchronization patterns that resemble empirical arrangements – namely, the resting-state networks ( ). However, the threshold level (Δϕ = π /6) that defines phase synchrony had been chosen arbitrarily in this research. More recent studies ( ;  ) avoid thresholding, but represent each bivariate IPS matrix by its first eigenvector, and apply (k-means) clustering on these summary vectors to identify recurring arrangements. This is also a practical approach that inevitably discards some of the phase coupling information, and still struggles with cluster validation ( ). In short, finding natural order in IPS data has not been straightforward, despite certain simplifications. \n\nRecently, conventional DFC  studies have disclosed more sophisticated spatiotemporal order in resting-state data, which remains to be verified in the phase coupling realm. That is because, any connectomic order arising from correlation-based DFC analyses does not necessarily generalize to IPS dynamics, due to their inherently different mathematical properties and timescale, moderate association between their temporal variations and non-linear relationship on a topological level (in terms of time averages) ( ). In the following, we review some prominent DFC findings, which have not been investigated using phase relationships and motivated the present analysis: \n  \nRecent studies have revealed a   hierarchical organization   in the (non-random) temporal arrangement of functional states at rest ( ); i.e., temporal order beyond sample-to-sample transitions. Importantly, this slower temporal organization is heritable and related to personality traits ( ,  ). Currently, we do not know whether the spontaneous recurrence of IPS patterns is similarly governed by a deep temporal arrangement. \n  \nIt was lately shown that the   trajectory   of connectivity evolution holds functionally relevant information, which becomes obscured in the usual cluster analyses ( ). The IPS trajectory may also bear functionally relevant information, especially given its high (single-TR) temporal resolution. \n  \nFunctional integration is inherently multi-scale; that is, it coordinates neurons, micro-columns, and macroscopic regions (which form functional networks) and also organizes large-scale network interactions. Ongoing network interactions reflect higher-order functional organization in the brain, which is related to one’s character and cognitive performance ( ) and is modulated in various disorders ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). So far, a good number of IPS studies have relied on (anatomical) atlases ( ;  ;  ) or have investigated few functional networks ( ); some have not been concerned with the recurrence of IPS modes ( ;  ) or their recurrence characterizations have not been purely phase-based  ( ,  ). Hence, current literature has not portrayed the repertoire of whole-brain inter-network IPS states based strictly on phase relationships – which could furnish new insights into the large-scale dynamic functional connectome. Notably, if large-scale phase couplings hold functional information – as speculated – they may also be modulated in neurological and psychiatric disorders. \n  \nSchizophrenia  (SZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder, which has affected some 23.6 million people worldwide by 2013, with a lifetime prevalence of about 1% ( ). SZ is commonly known as a connectivity disorder . In 1998,   proposed a   disconnection hypothesis   for SZ that stemmed from positron emission tomography (PET) findings. Ever since, fMRI has expedited the examination of disrupted functional organization of the brain in SZ ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Dysfunctional connections within and across brain regions have been frequently reported in SZ studies . Importantly, SZ disconnection affects between-network interactions as well, based on prior (correlation-based) DFC analyses ( ;  ). It remains to be investigated whether instantaneous phase coupling of functional networks reflects disconnection in SZ, and whether whole-brain network-level IPS measures hold diagnostic value in this context. \n  \nIn the present work, we try to address the above questions in an empirical study. Specifically, we analyze a publicly available SZ dataset while extending IPS characterization to higher functional and temporal levels. We hypothesize that disconnection in SZ relates to the spatial and (deep) temporal organization of network level IPS modes, and to the trajectory of large-scale phase coupling patterns, in this disorder. The results on SZ show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which may be used in other applications as well. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Dataset and Pre-processing \n  \nWe used the SZ dataset of the Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) ( ). The dataset comprises of 72 SZ patients and 75 healthy subjects (18–65 years old). The patients had been diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) ( ). Any subject with history of neurological disorder, mental retardation, severe head trauma, active substance abuse or dependence within the past year had been excluded from the study. Each participant was scanned at rest for 5 min on a 3-T Siemens Tim Trio scanner, and instructed to fixate on a central cross. A total of 150 (T2 -weighted) functional volumes were acquired using a gradient-echo EPI sequence (TR = 2 s, TE = 29 ms, flip angle = 75°, 33 axial slices, ascending acquisition, matrix size = 64 × 64, voxel size = 3.75 × 3.75 × 4.55 mm, field of view = 240 mm). A high-resolution T1-weighted structural image was also collected for each subject. \n\nFunctional images were pre-processed in SPM12 software  as follows: the first five volumes were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration; the remaining images were realigned (i.e., head motion corrected), slice-timing corrected, co-registered to the anatomical image of the subject, warped to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template ( ), resampled to 3   mm   isotropic voxels and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 6 mm). Global signal was not removed ( ). Based on the motion realignment parameters, framewise displacement (FD) was computed as the total absolute head motion between consecutive time points, assuming 50-mm head radius for converting rotations to translations ( ). Nine subjects with maximum head translation exceeding 3 mm were removed; 12 patients with mean framewise displacement (MFD) above 0.7 mm were left out; and 5 normal females were excluded to match gender proportion. Hence, 119 subjects (68 healthy controls [HC]/51 SZ) were retained, whose demographics have been included in  . Two-sample   t   tests on the maximum head translation, MFD, and age, plus chi-squared test on the gender proportion did not show significant difference between the two groups (uncorrected   p  -values = 0.78, 0.20, 0.82, and 0.16, respectively). \n  \nDemographics and clinical information of the participants. \n  \n\n### Spatially Constrained Spatial Independent Component Analysis \n  \nIn order to achieve a refined functional parcellation of the brain, we used aggregate functional networks from   as   spatial priors   to run (spatially) constrained spatial ICA (csICA) ( ) on each subject. This approach has a number of advantages: (1) csICA respects spatial variability of the networks across subjects – unlike fixed network templates; (2) csICA optimizes independence of the ICs (i.e., the networks) at the subject level and simultaneously maintains their correspondence across the group; (3) csICA has superior performance  compared to a number of other established (principal component/regression based) back-reconstruction techniques ( ;  ;  ); (4) csICA allows for the propagation of aggregate networks to individuals who were not included in the original group analysis. This follows because the spatial priors of csICA need to be only “partially correct” in this method ( ). \n\nHence, we adopted the 50 aggregate networks (estimated from a 100-component  group spatial ICA analysis on 405 subjects in  , and implemented constrained spatial ICA ( ) on the preprocessed data of every participant, using the Group ICA of fMRI Toolbox (GIFT ). Notably, the artifactual components (i.e., the physiological, head movement, and imaging artifact components) had already been identified and excluded in  , such that the remaining 50 functional parcels comprise sub-components of reproducible large-scale resting-state networks ( ;  ;  ;  ). These networks include the subcortical (SC), auditory (AUD), somatomotor (SM), visual (VIS), cognitive control (CC), default mode network (DMN), and cerebellum (CB) ( ). For more details about the spatial maps of the networks and their peak coordinates, please see Supplementary Figure S2 and Supplementary Table S1 in  . For a schematic illustration of csICA please refer to the flowchart in  . \n  \nFlowchart of analysis and an illustrative example.   (A)   Resting-state fMRI data from each subject is decomposed using (spatially) constrained spatial independent component analysis (csICA) into C sub-networks (C = 50), based on the aggregate network templates from  . Time series corresponding to subject-specific networks are converted to complex analytic signals, from which instantaneous phases are extracted. Instantaneous phase synchrony (IPS) is computed as cosine of the difference between momentary phases, for each pair of networks and per subject. Time indexed IPS matrices of all subjects are clustered using spectral clustering. The three-dimensional plot (third row, right panel) shows an exemplar stack of IPS matrices projected on a (low-dimensional manifold, which is spanned by the first three principal components (PC). Cluster analysis assigns each data point (which is an IPS matrix) to one cluster centroid (i.e., a state). The color of each filled circle reflects the state label assigned to that IPS pattern, where only three states where assumed in this example. Trajectory analysis is conducted on the same IPS matrices (per subject), independently from cluster analysis. A number of measures are defined (in  ) to quantify the state and trajectory characteristics. These IPS measures are quantified and statistically compared between healthy controls (HC) and schizophrenia (SZ) patients.   (B)   An illustrative example highlighting the difference between cluster and trajectory analyses. Gray dots represent eight IPS matrices projected on their first two principal components. Arrows indicate temporal progression of the patterns, for a hypothetical session. The colorful ellipses correspond to three identified clusters. Hence, all the data points encompassed by one ellipse bear the same state label. The output of cluster analysis is a state sequence and a corresponding transition matrix (middle and right panels). Conversely, trajectory analysis focuses on sample-to-sample variations in the IPS patterns. For instance, the sum of the (L1) norms of all the black arrows constitutes the   trajectory length  . Also, the (L1) distance between the two farthest points is defined as the   span   of the trajectory. For the full list of IPS measures, please refer to  .) \n    \nMeasures of instantaneous phase synchrony (IPS). \n      \nStatic functional network connectivity (sFNC) analysis.   (A)   Average sFNC pattern for the healthy control (HC, upper panel) and schizophrenic (SZ, lower panel) group. Diagonal (unity) entries have been removed for better visualization.   (B)   Difference in sFNC (HC–SZ). The color bar denotes −10log(  q  )×  s   i   g   n  (  t  −  s   t   a   t   i   s   t   i   c  ), following two-sample   t   test on Fisher   z  -transformed correlation values (  z   = atan  h  (  r  )). The 50 sub-networks and their organization into seven major networks have been reflected in the labels. Sub-network labels reflect the brain region with peak amplitude and refer to bilateral activations unless specified as left (L) or right (R).

That is, the time series were detrended to remove low-frequency scanner drift, orthogonalized with respect to the subject’s estimated motion parameters and their derivatives, and despiked to replace outlier points. Despiking was performed using AFNI’s 3dDespike algorithm which detects outlier time points (based on the median absolute deviation) and replaces them with interpolated values from a third-order spline fitted to the adjacent time points ( ). \n\n\n### Static Functional Network Connectivity \n  \nAverage connectivity among the networks over the whole session was computed (for each subject) as the sample covariance matrix of the network time courses. Since resting-state FC is primarily shaped by low-frequency fluctuations of fMRI signals ( ), the network time series were bandpass filtered between (0.01 and 0.15) Hz (using a 5th-order Butterworth filter) before computing the static functional network connectivity (sFNC) matrices. Furthermore, sFNC was calculated for each group by averaging over their respective subjects. To highlight group differences, two-sample   t   tests were performed on each entry of the (Fisher   z  -transformed) sFNC matrices, and   p  -values were adjusted for multiple comparison using the false discovery rate (FDR) approach ( ). Following convention,   q   < 0.05 was considered statistical significance. \n\n\n### Instantaneous Phase Synchrony \n  \nThe analytic representation of a real valued signal   x  (  t  ) is a complex signal   x  (  t  ), with no negative frequency components. This complex signal can be constructed from the real signal using the Hilbert transform as follows ( ): \n\nwhere ℋ{.} denotes the Hilbert transform and   j   is the imaginary unit. The main property of analytic signal, x (t), is that its Fourier transform is the same as that of the original real-valued signal, but only covers the positive frequencies. As a result, this complex (analytic) signal converts the original time series into two separate time series (which are the real and imaginary parts), from which useful aspects of the signal can be studied – such as instantaneous phase. In particular, for a   narrowband   signal expressed as   x  (  t  ) =   a  (  t  )cos(ϕ(  t  )), the corresponding analytical representation is ( ): \n\nwhere   a  (  t  ) and ϕ(  t  ) are instantaneous envelope and instantaneous phase, respectively. Hence, for two real narrowband signals (  x  (  t  ) and   x  (  t  )), the difference between their instantaneous phases reflects their phase synchrony. To get a normalized measure between −1 and +1, the cosine of the phase difference is considered ( ;  ): \n\nSo, when the instantaneous phases of two signals fully align at time t, IPS(  t  ) reaches its maximum value of +1; conversely, for 180° phase difference, this measure falls to −1, reminiscent of the familiar correlation and anti-correlation notions (herein called coupling and anticoupling). \n\nThe post-processed network time courses in our study were bandpass filtered in the 0.01–0.08 Hz range ( ) using Parks-McClellan linear-phase finite impulse response filter ( ;  ). The corresponding analytic signals were used to compute instantaneous phase series (Eqs. 1 and 2). Subsequently, IPS was calculated for each pair of networks (  p   and   q  ) at each time point (using Eq. 3) to construct time-dependent IPS matrices ( ). These phase coupling matrices reflect the momentary phase similarities of   C=50   resting-state (sub)networks, for each subject. The outstanding task was to characterize the recurrence of these IPS patterns. \n\n\n### Identifying Recurrent IPS Patterns \n  \nIn order to identify the main modes of phase coupling, across time and subjects, we used cluster analysis. Clustering relies on some measure of (dis)similarity between the samples, which are symmetric IPS matrices in this context. A common measure of similarity is   cosine similarity  : \n\nwhere   is a vector holding the unique (upper or lower triangular) entries in the symmetric IPS matrix of the   m   subject, at time   t  ; the dot in the numerator stands for dot product and ||⋅|| is the magnitude (i.e., Euclidean norm). We work with a related measure called   angular similarity  , defined as follows: \n\nAngular similarity varies between 0 and 1, and this positivity is useful for constructing an unsigned graph  (to perform spectral clustering, in what follows). Moreover, angular distance satisfies the triangle inequality (unlike cosine distance) and qualifies as a proper distance metric. Note that we have not performed data reduction on the phase coupling matrices prior to (angular) similarity computation, in order to retain maximal information about the phase synchrony patterns. \n\nAs such, for   M   subject sessions, each comprising   N   time samples, an   M   N  ×  M   N   (angular) similarity matrix was computed. A representative portion of this matrix has been illustrated in  . From this similarity matrix, a (weighted undirected unsigned) graph was constructed, which has been schematically depicted in  . Graph representation furnishes the use of concepts and tools from graph theory. In particular,   spectral graph theory   is the mathematical field of studying graph properties from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of their associated adjacency and Laplacian  matrices. For instance, optimally partitioning a graph into a number of sub-graphs is an NP-hard problem for which   spectral clustering   has offered computationally tractable (approximate) solutions ( ;  ). \n  \nIdentifying recurrent IPS patterns through cluster analysis.   (A)   Top plot shows a representative portion of the (symmetric) angular similarity matrix for 40 consecutive IPS patterns. That is, each entry denotes the angular similarity between two time-indexed IPS matrices (Eq. 5). Recurrent transient patterns are automatically placed in the same cluster, following spectral clustering. For instance, IPS patterns realized between time points 5 and 11 (enclosed by a black square on the diagonal) are highly similar to each other and to the patterns emerging over time samples 20–26. Hence, IPS matrices from both periods identify with the same cluster number (i.e., state 1), as illustrated in the lower panel.   (B)   Schematic of an (undirected weighted) graph associated with an angular similarity matrix. Each node corresponds to a time-indexed IPS matrix, and edge thickness reflects angular similarity. Using spectral clustering, this graph can be optimally divided into well-connected groups of nodes that are plausibly separated from each other, comprising the clusters of interest.   (C)   Cluster validity is established using the Davies–Bouldin index (which is the ratio of within-cluster scatter to between-cluster distance) quantified for a range of 2–10 clusters. The lowest value of this index reflects the most plausible clustering solution, which is eight for our data. The associated cluster centroids are illustrated in  . \n  \nWe used the spectral clustering algorithm of  . In this method, a low-dimensional representation of the pairwise similarity matrix is constructed from the   k   smallest eigenvectors  of the normalized graph Laplacian matrix. These vectors constitute the columns of a new matrix, whose (normalized) rows serve as the feature vectors for a clustering algorithm. We used Gaussian mixture model (GMM) at this stage. To establish the optimal (  k  ) number of clusters, the same procedure was repeated for   k   = 2–10 components and Davies–Bouldin index  ( ) was used to score cluster validity ( ). The optimal number of components (8 in this case) was selected and the resultant cluster centroids comprised the dominant   states   of inter-network phase coupling, across time and subjects ( ). Thereafter, each time-indexed IPS matrix was assigned to the most plausible centroid (i.e., state) based on its posterior probability of assignment (which is called hard assignment in the clustering literature). \n  \nInstantaneous phase synchrony (IPS) states, in three representations.   (A)   Eight cluster centroids, depicted in matrix format. Each centroid stands for an IPS state. The relative expression of each state (across time and subjects) is printed above it. Surface colors reflect IPS values (Eq. 3). Matrix representation offers a detailed account of the phase coupling structure of each state, within and across seven functional networks.   (B)   The first eigenvector of each state is presented as a bar plot. Positive and negative entries constitute two detached communities.   (C)   State connectograms are concise representations of average inter-network phase couplings, where the average is taken over sub-components of each network. For instance, the central role of the subcortical (SC) network in state 2 is readily recognized by noting the warm colored arcs extending from SC to other networks. SC, subcortical; AUD, auditory; SM, somatomotor; VIS, visual; CC, cognitive control; DMN, default mode network; CB, cerebellum. For the sub-network abbreviations, please refer to the caption of  . \n \n. \n \n\n### Characterization of IPS Transient Behavior \n  \nFollowing hard/crisp clustering, every IPS matrix (at each time point) bears one state label ∈ {1:8}. The resultant sequence of states per subject (see  , lower panel) was used to characterize the transient expression of phase synchrony modes over time. Specifically, we call the fraction of IPS patterns assigned to each state the   prevalence   of that state. Other properties of interest are the probability of   transition   between states, the probability of remaining in a particular state (called   dwell  ), and the average period over which a state is held continuously (called   persistence  ). These measures are summarized in  . They were computed per subject and compared between (HC and SZ) groups using permutation-based two-sample   t   tests, followed by FDR correction for multiple comparisons. \n\nWe also investigated the relationship between the transition probability and the similarity of states. It has been suggested that transition probability between states is related to their connectomic similarity; i.e., the brain undergoes smooth connectivity changes over time ( ). Specifically, a significant positive correlation between the connectomic similarity of (correlation-based) functional states and the transition probability between them has been reported ( ). We intended to test the same hypothesis about phase synchrony modes and their transition profile. We tested, additionally, for any correlation between transition probabilities and state prevalence (and persistence) similarities. The correlation values are reported alongside 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which were derived from 1000 bootstrap resamplings of the subjects. \n\n\n### Deep Temporal Organization of Phase Synchrony Modes \n  \nRecent DFC research has revealed a hierarchy in the temporal organization of connectivity states at rest ( ). In other words, the repertoire of connectivity modes comprises of groups of states (called   metastates  ) such that within-metastate transitions are more probable than across. So, once the brain enters a metastate, it is more likely to circulate within that community of states for a while, before switching into another metastate. This speaks to a separation of temporal scales, i.e., a temporal hierarchy. That is to say, the dynamics of the metastates and states unfold on slower and faster timescales, respectively. So far, this deep temporal organization has been endorsed for correlation-based connectivity modes. \n\nSimilarly, to examine whether the temporal arrangement of phase synchrony states conforms to a hierarchy, we looked for communities within the transition matrix. By regarding the transition probabilities as adjacency values, the transition matrix can be treated as an adjacency matrix, with an associated graph. Due to the small number of states (i.e., 8), we looked into the coarsest division of the transition matrix (into two partitions). In spectral graph theory, bi-partitioning can be achieved using the Fiedler vector (which is the second smallest eigenvector) of the graph Laplacian ( ), using the sign of the corresponding vector entries. In other words, positive and negative entries of the Fiedler vector determine how the graph nodes (here states) can be placed into two maximally disjoint partitions. This is an approximate solution to the minimum-cut partitioning problem on graphs ( ). The result was validated using hierarchical clustering. The presence of distinct well-connected communities in the transition matrix would demonstrate temporal order beyond sample to sample switching. If plausible metastates exist, the remaining task would be investigating their phase synchrony profiles and temporal characteristics – plus potential alterations in SZ. \n\n\n### Trajectory of Phase Coupling Evolution \n  \nCluster analysis is a useful approach for capturing the overall composition and transience of phase couplings patterns. With the usual crisp assignment, all the IPS matrices that belong to a particular cluster collapse onto one dimension (which is the state label), disregarding individual differences and proximity to the center or boundary of the cluster. Previous DFC work ( ) has shown that this crude dimensionality reduction overlooks information in the   trajectory   of connectivity and could over/underestimate connectomic variations. \n\nTo circumvent this issue,   have reparameterized time-dependent connectivity patterns by discretizing their probabilistic assignments to a few prototypical states (derived from data decomposition). In other words, they have projected time-dependent connectivity patterns on (five) representative connectivity modes and discretized the resultant coefficients; thus, summarizing each connectivity pattern with a five-element integer vector. This method reveals valuable trajectory information and is more indicative of time to time connectivity differences than hard (crisp) state assignment. However, this approach still depends on data decomposition, followed by projection and discretization, and the FC patterns are derived from signal correlations, over successive windows. Instead, we intended to follow the trajectory of IPS patterns, in a high-dimensional space and at every time point, without resorting to decomposition and discretization. Hence, we defined a number of intuitive measures to characterize the evolution of phase couplings. In the following, we describe these measures. \n\nDue to the high-dimensional nature of the IPS matrices (with 50×49/2 = 1225 unique features), L1 norm  is a more effective dissimilarity measure than L2 (Euclidean) distance ( ). So, we computed   trajectory length   as the sum  of L1 distances between successive IPS matrices, per subject session; hence, trajectory length =  . Plus, the maximum L1 distance (over all IPS patterns in a session) was taken as the   span   of the trajectory: span =  ;   i  ,  j   ∈ {1:  N  }. Although informative, this maximum value does not reflect dispersion of the realized IPS patterns over the hyperspace (see schematic trajectory in  ). Hence, by averaging over all pairwise L1 distances (per subject) we computed the   capacity   of the trajectory; i.e., capacity =  . Furthermore, the trajectory   efficiency   was defined as the ratio of capacity to trajectory length, for each subject. In this sense, an efficient trajectory traverses a large portion of the state space (i.e., realizes diverse patterns) with relatively small steps; conversely, a very inefficient trajectory is a long one (with large misplanned steps) that eventually remains confined in a small hyperspace. \n\nAnother useful feature is the   smoothness   of the trajectory. Smoothness was defined as the average of L1 similarities between consecutive IPS patterns (per subject), where L1 similarity stands for the reciprocal of L1 distance; hence, smoothness =  . Using these measures, we looked for potential modulations of the phase coupling evolution in the patient group. For a summary of the measures defined in this section please refer to the lower section of  . \n\n\n### Phase Synchrony Features as SZ Predictors \n  \nWe used the phase synchrony measures, introduced in the previous sections, to predict the SZ label using a linear regression model. Age, gender, and MFD were considered as potential confounds. The model was set up as follows: \n\nwhere   y   is a binary vector with SZ diagnosis coded as 1 and HC as 0. The linear relationship between each IPS measure (  X  ) and the diagnosis label (  y  ) was inspected separately. Moreover, an   F   test was also conducted on each regression model to assess the significance of the linear relationship.   p  -values were FDR corrected and significance corresponds to   q   < 0.05. Hence, for each measure, we report the adjusted   R  , β , and   q   values. \n\n\n### Validation Analyses \n  \n#### Subject-Specificity of Networks \n  \nTo investigate individual differences in the estimated ICs and their correspondence to the aggregate networks, we followed the validation procedure in  . Namely, subject components were variance normalized and a voxel-wise one-sample   t   test was performed on each of the 50 components, across subjects. Each   t  -map was subsequently thresholded at an FDR corrected   q   < 0.01. The normalized spatial correlation of subject-specific (FDR-corrected) IC maps with the corresponding IC templates was computed. Average correlation for each subject, over all ICs, was in the (0.6–0.74) range. These values reflect high correspondence of individual networks to the templates [when compared with the (0.43–0.63) range in  ], as well as considerable amount of inter-subject variability. Notably, (normalized) spatial correlation to the template was always above 0.45 for any subject-specific IC, averaged around 0.69, and reached as high as 0.88. These results have been demonstrated in  . \n\n\n#### Genuineness of IPS Modes \n  \nTo verify that the identified IPS patterns reflect genuine phase arrangements, the same cluster analysis was repeated on surrogate data. Relevant literature recommends phase shuffling ( ;  ;  ) and random circular shifting ( ;  ) for generating surrogates. The former shuffles the phase spectra of the original time series while keeping the amplitude spectra unchanged. The latter applies a random circular shift to each of the original series, to disrupt the existing synchrony between them, while temporal dependencies within each series are preserved. We used both approaches and generated two sets of surrogates. If the clusters in the original dataset reflect meaningful and recurrent phase synchrony modes, they should be distinct from patterns identified from surrogate data. \n\n\n#### Motion Effect \n  \nTo inspect whether head motion is related to the emergence of any state, we investigated the correlations between state occurrences and concomitant FDs. Moreover, we checked for systematic differences between FDs associated with different states. That is, we computed average FD for each state, per subject:  , where    s    is the state label and   i   is the subject index. Then, we conducted a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA to test for difference in the means of these state-dependent average-FDs. \n\n\n#### Drowsiness Effect \n  \nA prior DFC study ( ) has reported one FC state associated with drowsiness or light sleep. This speculation was based on the increasing occurrence rate of that state over time. To inspect this possibility, we fitted a line to the occurrence rate (in five-sample windows) of each state over time, for each subject. The slopes of the fitted lines were examined for potential non-zero trend using one-sample   t   test. If a state is associated with drowsiness, its occurrence rate is likely to show a positive trend over the length of the scan. \n\n\n#### Smoothing Kernel Effect \n  \nTo inspect sensitivity of the findings to the width of the smoothing kernel (in pre-processing), we repeated our analysis for data smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with FWHM = 9 mm. Recent research suggests that kernels spanning 2–3 voxels are optimal for fMRI preprocessing prior to ICA analysis at the subject level ( ). From this validation analysis, we found that our key results (i.e., the nature of the states and metastates and their temporal profiles, as well as the IPS trajectory features and their alterations in SZ) are robustly replicated even with this wider kernel. The results have been provided as  . \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### sFNC Indicates Disconnection in SZ \n  \n illustrates group-specific sFNC patterns, obtained for each subject and then averaged over each group. The average patterns reveal well-known modular organization within sensory systems and default mode components, as well as anticorrelation between them ( ;  ;  ). Group difference in sFNC (HC–SZ) is demonstrated in   as −10log(  q  )×  s   i   g   n  (  t  −  s   t   a   t   i   s   t   i   c  ). Significant differences have been marked in bold squares in the lower triangular part (corresponding to   q   < 0.05). From 1225 unique sFNC entries, 18% are significantly different between the two groups (13% have higher mean value in the HC group and 5% are higher in SZ). Specifically, stronger correlation among sensory areas of normal subjects as well as pronounced subcortical-sensory anticorrelation (compared to SZ patients) is in accordance with previous findings ( ). Moreover, a two-sample   t   test on the ensemble of the matrix entries showed that sFNC is globally stronger in normal subjects (  p   < 1e−4). \n\n\n### Recurrent IPS States Comprise Distinct and Diverse Patterns \n  \nThe representative portion of the angular similarity matrix in   indicates that phase coupling evolution is gradual (hence the heavy diagonal). Moreover, similar patterns emerge over non-adjacent epochs, creating the bright off-diagonal patches. The goal of cluster analysis on IPS patterns was to quantify this recurrence. Using spectral clustering, eight distinct IPS arrangements were identified, which recur over time and across subjects. By associating each IPS matrix with one state label, a sequence of states was formed (see  , lower panel). The overall prevalence of each state has been imprinted on top of the corresponding matrix in  . \n\n shows the cluster centroids (i.e., the IPS states) in three formats: matrices, eigenvectors, and connectograms. Clearly, the states differ in their functional architectures. State 1 denotes high level of phase synchrony within and across most networks, while parts of DMN, CB, and CC are decoupled from each other. In state 2, SC and AUD show strong (anti)coupling with respect to the rest of the networks. State 3 reflects notable phase coupling within and across CC, DMN, and CB. In state 4, SC and AUD have strong synchrony with other components while SM, VIS, CC, DMN, and CB are mostly anticoupled or decoupled. State 5 shows an internally incoherent CC, which is also anticoupled to DMN and CB, while DMN is internally integrated. In state 6, (parts of) VIS and CC are anticoupled within and across each other and have mixed (coupling and anticoupling) relationship to DMN and CB. State 7 is noted for strong SC connections, disintegrated CC, and anticoupling of AUD to SM and CC. State 8 is a decoupled state on average, with faintly more synchronous VIS and slightly anticoupled CC. Note that the (unity) diagonal values have been removed from all matrices to improve image contrast. \n\n provide alternative useful representations of the states. Bar plots in   illustrate the first eigenvectors of the states. Hence, the complex coupling and anticoupling relations in each state make up the detached modes in the leading eigenvectors ( ;  ;  ). The connectograms in panel C show average across-network phase couplings, which serve as concise representations of large-scale IPS modes. Of note is the variety of the patterns identified from empirical data. We will see (in the Results section) that these functional architectures are distinct from accidental phase synchrony arrangements obtained from surrogate data. \n\n also shows that, averaged over all subjects, empirical state 1 is the least common (with 11% prevalence) while state 2 is visited most often (18% prevalence). In the next section, we will inspect group-specific results and show that SZ state proportion is profoundly different from that of the HC. \n\n\n### IPS State Proportion Has Been Altered in SZ \n  \nBy inspecting state prevalence values in both groups ( ), we note that patients express the first two states almost half as much as normal subjects (6% vs. 11% for state 1, and 12% vs. 22% for state 2). Instead, patients would rather spend more time in state 5 or 7 (15% vs. 10% for state 5, and 12% vs. 9% for state 7). Importantly, the first two states are more globally connected than others (see  , the leading eigenvectors), while state 5 is most notable for anticoupling within CC and negative coupling of CC to DMN and CB. State 7 also reflects de/anti-coupling among CC components. Corroborating these results, the persistence plot (in  ) shows that patients tend to remain in state 5 about 1.2 s longer than healthy subjects, on average; conversely, SZ patients cannot hold state 2 as long as the HC (persistence of state 2 = 7.5 s and 10 s, for SZ and HC, respectively). These differences were significant after FDR correction and show that the proportion and average duration of IPS states have been altered in SZ. Notably, this alteration favors less synchronous states that lack a cohesive cognitive control network. \n  \nCharacterization of transience in IPS states.   (A)   State prevalence (i.e., probability of occurrence) for each state, in the healthy control (HC) and schizophrenic (SZ) group. Error bars denote standard errors of mean (SEM). Group differences were assessed using permutation-based   t   tests. States 1 and 2 are more frequently visited by the HC, whereas states 5 and 7 are more prevalent in the patient group.   (B)   Persistence (i.e., mean lifetime) of each state, per group. The HC remain longer (continuously) in state 2, whereas SZ subjects prefer to linger in state 5.   (C)   Group-average transition patterns and their difference (HC–SZ). Diagonal values have been removed to improve image contrast. Only one entry (i.e., the probability of dwell in state 2) is significantly different after FDR correction.   (D)   Relationship between transition probability and state similarity. State similarity is assessed from four aspects: IPS pattern similarity, activity map similarity, prevalence similarity, and persistence similarity. Activity map resemblance is uncorrelated with transition probability between states; however, similarity in the other three functional and temporal aspects of the states significantly correlates with the probability of switching between them. The correlation coefficient (  r  ) is imprinted beside each plot, and red lines denote best fitted lines. In panels   (A,B)  , asterisks show statistically significant differences, after FDR correction (  indicates   p   < 0.05;   indicates   p   < 0.001). \n  \nIn addition to these state occupation features, the switching pattern between states is another informative aspect of IPS transience, which we will examine in the next section. \n\n\n### IPS State Transitions Show Minimal Change in SZ \n  \nIn  , we have shown group-specific transition matrices and their difference (HC–SZ). Although permutation tests on the transition probabilities returned a few significant uncorrected   p  -values (for transitions from/into states 2 and 5), none of them survived FDR correction, except the probability of dwell in state 2 (  q   < 0.05. This probability is on average 0.7 for the HC group and 0.6 for SZ patients. This result is in line with our previous finding that state 2 is almost twice as prevalent in healthy subjects (compared to the patients) and persists longer ( ). \n\nAlthough the transition probabilities are not very informative for distinguishing patients from controls (in the present study), they still reveal important information about the spontaneous spatiotemporal reorganization of the brain, in general. We will demonstrate this in the following. \n\n\n### State Transition Probability Correlates With State Similarity \n  \nPrevious research has suggested that the transition probability between connectivity modes correlates with the similarity of the corresponding connectivity patterns; that is, connectivity changes occur rather gradually over time ( ). However, the recurrent functional states in   reflect correlations. We tested the same hypothesis about fMRI instantaneous phase coupling variations. That is, we correlated the transition probabilities with the IPS state similarities. Notably, we assessed similarity of the states from both functional and temporal aspects. \n\nTo quantify functional similarity of the states, pairwise correlations were computed between the eight IPS states, over all subjects, resulting in an 8×8 symmetric state similarity matrix. Correspondence of this similarity matrix to the average transition matrix was quantified using correlation analysis. The same procedure was repeated using prevalence similarity, persistence similarity, and activity similarity of the states. \n\nThe results (in  ) show that, indeed, similar states are more likely to follow each other in time. Phase synchrony resemblance of the states significantly correlates with the transition probabilities [  r   = 0.45,   p  -value = 0.017, 95% CI = [0.31, 0.57]). The temporal similarity of the states, namely, their prevalence and persistence associations, are also linearly related to their transitional behavior. Specifically, for prevalence similarity vs. transition probability:   r   = 0.56,   p   = 0.0018, 95% CI = [0.47, 0.71]; and for persistence similarity against transition probability:   r   = 0.50,   p   = 0.0065, 95% CI = [0.45, 0.72]. However, activity pattern resemblance is not correlated with transition probability (  r   = 0.073,   p   = 0.71, 95% CI = [−0.25, 0.46]), corroborating the results in  . In other words, it is the connectivity (be it amplitude dependencies or phase coupling) structure that evolves with more self-consistence over time – rather than the activity profile. \n\nAs noted, the transition matrix holds abundant information about the spatiotemporal organization of the brain at rest. In the next section, we will go through the results of our metastate analysis – again based on the transition pattern – which speaks to higher-order temporal structure in the phase coupling variations. \n\n\n### Metastates Induce Two Distinct Phase Synchrony Modes \n  \nTo identify metastates (MS), we treated the average transition pattern as an adjacency matrix and bi-partitioned the associated graph using the Fiedler vector (as elaborated in the “Methods” section).   (right panel) shows the Fiedler vector alongside the hierarchical clustering dendrogram. Both approaches show that states 1–4 and 5–8 constitute two plausible partitions, i.e., metastates. The blocks on the main diagonal of the transition matrix ( , left panel) show that within-metastate transitions are more probable, than across. For the sake of presentation, each entry of this matrix denotes 0.6th quantile of the corresponding transition probabilities, across subjects. \n  \nIdentifying and characterizing metastates (MS).   (A)   Metastates are groups of states with higher probability of within-group transitions, than across. States 1–4 and 5–8 show this property, as evidenced by diagonal blocks on the group transition matrix. Entries of the transition matrix (left panel) denote 0.6th quantiles, across subjects. The top right panel shows the Fiedler vector (i.e., the second smallest eigenvector of the graph Laplacian associated with the transition matrix) and the lower panel contains the dendrogram of hierarchical clustering (cophenetic correlation coefficient = 0.22). Both methods acknowledge the same metastates.   (B)   Average metastate patterns, across subjects. MS1 is clearly more coherent (than MS2) and MS2 is notable for anticoupling of the cognitive control network components.   (C)   Difference in the phase coupling pattern of the metastates. Left panel: connections that are on average stronger in MS1 (or MS2) were identified using permutation-based paired   t   tests. Positive (pink) bars show (average) phase couplings that are significantly higher in MS1 than MS2; negative (blue) bars denote the inverse. The two connectograms (middle panel) convey the same information graphically. The bar plot (on the right) shows that average phase coupling is significantly higher in MS1, than MS2 (permutation-based paired   t   test:   p   < 1e–4). Error bars stand for standard errors of mean, and >*⁣** indicates   p   < 1e–4. \n  \nThe average MS profiles are illustrated in  . MS1 is clearly more coherent, and both SC and AUD networks have central roles in its functional architecture. Conversely, MS2 has lower overall phase synchrony level ( , bar plot) and shows a notable breakup and anticoupling among CC components. We tested for connectomic differences between these MSs using permutation-based paired   t   tests. The results in   show that out of ( ) 28 unique connections within and across the main (seven) networks, 21 couplings are on average stronger in MS1, only 2 connection means are higher in MS2, while 5 connections are not significantly different (after FDR correction). The connectograms in   show the mean values for the statistically different connections in the two MSs. Moreover, the bar plot (right panel) demonstrates that global phase coupling of MS1 is significantly higher than MS2 (  p  -value < 1e−4). Having characterized the metastates, the outstanding task is to verify whether the temporal organization of these MSs has been altered in SZ. \n\n\n### The Less-Synchronous Metastate Dominates in SZ \n  \nWe quantified the temporal profile of the metastates by computing their transition probabilities, as well as their prevalence and persistence values, in each group.   shows that the probability of dwell in MS1 is higher in HC compared to SZ (0.85 versus 0.81,   p  -value < 1e−3). Conversely, the probability of dwell in MS2 is higher in SZ than HC (0.84 versus 0.80). Transition probabilities (from MS1 to MS2 and vice versa) are the complements of dwell values, so they are also significantly different between the two groups. Moreover, the dwell probabilities are significantly different   within   each group; that is, MS1 dwell is higher than MS2 dwell in HC subjects (  p   < 1e−3), and the opposite is true for SZ patients (  p   = 0.0162). All   p  -values were FDR corrected. These results become clearer as we inspect other temporal characteristics of the metastates. \n  \nTemporal characteristics of metastates (MS).   (A)   Average transition probability matrices of metastates, for the healthy control (HC, left panel) and schizophrenic (SZ, right panel) subjects. Dwell probabilities (i.e., the diagonal entries) were compared within and between groups.   (B)   Difference in the prevalence (i.e., probability of occurrence) of MS1 and MS2, within and across groups.   (C)   Difference in the persistence (i.e., uninterrupted occupancy) of metastates, within and across groups. The key finding here is that MS1 is dominant in the HC, whereas MS2 prevails in SZ. Statistical tests were permutation-based   t   tests (paired, when appropriate). Error bars denote standard errors of mean (SEM). Asterisks denote significant difference in mean, after FDR correction (  indicates   p   < 0.05;   indicates   p   < 0.01;   indicates   p   < 0.001; > *⁣** indicates   p   < 0.0001). \n  \n show that MS1 is more prevalent and persists longer in the HC, compared to the SZ group (compare the pink bars); the inverse is true for MS2 (inspect the blue bars). All FDR-corrected   p  -values remained below 0.001 for these tests. But, more importantly, this plot is saying that the balance of MS expression for a typical SZ patient is the inverse of what is expected in a normal subject. That is, while MS1 is dominant in the HC (both in terms of prevalence and persistence), MS2 is the leading phase coupling mode in SZ. These within-group effects were investigated using paired (permutation-based)   t   tests . Comparing MS ratio between the groups showed that both persistence ratio and prevalence ratio (computed as MS2/MS1) are significantly higher in SZ (  p  -values < 1e−4; Cohen’s   d   = 0.86 and 0.85). \n\nIn short, although immediate IPS transition probabilities seem to be minimally changed in SZ ( ), deep temporal organization of the states has been gravely altered in the patient group. Notably, this altered balance is such that patients spend more time in a poorly connected MS (i.e., MS2), which promotes phase decoupling within and across most functional networks – and anticoupling within the cognitive control network. Overall, this metastate analysis suggests that large-scale functional disconnection in SZ could be mediated by distortions in the deep temporal structure of IPS connectivity modes, at the network level. \n\nThis concludes our cluster-based analysis. In the next section, we will see the results of our cluster-free approach to IPS assessment, using the trajectory of instantaneous phase couplings. We will inspect whether phase synchrony evolution has been modulated in SZ. \n\n\n### Phase Coupling Trajectory Is Less Efficient and Less Smooth in the Patient Group \n  \nIn this section, we report the results of IPS trajectory characterization. We mentioned that collapsing IPS patterns onto one dimension (i.e., state labels) is a simplification that overlooks potentially useful information in the sample-to-sample connectomic changes ( ). Hence, we used L1 distance to assess dissimilarity between time-indexed IPS matrices, and defined a number of measures to characterize the hyperspace and pathway traversed during each session. These measures are summarized in  , and their empirical values are presented in  . \n  \nTrajectory analysis results. \n    \nThe results show that the average   trajectory length   is higher in SZ (compared to HC), but the difference is weakly significant (  p   = 0.096). However, all the other indices have significantly higher means in the HC group. Namely, the   span  ,   capacity  ,   efficiency  , and   smoothness   of the trajectory are all higher in normal subjects (FDR corrected   p  -values = 0.023, 0.002, 0.032, and 0.024, respectively). These results speak to the modulation of ongoing phase coupling in SZ, at the network level. This modulation is such that consecutive patterns are more dissimilar in the patient brain (hence the reduced smoothness), but this jumpy trajectory fails to achieve the more diverse repertoire of IPS patterns that is realized by the typical healthy brain. \n\n shows representative IPS trajectories from a normal subject (22-year-old male) and a SZ patient (33-year-old male), projected on the first two principal components of their IPS profiles. Hence, each circle (or cross) is a time-indexed IPS pattern presented on a low-dimensional manifold and the connecting lines show the progression of IPS from time to time. Even visual inspection confirms that the HC trajectory smoothly explores a larger space (left panel) as opposed to the patient trajectory (right panel) which seems to be confined in the top right corner of the space most of the time. The corresponding state sequences (lower panels) show that the normal subject spends longer periods in state 2 and 4 (which belong to MS1). Conversely, the patient sequence mostly avoids states 1 and 2, but visits states 5–8 more often (which are associated with MS2). \n  \nSample IPS trajectories from a healthy control subject (HC, left panel) and a schizophrenia patient (SZ, right panel). Top panels: IPS trajectories in low-dimensional manifolds (spanned by the first two principal components, PC). Notably, the HC subject covers a larger space and realizes a smoother trajectory (compared to the patient). Lower panels illustrate the corresponding state sequences. The healthy subject spends longer periods in states 2 and 4 (which belong to metastate 1), while the patient’s sequence mostly avoids states 1 and 2, but visits states 5–8 more often (which are associated with metastate 2). Please refer to   for group differences in IPS trajectory measures. \n  \nEquipped with IPS measures derived from our state, metastate, and trajectory analyses, we will now look into the explanatory power of these phase indices for predicting SZ in a regression model. \n\n\n### IPS Measures Predict SZ \n  \nA linear regression model was used to assess the predictive power of different IPS measures for SZ diagnosis, while treating age, gender, and MFD as confounds. The adjusted   values (i.e., explained variances) have been reported in  , alongside the regression coefficients and FDR corrected   p  -values (of the   F   tests). \n  \nDiagnostic value of IPS measures for schizophrenia (SZ). A linear regression model (Eq. 7) was set up for each measure, while treating age, gender, and mean framewise displacement (MFD) as confounds. Bars denote adjusted   R   values (i.e., explained variances). Numbers on the right show regression coefficients (β ) and FDR-corrected   p  -values (  q  ) of   F   tests conducted on regression models. The measures have been grouped into three categories: state-related measures, metastate-based measures, and trajectory measures. For definition of the measures, please refer to  . S: State; MS: Metastate. \n  \nAmong the included states, state 2 features (namely, its prevalence, persistence, and dwell) are the better predictors (adjusted   R   = 0.10). Notably, all the MS indices (i.e., MS prevalence, persistence, dwell, and MS2/MS1 ratio) have adjusted   R   above 0.12, while MS2/MS1 persistence ratio alone can explain 19% of the variance in diagnosis label. As such, metastates seem to be distinctive features. In fact, previous correlation-based DFC research has shown that metastate profile is heritable, subject-specific, and related to behavioral traits ( ). Among the trajectory measures, capacity seems the most distinctive, with adjusted   R   = 0.10. These results are particularly useful for selecting IPS features for classification studies. \n\n\n### IPS States Are Distinct From Random Phase Synchrony Patterns \n  \n shows IPS states derived from clustering surrogate data, alongside empirical states. Surrogate1 was generated by phase shuffling the original series and surrogate2 was produced by inducing random circular shifts in the original data. For surrogate data, the cluster validity index (i.e., Davies–Bouldin index, panel C) continues to decrease by increasing model complexity, as opposed to the empirical plot (in panel B) that endorses eight clusters. Subsequent inspection of surrogate centroids (assuming   k   = 8 clusters) revealed that the resultant states are indistinguishable and lack the strong (anti)coupling structure in the empirical arrangements. Furthermore, we depicted group-specific states to highlight the correspondence of IPS modes in the two groups, although SZ patterns (especially states 1 and 2) are somewhat fainter. \n  \nEmpirical versus surrogate IPS states. Panel   (A)   plots show that clustering IPS patterns from surrogate data do not result in the same well-defined and distinct states identified in empirical data. The first column (left) shows the empirical states (same as  ). The second and third columns reflect the high correspondence of IPS states in the two (HC and SZ) groups. Percentage values denote the prevalence of each IPS mode. Conversely, the patterns in the last two columns (on the far right) were derived from surrogate data. Surrogate1 was generated by phase shuffling the original series and surrogate2 was produced by inducing random circular shifts in the original time courses. Surrogate data were subjected to the same clustering procedure as empirical data. The cluster validity plot for surrogate data [in panel   (C)  ] shows that the Davies–Bouldin validity index continues to decrease by increasing model complexity (i.e., the cluster number). This is in contrast to the trend observed in real data [panel   (B)   here, same as  ], which endorses an optimal model size of 8. The surrogate states depicted in panel   (A)   show the clustering solution for   k   = 8, for the sake of comparison with empirical modes. The resultant surrogate states are flat and lack the strong coupling and anticoupling structure in the original states. Healthy Control: HC; Schizophrenic: SZ. \n  \nIn short, we see that empirical IPS modes are well-defined, diverse, and distinct from random phase synchrony patterns. In other words, IPS states seem to reflect intrinsic order in the phase synchronization of functional networks, which further corroborates the idea that resting-state dynamics may be conceptualized as excursion though a bounded repertoire of metastable functional modes ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Phase Synchrony States Are Not Driven by Head Motion \n  \nCorrelation analysis showed that FD does not meaningfully covary with the occurrence of any state:   r   = 0.0323, 0.0198, 0.0023, −0.0286, 0.008, −0.0190, 0.0029, and −0.0141, for states 1–8, respectively. Moreover, the effect of state label on mean FD was insignificant [repeated-measures ANOVA:   F   (7,693) = 1.12,   p   = 0.35]. Hence, none of the states is associated with head movement, and the evidence does not support difference in the associated motion of the states. \n\nTo verify the potential relation of the states to wakefulness, we inspected state occurrence rates over time. It turned out that only the best fitted line to state 4 incidence rate has a significantly non-zero (positive) trend. The uncorrected   p  -values (of one-sample   t   tests on the line slopes, across subjects) were 0.66, 0.69, 0.13,   0.034  , 0.91, 0.76, 0.12, and 0.35, for the eight states, respectively. The actual state occurrences have been depicted in  , for all subjects (in the upper surface plots). In each lower plot, state occurrence has been accumulated over subjects per time point; hence, the superimposed fitted lines show group trends. Specifically, the group trend for state 4 reflects 3.9% increase in the appearance of this state, per time sample. Notably, state 4 was not different in prevalence or persistence between HC and SZ subjects (see  ). \n  \nDrowsiness effect. The occurrence of each state (over time) has been depicted for each subject. The two groups (HC and SZ) have been separated by a constant (white) line, in the surface plots. Other white patches indicate the emergence of that particular state over time. In the lower bar plots, state occurrences have been accumulated over subjects, for each time point. The black fitted lines show group trends. Group trend for state 4 reveals a 3.9% increase in the expression of this state, per time sample. Only state 4 has a significantly non-zero (positive) trend (  p  -value = 0.034). \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nToday, resting-state DFC features are being rigorously examined as potential functional biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of brain disorders. The ease of task-free data acquisition (especially from patients) makes resting-state studies particularly appealing. Besides, recent evidence suggests that resting-state DFC can affect task performance and may explain inter-subject differences in perception, learning, and other cognitive abilities ( ). Among DFC measures, fMRI IPS has the advantage of evading the window problem ( ;  ;  ) and its functional relevance has been revealed in health, disease, and pharmacological conditions ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In the present study, we extended IPS characterization to higher functional and temporal scales, and addressed an important analysis issue – that of finding natural order in this type of data. In the following, we will review the key contributions of this work and the significance of the findings. \n\nWe showed that the inherent spatiotemporal order in IPS data can be uncovered (using spectral clustering) without compromising the phase coupling details. Importantly, this approach improves interpretability of the identified states. For instance, state 5 (which is more prevalent in SZ patients) shows clear anticoupling between CC and CB networks (see  ). In fact, fronto-cerebellar dissociation in SZ has been commonly reported and relates to negative and cognitive symptoms, as well as executive dysfunction in SZ ( ;  ). Moreover, cluster analysis revealed a globally coherent state (i.e., state 1), which has been reported in prior IPS research as well. Specifically,   showed that this highly synchronous state is visited less often in older adults with poor cognitive scores. Similarly,   showed that the occurrence of a very synchronous state decreases after psilocybin injection. We found that state 1 is significantly less frequent in the SZ group, alongside state 2. As for state 2, it reflects strong interactions of SC and AUD with other networks. Functional (and structural) alterations of the subcortical network in SZ and their relationship with social and cognitive performance have been extensively studied in the literature ( ). It has even been suggested that reduced fronto-subcortical FC could be a functional biomarker of SZ ( ). As such, preserving the details of IPS patterns is quite informative and can reveal useful functional features (e.g., for diagnostic purposes). \n\nAnother important aspect of our research was focusing on IPS analysis at the network level (rather than regional), with a whole-brain scope, which speaks to higher-order functional integration in the brain. Notably, transient interaction of large-scale networks is a functional attribute that relates to personality traits ( ,  ) and shows alterations in prior DFC accounts of SZ ( ;  ;  ). We used constrained ICA and verified (section “Subject-Specificity of Networks”) that this approach respects subject specificity of the estimated networks and simultaneously maintains network correspondence at the group level. Moreover, the fine-grained functional parcellation (with 50 ICs) was useful for inspection of sub-network behavior. For instance, we notice that four states reflect anticoupling among CC sub-components (i.e., states 4–7). Remarkably, three of these states belong to metastate 2, which is significantly predominant in SZ ( ). This phase coupling alteration in the CC network of the patients might be related to cognitive deficits in SZ and supports previous reports of dysfunctional CC connections ( ;  ). Hence, including sub-components of the networks is valuable in that it provides more insight into the functional organization of the states. \n\nA further product of our analysis was uncovering the relationship between transition probability and IPS state similarity. Specifically, we showed that similar states (in terms of functional pattern and temporal profile) are more likely to switch into each other ( ). This is the same phenomenon reported in   – about gradual connectivity progression at rest – despite the fact that our connectivity states reflect phase synchrony modes and their states reflect correlations. Hence, the tendency to explore local neighborhoods in the (functional and temporal) feature space of metastable connectivity structures seems to be a fundamental aspect of spatiotemporal reorganization of the brain, at rest . \n\nSubsequently, we looked for deeper (slower) temporal order in the IPS transience. This analysis disclosed higher-level temporal organization of phase synchrony modes and the utility of metastate analysis. This hierarchical temporal arrangement seems to be another fundamental DFC trait that does not depend on the (correlation or phase based) nature of the connectivity states ( ). Moreover, metastate analysis turned out particularly useful in our clinical application. That is because patients and HCs do not differ much in their immediate transition profiles ( ); however, we noticed that MS balance has been gravely altered in SZ ( ). In other words, it is the slower clock (which determines metastate occupation) that seems to be damaged in the SZ disorder. Importantly, metastate proportion turned out to be a strong predictor of SZ, in the regression analysis ( ). Additionally, MS characterization showed that MS2 (which prevails in SZ) is significantly less coherent than MS1 ( ). Overall, we showed that SZ connectivity disorder is manifest on higher functional (i.e., network) and temporal (i.e., metastate) levels as well. \n\nAfter state and metastate characterization, we focused on the trajectory of IPS evolution, free from the restrictions of cluster analysis. We defined novel measures ( ) to quantify different trajectory attributes. The results (in  ) showed that, despite the relatively large sample-to-sample jumps in SZ, the inefficient IPS trajectory of the patient brain precludes realization of a rich repertoire of FC patterns, compared to HC subjects. Hence, all four measures of span, capacity, efficiency, and smoothness were significantly lower in the patient group. Relevant research ( ) has characterized the trajectory of (correlation-based) DFC patterns in SZ and showed that patient trajectories cover a smaller portion of the state space and realize fewer distinct patterns. These results seem also in line with the findings in  , which indicate that cognitive performance is directly related to the   variety   of network configurations explored at rest. This makes more sense when we remember that cognitive deficits are among the core symptoms of SZ ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nDespite partial consistency of our findings with those in   – about the reduced span of DFC space in SZ – IPS analysis shows that the connectivity trajectory length is actually longer in SZ, unlike the correlation-based result in  . A key difference is that we have followed the connectomic path in a higher dimensional space, and that IPS has inherently higher temporal resolution. This longer trajectory in SZ, alongside shorter span, results in the lower efficiency of FC evolution ( ), suggesting less structured navigation of the state space in SZ. Moreover, the recurrent inter-network IPS modes identified by our analysis do not resemble the complex-valued states (based on wavelet coherence) in  ,   or the correlation-based states in  , even though the same network parcellations were adopted in our studies . This speaks to a well-defined identity for the IPS repertoire, beyond correlation-based  DFC states. This disparity is due to the different mathematical properties of IPS and sliding-window correlations ( ). \n\nLastly, we investigated the diagnostic value of IPS measures, using regression analysis. The metastates turned out to be distinctive traits for SZ identification, together with the prevalence of state 2 and the capacity of the trajectory. There is hope that, developing neuroimaging-based biomarkers and (machine learning based) classifiers would facilitate more objective diagnosis of patient (sub)groups, to furnish more effective treatment selection and prognosis ( ;  ;  ). Along this way, FC-based methods can provide useful (statistical) insight into the pathological alterations of brain connectivity, at the observation level; however, characterizing the underlying neuronal circuitry and revealing the mechanisms of functional integration would call for model-based (effective connectivity) approaches ( ,  ;  ), which are recently being integrated with machine learning techniques as well ( ). \n\nTo elucidate the long-term vision, we mention a couple of recent achievements. Lately,   have used a data-driven approach to show that connectivity breakdown between the cerebellum (CB) and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) directly corresponds to the severity of negative symptoms in SZ, which are known to be resistant to medication. Notably, when these researchers applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the cerebellar midline of SZ patients and restored this specific CB-DLPFC functional connection, the negative symptoms were also relieved – reflecting a causal relationship that is useful for therapeutic purposes. In another prominent research,   have proposed a generative whole-brain model that can predict (  in silico  ) how direct electrical stimulation of different brain regions would change the   proportion   of IPS states in the brain (of the sort depicted in our prevalence plot, in  ). As a proof of concept, the authors showed that this method can be used to “awaken” the brain from deep sleep to wakefulness and vice versa, i.e., switching between two conditions that entail different state proportions. Accordingly, 1 day we may be able to modulate disease-specific circuitry and restore state (or metastate) balance in brain disorders – such as SZ – which might relieve the clinical symptoms and eventually improve the quality of life for these patients. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe data analyzed in this study was obtained from the COllaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Data Exchange tool (COINS;  ).

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) represents 20% of the neurodegenerative forms of dementia. Fluctuations of cognition and vigilance are the key symptoms of DLB. To date, no dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) investigations of this disorder have been performed. In this paper, we refer to the concept of connectivity state as a piecewise stationary configuration of functional connectivity between brain networks. From this concept, we propose a new method for group-level as well as for subject-level studies to compare and characterize connectivity state changes between a set of resting-state networks (RSNs). Dynamic Bayesian networks, statistical and graph theory-based models, enable one to learn dependencies between interacting state-based processes. Product hidden Markov models (PHMM), an instance of dynamic Bayesian networks, are introduced here to capture both statistical and temporal aspects of DFC of a set of RSNs. This analysis was based on sliding-window cross-correlations between seven RSNs extracted from a group independent component analysis performed on 20 healthy elderly subjects and 16 patients with DLB. Statistical models of DFC differed in patients compared to healthy subjects for the occipito-parieto-frontal network, the medial occipital network and the right fronto-parietal network. In addition, pairwise comparisons of DFC of RSNs revealed a decrease of dependency between these two visual networks (occipito-parieto-frontal and medial occipital networks) and the right fronto-parietal control network. The analysis of DFC state changes thus pointed out networks related to the cognitive functions that are known to be impaired in DLB: visual processing as well as attentional and executive functions. Besides this context, product HMM applied to RSNs cross-correlations offers a promising new approach to investigate structural and temporal aspects of brain DFC. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nBrain functional connectivity studies in resting-state functional MRI provide functional networks that correspond to spontaneously co-activated cerebral regions, also named resting-state networks (RSNs) when shared by a population. So far, interactions between brain areas have been described under the assumption of temporal stationarity of functional connectivity, producing a static description of those interactions. Recently, dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) investigations demonstrated that cerebral regions do not interact in a static way, but rather in a dynamic process that could change over time (Hutchison et al.,  ; Calhoun et al.,  ). These variations have been particularly highlighted by Chang and Glover ( ) with a time-frequency analysis that allows to investigate dynamic proofs in functional connectivity signal at different time scales. To go further in this new growing field of research, the studies are nowadays directed toward the concept of neural connectivity state, along with the possibility of reproducible patterns of DFC. Several methods have been developed to assess interactions between cerebral regions or networks mainly based on a sliding windows approach used with correlation (Leonardi et al.,  ; Allen et al.,  ) and spatial (Kiviniemi et al.,  ) or temporal (Smith et al.,  ) independent component analysis. But there is no consensus on the definition of “connectivity state,” and tools to measure and quantify this dynamics are still to be developed. \n\nWhen considering the dialectic used in DFC analysis (“dynamic,” “brain state,” “graph,” “network,” etc.), it seems natural to think about methodological tools such as dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN), or instances of DBN such as hidden Markov models (HMM), or product HMM (PHMM), to capture temporal dependencies between RSN. Markov models (not “hidden” Markov models) have already been used in DFC analysis, but not as a primary tool, to point out different connectivity states from sliding-windows correlations on time-series of defined brain regions (Allen et al.,  ; Ma et al.,  ). To date, very few studies have used dynamic Bayesian networks, HMM, or product HMM to investigate DFC in resting-state fMRI (Eavani et al.,  ; Ou et al.,  ). For an exploratory purpose, Eavani et al. ( ) proposed a method to highlight, at subject level, the variability of functional connectivity. Applied on clustering covariance matrices from defined regions of interest, the HMM approach they proposed was able to decode DFC into temporal sequences of hidden states, each state associated with a distinct connectivity pattern. The authors introduced their algorithm with two to ten connectivity states allowing them to distinguish different brain patterns. Ou et al. ( ) used HMM on a large scale functional connectivity matrix to distinguish children with an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder from control children. With multiple initialization parameters, their method led to 15 to 25 hidden connectivity states that well described the two studied groups. In order to be computational, the cited methods introduced data reduction techniques to cope with the high dimension of fMRI data. Then, the number of states is usually limited either by the number of cerebral regions to include in the connectivity study, or by a clustering of functional connectivity regions performed prior to the Markov model analysis (Eavani et al.,  ; Allen et al.,  ; Ma et al.,  ). \n\nThe number of cerebral regions or RSNs to observe and thus the number of possible interactions are very numerous in DFC studies. This remark should be especially taken into consideration as fMRI studies provide a limited number of observations, making the robustness more difficult to ensure. To solve this problem, the methods mentioned above rely on a data reduction step. Connectivity states are defined by clustering according to what was observed during a first step of DFC analysis. This strategy leads to a small number of states and allows one to focus exclusively on the observed data. The states, defined in a group of subjects, represent spatial patterns of connectivity between RSNs that appear in a reproducible manner in time and/or across subjects. The dynamics between these states is thereafter modeled by a Markov chain. This procedure is assumed to sufficiently take into account, in the reduction and in the Markov modeling, spatial and temporal interactions between RSNs. However, this approach, although closer to the data, does not allow one to observe the states that are more ephemeral or less representative of the DFC of a group of subject. An alternative approach consists in defining the connectivity states, directly from the states in each RSN, without knowledge of which interactions will appear in the observed sequence. In this way, the complexity of these RSN interactions is transferred into a multi-dimensional modeling as proposed by product HMM. These states represent all the possibilities of interactions between the RSNs and are defined as the Cartesian product of the states sub-spaces in each process. Thereafter, the DFC is modeled by the product HMM. This large state space allowed by this multi-dimensional approach enables a better consideration of dynamic aspects without requiring a reduction of upstream data. \n\nWithin the product HMM framework, this paper compares brain DFC between patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and healthy elderly controls. DLB is the second most prevalent form of neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease, affecting from 16 to 20% of patients with dementia (Aarsland et al.,  ). The main clinical criteria of DLB are cognitive impairment together with fluctuating cognition, parkinsonism and visual hallucination. To better understand brain abnormalities in DLB, numerous MRI studies have been performed but very few assessed resting-state functional connectivity, and only in a perspective of spatial analysis (Lowther et al.,  ; Peraza et al.,  ). Indeed, none of them focused on network time-courses or on interactions between networks. Yet, these are particularly relevant in DLB as cognitive fluctuations and hallucinations suggest that functional brain abnormalities in DLB may be transient. For computational concerns, and considering the number of volumes acquired per subject, we focused on seven specific RSNs exhibited during the resting-state fMRI session. They were chosen according to their relevance with respect to the disease, which is characterized by dysexecutive/attentional disorders (Ferman et al.,  ,  ; Johns et al.,  ; Yoon et al.,  ), and visual (Ferman et al.,  ,  ) and motor (McKeith et al.,  ) impairments:\n   \n- DMN (default mode network): self-oriented cognition, \n  \n- LFPN (left fronto-Parietal network): executive control, \n  \n- RFPN (right fronto-Parietal network): executive orientation of attention, \n  \n- OPFN (occipito-parieto-frontal network): visuo-oculomotor pathway, visuo-attentional and visuo-constructive processing, \n  \n- OPN (occipital posterior network): visual processing, \n  \n- MON (medial occipital network): visual processing, \n  \n- BG (basal ganglia): motor processing. \n  \n\nIn assessing brain dynamic functional connectivity in DLB based on product HMM, our purpose is double: (1) to differentiate DLB patients from healthy elderly controls from their DFC analyses, and (2) to provide new analysis tools to explore DFC and characterize interactions between RSNs. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and methods \n  \n### 2.1. Data \n  \n#### 2.1.1. Participants \n  \nForty-four participants were recruited for this study from the Memory Resources and Research Center of the University Hospital of Strasbourg, France. Six participants were excluded due to excessive motion during the fMRI acquisition i.e., translation and rotation respectively higher than 2 mm or 2 degrees, according to the motion parameter resulting from SPM) and two participants were excluded due to neurological abnormalities. Therefore, groups consisted in 16 patients with DLB at the stage of mild dementia [8 females; mean age, 74.7 (range: 54–89) years] and 20 healthy elderly controls [11 females; mean age, 64.4 (range: 46–76) years]. All patients had formal assessment of their diagnosis by three independent expert clinicians. Controls underwent similar clinical, cognitive, psychiatric and neurological assessments to exclude any that may have had occult cognitive impairments. All patients satisfied McKeith's criteria for probable DLB i.e., at least two core symptoms out of three (McKeith et al.,  ). No patients shared both DLB and Alzheimer's disease clinical features. The MMSE (Mini Mental State Examination) scores (Folstein et al.,  ), as a cognitive functions scale, were 20.8 (std: 3.2; range 15–24) and 29.0 (std: 1.0; range 27–30) respectively, for patients and controls. Exclusion criteria included contraindications for MRI, history of alcohol/substance misuse, evidence suggesting alternative neurological or psychiatric explanations for their symptoms, focal brain lesions on brain imaging, and the presence of other severe or unstable medical illness. This study was approved by the local Ethics Committee (Comité de Protections des Personnes Est IV, Strasbourg, France). Controls and patients gave written informed consent. Patients were older than controls (two-sample   t  -test,   p   < 0.01), but did not differ in terms of gender (chi-squared tests at   p   < 0.05) (see Table   for details on the database). \n\n\n#### 2.1.2. Data acquisition \n  \nA concomitant resting-state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and pulsed arterial-spin labeling (ASL) sequence was performed on a Siemens Verio 3T scanner equipped with a 32-channel head coil (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). One-hundred twenty-one whole brain T2 -weighted (gradient echo) echo planar images were acquired using the QUIPPS II sequence provided by the manufacturer. Parameters were: TR = 3 s; flip angle = 90; TE = 21 ms; TI1 = 600 ms, TI2 = 1325.1 ms; FOV = 152 × 256 × 112 mm; imaging matrix: 38 × 64 × 28; 4 mm isotropic voxels, acceleration factor (generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions). The first volume served for ASL assessment and was therefore not considered for functional connectivity. A 3D MPRAGE T1-weighted image was also acquired at the same session. Parameters were: imaging matrix 192 × 192 × 176; 1 mm isotropic voxels. \n\n\n\n### 2.2. Theory: Product HMM \n  \nA product HMM λ is a standard HMM built upon a set {λ } of HMM, by taking into account their temporal interdependencies (Nefian et al.,  ). First, as a reminder, it should be noted that an HMM λ  is a double stochastic process (  X  ,   Y  ) where   is a hidden Markov chain observed through the observation sequence   of length   T  .   means that λ  is in state   i   at time   t  .   S   = {  i  } is the state space of   X  . The product HMM λ built upon {λ }, 1 ≤   k   ≤   K  , is a double stochastic process (  X  ,   Y  ) in which state space   S   is by definition the Cartesian product of the   S  , hence the term product HMM:\n \n\n X   = (  X  , ⋯ ,   X  ) is a hidden Markov chain where   denotes the state vector at   t  .   X   =   i   means that λ is in state   i   = (  i  , ⋯ ,   i  , ⋯ ,   i  ),   i   ∈   S  .   Y   = (  Y  , ⋯ ,   Y  ) is the observation sequence of λ where   is obtained through the concatenation of the observations  . The parameters of a product HMM λ are:\n \n\nΠ = {π ,   i   ∈   S  }, is the set of initial probabilities where π  denotes the probability to be in state   i   at time   t   = 1. The transition matrix   A   = {  a  ,   i  ,   j   ∈   S  }, reflects the temporal dependencies between the   K   hidden Markov chains. It probabilistically models their joint state evolution in time.   B   = {  b  (·),   j   ∈   S  }, is the set of observation probabilities associated with states   j  . In practice, the conditional independence of   given   is assumed, in Equation (4), so as:\n \n\nThe dynamic Bayesian network representation of a product HMM is shown Figure  . \n  \n Representation of a product HMM as a dynamic Bayesian network  . The transparent circles represent the hidden variables  . The shaded circles represent the observations  . The rectangular boxes and their conditional dependencies represented by arrows depict the DBN representation of a standard HMM. \n  \nAs a standard HMM, a product HMM preserves the algorithmic aspects of an HMM related to the evaluation, learning and decoding procedures (Rabiner,  ; Nefian et al.,  ). The likelihood   P  (  Y  |λ) can be calculated to assess how well the model fits the observed data and vice versa (  evaluation  ). The product HMM parameter set θ = {π ,   a  ,   b  (▪);   i  ,   j  ,   j   ∈   S  , 1 ≤   k   ≤   K  } can be learned by iteratively training the model λ(θ) to produce   Y   (  learning  ). The optimal,   K  -dimensional state sequence  , and the resulting   K   state sequences  , underlying   Y   can be inferred or decoded to lead to the “symbolic” state-based transcription of   Y   (  decoding  ). Finally, product HMM can be compared in pairs using the distance measure between two models λ  and λ , defined in Juang and Rabiner ( ) and Rabiner ( ) as:\n \nwhere   Y   is a sequence of observations generated by model λ . Equation (6) is a measure of how well λ  matches observations generated by λ , relative to how well λ  matches observations generated by itself. Several interpretations of Equation (6) exist in terms of cross entropy, divergence or discrimination information (Juang and Rabiner,  ). The symmetrized version of this measure is\n \n\nFurther details of product HMM can be found in Nefian et al. ( ). \n\n\n### 2.3. Product HMM for dynamic functional analysis of RSNs \n  \n#### 2.3.1. Data preprocessing and organization \n  \nAs the TE is high enough to make the BOLD sequence sensitive to ASL signals, data were low-pass filtered at 0.1125 Hz according to the method of Chuang et al. ( ) to remove ASL frequencies. After this filtering, each subject underwent the following preprocessing steps using the SPM8 toolbox (Statistical Parametric Mapping,  ): slice-timing correction; rigid body registration with correction of effects of B0 field inhomogeneities; coregistration to anatomical space; spatial normalization onto the MNI space with the DARTEL approach i.e., from the transformation parameters provided by the T1-weighted image normalization). \n\nA group-level spatial independent component analysis (ICA) was carried out using the GIFT toolbox (GIFT,  ) to extract the common RSNs of all the subjects (controls and patients included). We used 80 components for the subject-specific data reduction with principal components analysis (PCA) according to the automatic estimator available in GIFT, and 30 components for the group data reduction. The ICA with Infomax algorithm (Bell and Sejnowski,  ) was repeated 10 times using ICASSO (Himberg et al.,  ) to provide stable components. \n\nAccording to previous RSN templates from group ICA (Damoiseaux et al.,  ), two experts selected among the 30 components the ten that match a RSN. For computational concerns, and considering the number of volumes acquired by subject, we focused on seven specific RSNs (see Figure  ) described in Section 1: the default mode network, the left fronto-parietal network, the right fronto-parietal network, the occipito-parieto-frontal network, the occipital posterior network, the medial occipital network and the basal ganglia. These networks were relevant due to their possible implications in the DLB disorders, such as attention and executive functions (the fronto-parietal networks), visual processing (the occipital networks), parkinsonism (the basal ganglia network), or for being a major RSN (the default mode network). The three remaining RSNs consisted in a frontal network and two central networks (see Figure   for the spatial maps of the frontal network and a central network). \n  \n Spatial maps of the 7 studied RSNs from group-ICA expressed in z-score, plotted upon mean T1 from all subjects (patients and controls combined)  . (DMN, Default Mode Network; LFPN, Left Fronto-Parietal Network; RFPN, Right Fronto-Parietal Network; OPFN, Occipito-Parieto-Frontal Network; OPN, Occipital Posterior Network; MON, Medial Occipital Network; BG, Basal ganglia.) \n  \nFor each of these RSNs, a subject-specific spatial map and its associated time-course were back-reconstructed (Calhoun et al.,  ). It led to 7 × 16 = 112 time-courses for the patients group and 7 × 20 = 140 time-courses for the control group. \n\nThen, to reduce the parameters set θ to learn per model λ, RSN data of each subject were organized according to a “one RSN   vs  . the others” analysis strategy. For each RSN   n  , 1 ≤   n   ≤   N   = 7, a correlation coefficient plot CC  = {cc (  t  ); 1 ≤   m   ≤   N   = 7,   m   ≠   n  , 1 ≤   t   ≤   T  } was formed. It is composed of   K   =   N   − 1 = 6 time series cc (  t  ) of length   T   representing the evolution of the correlation coefficient for each pair of time-courses associated with RSN  and RSN . cc (  t  ) was calculated using a sliding tapered window made by convolving a Gaussian with a rectangle of 15 TR (45 s) and sliding in steps of 1 TR, leading to   T   = 103 windows. An example of CC  is shown at the top of Figure  , for   N   = 4 (  K   = 3) for clarity. \n  \n DFC modeling and analysis steps of a subject, for RSN   n   vs. the others with   N   = 4,   K   = 3 (see text)  .

(C)   Two examples of output results: decoded state sequence   (top), transition matrix Â estimated by learning (bottom). \n  \n\n#### 2.3.2. DFC modeling and analysis by product HMM \n  \nThe method was implemented with Matlab R2012b (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). The DFC modeling procedure is illustrated in Figure  . A model λ  is assigned to each CC , leading to 7 product HMM λ  per subject. The correlation coefficient plot CC  is considered as the observable process of λ , that is,   Y   ≡ CC .   is thus a   K   ×   T   matrix of observations with  . As described in Section 2.2, the product HMM λ  is built upon 6 HMM   with 1 ≤   k   ≤   K   = 6.   models the   k   correlation coefficient time series, or row, of   Y  . The state space   S   of   is composed of two states, the anticorrelation state “−1” and the correlation state “+1,” so that the state space of λ  is   S   = {“−1,” “+1”} , with Card(  S  ) = 2  = 64. The transition matrix   A   = {  a  ,   i  } and   j   in   S  , models the temporal dependencies between the correlation coefficient times series of   Y  . The matrix   A   of dimension 64 × 64, captures the overall dynamics of the CC . The conditional probability density functions (pdf)   b  (▪) model the distribution of   given the state  ,   j   ∈ {“−1”;“+1”}. These pdf are assumed to be unimodal Gaussians with means   and variances  , so as Equation (5) can be written as:\n \n\nAs described in Figure  , before learning, the parameters of the model λ  are initialized (θ = θ ). The initial probabilities of Equation (2) are set uniform, with  . Regarding to Equation (3), {  a  } have been set to   except for the diagonal terms {  a  } set to  . The means   and variances   were initialized directly from the data. For each channel   k  , we used the positive values of the correlation coefficients cc (  t  ) to calculate   and   and the negative values for   and  . Then   b  (  Y  ) are initialized as directly observable using Equation (8). Then, λ  is iteratively trained to produce   Y   = CC  until convergence  . For computational concerns, and to keep the approach as simple as possible, without losing performance in decoding, the means and variances were not learned, but just initialized. After learning, the DFC model   is used to decode   Y  , i.e., to infer the hidden state sequence   that best explains the observation CC . By way of example, Figure   shows the hidden state sequence   decoded from the CC  of Figure  , as well as the transition matrix Â obtained after learning. \n\nFinally, the DFC was compared between participants to detect if there was a significant DFC change between controls and patients. To this end, the DFC models λ , 1 ≤   n   ≤ 7, were compared in pairs by means of the distance measure   D   (see Equation (7)). First, the models were asked to generate   T   = 150 then   T   = 300 observations (against   T   = 103 for the real observations). Let {  D  } be the distances between all pairs of controls (190 pairs) and {  D  } the distances between all pairs of patients and controls (320 pairs). A two samples   t  -test was performed between the distance sets {  D  } and {  D  } for each of the 7 studied RSN. A positive result at a   t  -test (  p   < 0.01) would signify that a significant DFC change is observed between patients and controls with regard to the interactions between the RSN under concern and the six others. A complementary study has also been conducted that includes the other networks revealed by ICA (the central and the frontal networks), in place of BG and DMN which are less affected by DLB as previously described. \n\n\n#### 2.3.3. Product HMM tools for DFC analysis \n  \nAn interesting feature of product HMM, which makes the product HMM modeling and analysis framework attractive, is the range of analysis tools available for the user to investigate different aspects of the DFC. These tools can provide useful information of a global nature about the DFC or enable more insight to be gained into it. We have added more information about these tools and the interpretation of their output results before the Results section. \n\nThe distance measure of Equation (7) provides global information on the degree of similarity of two models of DFC: it allows pairs of models to be compared through their ability to separately generate the same observation sequence. We use this distance extensively to infer significant differences between the DFC models of DLB patients and those of healthy elderly subjects. \n\nAlso, the transition matrix   A   of a DFC model provides a compact and global representation of the statistical behavior of the observed DFC. It allows us to see at a glance which transitions are privileged, ignored or modified for a given subject or between subjects. But the transition matrix   A   also enables us to focus on more specific information. In particular, the diagonal term {  a  } corresponds to the loopback probability of state   i  , that is, the probability to stay in state   i   from   t   to   t   + 1. Its magnitude reflects the temporal stability of the DFC state or DFC configuration   i  . A brief look at the diagonal of   A   thus enables the number and nature (correlated or uncorrelated resting-state network involved) of steady DFC configurations to be rapidly identified. Similarly, the presence of high transition probabilities {  a  } on a column   j   in   A   is symptomatic of a DFC state, in this case state   j  , with a high probability to be reached. We therefore used the average of the terms of this column,   to quantify this probability. \n\nThe N-dimensional decoded state sequence   gives access to the symbolic transcription, expressed as a visited states-time sequence, of what is observed, in our case the correlation over time of one RSN with other RSNs. By preserving time information, the sequence   enables analysis to be focused on specific temporal windows of the fMRI exam. Such sequences can also be the starting point for simple or advanced analyses that enrich the DFC description. These analyses can be performed on a single sequence  , becoming specific of  , or performed on a set { } of decoded state sequences, in relation to a subject, a particular RSN, a group of subjects, or whatever the user wishes to target. It is thus possible to perform simple statistics that highlight the most common states, the ones never reached, the time spent in each state or the number of transitions. Advanced analyses, outside the scope of this paper and based on pattern recognition or data mining techniques, can also be envisaged to detect, for example, reproducible patterns of DFC. \n\n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Distances between controls and DLB patients \n  \nTable   shows the results of the two-sample   t  -tests for each of the seven RSNs, for   T   = 150 and   T   = 300 observations generated (see Equation 6). The occipito-parieto-frontal network (OPFN), the medial occipital network (MON) and the right fronto-parietal network (RFPN) presented a highly significant difference (  p   < 0.01) in DFC between patients and controls, for both   T  . (see Table   for the results for the complementary study with the frontal and central networks). \n  \n  p  -value of the   t  -tests for each RSN and number of generated observations  . \n  \n h = 1 indicates significant difference between DFC models of patients vs. controls (p < 0.01).

Product HMM analysis tools \n  \nWe present selected product HMM results obtained for the OPFN, MON, and RFPN. They illustrate how to obtain deeper insight into the DFC difference observed between DLB patients and controls for these three RSNs. \n\n#### 3.2.1. Transition matrices \n  \nFor all participants (patients and controls), a close examination of the transition matrices of these networks shows that the states with the highest probability to be reached are those with the OPN, the OPFN, and/or the MON in a “correlated” state (“+1”). A comparison of the DLB patients' transition matrices with the healthy subjects' transition matrices significantly revealed that states with MON and RFPN in a “correlated” state were more probably reached for healthy subjects than for patients (  p   = 0.044 < 0.05). \n\nOther typical product HMM output results are presented in Figure  , for a patient, and for the MON. The transition matrix   A   allowed us to isolate three states with the highest probability to be reached. These are, from left to right, the {opfn-RFPN-LFPN-OPN-dmn-bg}, the {OPFN-rfpn-lfpn-OPN-dmn-bg} and the {OPFN-rfpn-LFPN-OPN-DMN-bg} (with “correlated” states in upper case letters and “anti-correlated” states in lower case). The spatial maps of the “correlated” RSNs (in red) and the “anti-correlated” RSNs (in blue) with the MON (in yellow) are displayed in Figure  . \n  \n Outputs of the product HMM for patient #1: (A) transition matrix   A  ; (B) the 3 states with highest probabilities (coordinates in z axis are in white); (C) distribution of these 3 states reported on the CC  . On this figure, the MON is the reference RSN (in yellow on the RSN maps). (DMN, Default Mode Network; LFPN, Left Fronto-Parietal Network; RFPN, Right Fronto-Parietal Network; OPFN, Occipito-Parieto-Frontal Network; OPN, Occipital Posterior Network; MON, Medial Occipital Network; BG, Basal ganglia.) \n  \n\n#### 3.2.2. Decoded state sequences \n  \nFrom the decoded state sequences  ,  , and  , no difference was observed in the state change statistics. Twenty-two state changes and 18 distinct states were observed on average for each session of 6 min. On average, 3 to 4 states per subject, replicated at different times, presented a “long” state occupancy duration i.e., greater than one time-point). These states varied across subjects, even if we noticed that the most visited state (long and replicated) for   and for   was the same for both patients and controls, namely the state {OPFN/MON-rfpn-lfpn-OPN-DMN-bg}, (with “correlated” states in upper case letters and “anti-correlated” states in lower case). The mean of the state occupancy duration was 14 s for both DLB patients and controls (see Figure  ). \n\nFigure   shows a typical example of targeted information that can be derived at the subject level from a decoded state sequence: the distribution of three selected states, with their duration, along the time axis of the session. The three highlighted states are {opfn-RFPN-LFON-OPN-dmn-bg}, {OPFN-rfpn-lfpn-OPN-dmn-bg}, and {OPFN-rfpn-LFPN-OPN-DMN-bg}. Figure   presents the decoded state sequences   of each pair of interactions. Figure   zooms in on the first 30 s of the observation and decoded sequences that are presented Figure  . \n\n\n#### 3.2.3. Combining product HMM results \n  \nBased on the transition matrices of the MON, a relationship between this visual network and the attentional network RFPN was first underlined in Section 3.2.1. The following analysis shows how combining different product HMM results can provide extra information about specific RSN interactions. Focusing on interactions between the MON and the attentional networks (RFPN, LFPN) indeed showed that the sequences are significantly more occupied by states with “correlated LFPN,” “anti-correlated RFPN” (whatever the correlation state, “−1” or “+1,” of the other RSNs) for patients than for controls (  p   = 0.021 < 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric test). The mean occupation rate in a sequence by these states was 40% for patients against 22% for controls. \n\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \n### 4.1. DLB characterization \n  \nCompared to healthy elderly controls, patients with DLB showed changes in the dynamic interaction between the MON and the other networks, so did the OPFN and the RFPN. According to previous studies, the MON concerns visual processing (Beckmann et al.,  ), the OPFN underlies visuo-attentional and visuo-constructive processing (Fox et al.,  ), and the RFPN relates to executive control of attention (Seeley et al.,  ; Markett et al.,  ). Since patients with DLB suffer mainly from attentional (Ferman et al.,  ; Johns et al.,  ; Ferman et al.,  ; Yoon et al.,  ) and visual (Ferman et al.,  ,  ) impairments, the changes of DFC of these three networks are therefore consistent with the cognitive profile of DLB. They are also consistent with previous MRI studies on brain perfusion (Lobotesis et al.,  ; Colloby et al.,  ) and metabolism (Kantarci et al.,  ), which have reported a decrease of neural activity in the occipital cortex and frontal and parietal areas. Despite the occipital cortex having been suggested as the main deficit in DLB, static functional connectivity (Lowther et al.,  ; Peraza et al.,  ) failed to reveal any difference in visual networks, in contrast to our dynamic functional connectivity analysis. In addition, results from the transition matrix revealed that states involving “correlated” MON and RFPN, whatever the other networks, are significantly less likely to be reached in patients than in controls. This suggests a lack of specific interaction between right top-down attentional and bottom-up visual processes. On a similar note, focusing on the occupancy rate of states involving “correlated” MON and LFPN and “anti-correlated” RFPN highlighted a significant increase for DLB patients compared to controls. A similar trend for these states was observed when the OPFN is taken as the reference RSN instead of the MON. Taken together, all these results of DFC suggest that, in DLB, the visual networks and particularly the MON might interact less with the RFPN than with the LFPN. Such a result could reflect a compensatory phenomenon for the deficit of right attentional and visual interaction. \n\nWhereas previously identified differences concerned the global dynamics, they are not apparent from the number of transitions, the average duration in a state or the number of visited states. These measurements still provide information about variability of functional connectivity during an fMRI session. Thus, on average, only 18 distinct states were visited among the 64 theoretically observable, during a session of 6 min, with an average stability in a state of 14 s. Still, one might raise the question of the influence of age on this DFC characterization. \n\nIn addition, the presented method is performed at subject level. This allows the DFC study to be to individualized and can be useful for individual monitoring purposes. For instance, Figure   illustrates this possibility with patient 1. Unsurprisingly, the states reached with the highest probabilities are those with the MON, the OPFN, and the OPN, the three visual networks, working together. Examining each decoded sequence,  , related to the PHMM , we noticed that the LFPN and the RFPN seemed to appear mostly in opposite timing (see Figure  ), with quasi-synchronous changes of state. This might be interpreted from the perspective of inter-hemispheric valence (Banich,  ) and informs us on the dissociation of these two networks that are, however, very related from an functional connectivity point of view. Now that specific RSNs (OPFN, MON, RFPN) have shown their interest in DFC for DLB studies, a PHMM-based model, built on a chosen network for each DLB patient, can be considered as a new application for specific DFC characterization of a resting-state network. \n\n\n### 4.2. Product HMM modeling and analysis of DFC \n  \nAll the presented results show the capabilities of product HMM to model and analyze multiple processes interacting in time, such as the DFC between networks observed by resting-state fMRI. They also demonstrate how it is possible to capture by statistical learning, spatial and temporal relationships between RSNs within a probabilistic state graph. Finally, they illustrate the range of analysis tools that are immediately available within the product HMM framework i.e., to compare distinct DFC from their model, or to further characterize them from their state transition matrix or from their decoded state sequence. \n\nFrom a modeling perspective, we chose a multi-dimensional HMM to represent the processes of the RSNs and thus we defined the states as vectors of sub-states. Our study, although providing tools to differentiate DLB patients from healthy controls, was also designed to present a method to explore DFC. To this end, the states are built on the RSNs present during the session, and prior to the DFC analysis. A large state space is thus constructed and accounts for all possible multidimensional connectivity states between RSNs, even if most of them are not, or cannot be, observed within the limited time windows of an resting-state fMRI session. This leads to a high number of states compared to the one defined directly on the DFC observations as DFC analysis methods based on state clustering (Allen et al.,  ; Eavani et al.,  ; Ma et al.,  ). While it is true that a large state space can lead to a certain redundancy due to close spatial profiles (functional connectivity maps of states) between states, this allows the emergence of finer connectivity configurations, including states with short duration and low occurrence. Note that these close spatial profiles can be   a posteriori   gathered to restrict the analysis to some chosen states if one wants to target some RSNs (an illustration can be found in Figure   where similar color tones have been applied to highlight specific interactions). This allows a better understanding while ensuring that a larger number of RSNs had been taken into account during the modeling step. \n\nStill from a modeling perspective, the proposed approach remains simple yet efficient. It is of low complexity, and presents some limitations. It is simple regarding the state sub-space   S   since we did not consider a decorrelated situation between two RSNs, as might be done with a “0” state in addition to the “−1” and “+1.” A direct consequence of this modeling extension would be a transition matrix   A   of dimension 3  × 3 . The introduction of such a neutral state also raises the question of the threshold above and below which we consider, respectively, the correlated and uncorrelated state. DFC modeling is not well known and a question rises as to whether or not the DFC is modulated by a central executive. Exploiting a hierarchical structure would enable modeling different levels and length scales that might be present in the brain DFC. Our approach also relies on a compromise between the state space cardinality and the available amount of data. First, we only capture what may be seen throughout the duration of the fMRI session. On the other hand, the parameter space grows exponentially with the number of hidden processes, leading us to limit the approach to the joint analysis of a subset of RSNs. Although our results finally showed that only a few states were achieved with regard to the possibilities (about 18 distinct states observed within the 64 defined and 103 time-points), too many states would have meant that the parameter estimation step would not have been robust. Possible solutions to these issues could be to reduce the number of conditional dependencies between states, as proposed in coupled Markov models, another variant of multi-dimensional HMM, or to extensively use parameter tying in order to limit drastically the total number of parameters to be learned. \n\nFrom an analytic perspective, the product HMM tools are numerous. The transition matrix provides information on the most likely transitions, on the state with the highest probability to be reached or on the stability of states, expressed in terms of probability with the values of the diagonals {  a  }. The decoded state sequence brings information at different scales of analysis : at a global scale when considering  , at a lower scale when looking for specific interactions with  . On one hand,   gives us access to the number of state changes, the most reproduced states, the average duration in a state and especially the temporal distribution of the states in the session. This latter aspect is of particular interest if one seeks to interpret certain functional connectivity states only present at the beginning or at the end of the session as, for example, in resting-state studies, or in task-based fMRI. On the other hand, the   focuses on a particular interaction. For instance, the ratio between the number of “correlated” and “anti-correlated” states offers information about the relationship between two specific RSNs. \n\nProduct HMM, of course, do not and will not reveal all the aspects of DFC. However, we believe that such advanced graph theoretical approaches open the door to complementary analysis techniques, of a higher level and working on top of product HMM, such as data mining, structural analysis, pattern recognition, chronic extraction, and/or temporal reasoning. These techniques, coupled with product HMM, should help us to answer typical questions in DFC analysis, such as: which RSNs, at what time and for what duration enter in correlation? Does the DFC pattern selected by the user exist, and if so, is it reproducible, and to what extent? Does any significant DFC pattern emerge across this pool of fMRI data? More broadly, these techniques applied to product HMM outputs should reveal not only DFC patterns but also “DFC grammars” subject-, group-, or disease-specific in relation, for this latter aspect, with the concept of biomarker. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe presented a novel graph theoretical approach for the modeling and analysis of brain dynamic functional connectivity. The approach is based on product HMM, an instance of dynamic Bayesian network able to learn temporal dependencies between interacting processes. From the DFC modeling of a pool of RSNs, the product HMM framework was illustrated in differentiating patients with DLB from healthy elderly subjects. The comparison of distances between DFC models pointed out three RSNs serving the cognitive functions that are known to be impaired in DLB: mainly visual processing but also attentional and executive functions. Whereas static functional connectivity did not reveal any difference in visual networks in DLB, product HMM-based analysis of DFC succeeded in highlighting such occipital functional dysconnectivity. Novel statistical tools for further analysis of DFC were also presented within the product HMM framework. Their output results, even if some are difficult to interpret today, demonstrated the relevance of graph-based DFC modeling for the analysis and characterization of neurodegenerative diseases such as DLB. Also, they allow us to envisage in the near future the coupling of product HMM/DBN with data mining techniques and/or structural analysis techniques of a higher level to reveal DFC patterns or DFC “grammars” in relation to the concept of biomarker. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nMS and LT designed the study.

However, measurements and estimations are often noisy and many of the algorithms used are probabilistic, which in combination have been argued to limit studies exploring the neural basis of specific aspects of cognition. Focusing on static and dynamic functional connectivity estimations, we propose to leverage this variability to improve statistical efficiency in relating these estimations to behavior. To achieve this goal, we use a procedure based on permutation testing that provides a way of combining the results from many individual tests that refer to the same hypothesis. This is needed when testing a measure whose value is obtained from a noisy process, which can be repeated multiple times, referred to as replications. Focusing on functional connectivity, this noisy process can be: (a) computational, for example, when using an approximate inference algorithm for which different runs can produce different results or (b) observational, if we have the capacity to acquire data multiple times, and the different acquired data sets can be considered noisy examples of some underlying truth. In both cases, we are not interested in the individual replications but on the unobserved process generating each replication. In this note, we show how results can be combined instead of choosing just one of the estimated models. Using both simulations and real data, we show the benefits of this approach in practice. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nSuppose that we are interested in testing hypotheses about variables, or set of variables, which we can observe on multiple occasions such that we may obtain a number of noisy measures of the same underlying (unobserved) feature or process. This can happen when we replicate a measurement on multiple occasions for each subject, or if the design of the experiment is such that the repetitions are independent of each other (which would not be the case, for example, if there is a strong effect of learning or habituation across runs). This can also happen when we are modeling data using an approach that is complex enough that inferences about the model parameters can be slightly different every time we estimate the model, for example, with different arbitrary initializations. This is the case, for example, for independent component analysis (ICA, Hyvarinen & Oja,  ; Beckmann, DeLuca, Devlin, & Smith,  ) and Hidden Markov models (HMM, Rabiner,  ; Vidaurre et al.,  ). \n\nIn nondeterministic approaches such as ICA and HMM, the degree to which different initializations will lead to different estimates (i.e., different local minima) of the model parameters depends on elements such as the signal‐to‐noise ratio, training parameters, and amount of available data (Himberg, Hyvärinen, & Exposito,  ). Successive runs of the algorithm may find local minima that are equally good or equally likely, or it may find suboptimal local minima. While in some settings an appropriate figure of merit (e.g., residual sum of squares or model evidence) can adjudicate between these different estimates, sometimes no practical or definitive model comparison score is available; furthermore, even when a score is available, this is typically an approximation or a heuristic, and it is possible that many models with very similar scores will be found. Here we claim that all models are potentially useful and that an effective combination can be more powerful than choosing a single model. More specifically, in this work, we take up the issue of making inference on these noisy replicate estimates, relating the estimates on a group of subjects to variables such as demographics, behavior or personality scores. For this, we are not interested in whether each score relates to each individual replicate; rather, we aim to assess, based on a single global test over the pool of estimates, whether there is evidence that each score holds a significant association with the estimated measure. \n\nBased on the principles of permutation testing, this article presents a simple approach where we use the   non‐parametric combination   NPC algorithm (Pesarin & Salmaso,  ; Winkler et al.,  ) to combine results from multiple functional connectivity (FC) estimations, regardless of whether the replications are at the level of data acquisition or model inference. This approach is useful in estimating effects that explain the underlying data that is the focus of the analysis. We demonstrate the validity of this method on the HMM, using simulations and data from the Human Connectome Project (Smith et al.,  ), where we test a measure of (resting state fMRI) dynamic FC over 100 different HMM runs against a number of behavioral variables measured across hundreds of subjects. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Background \n  \nWe refer to the noisy samples or parameter inference runs as   R replications  , to be distinguished from the   P observed variables   against which we aim to test. (Replications are not to be confused with   realizations  , which we will use to refer to the multiple instances of the synthetic experimental scenario carried out below). We have one hypothesis per observed variable and wish to combine the tests across multiple replications, with no particular interest in assessing each replication in isolation. For   N   subjects, let us denote replications as    Y    (  N   by   R  ), and observed variables as    X    (  N   by   P  ). For reference, we will consider each column of    Y    (referred to as    y   ) as a noisy sample of the certain unobservable variable of interest   Y  . \n\nFor each column of    Y    and each column of    X    (referred to as    x   ), we can use permutations (Nichols & Holmes,  ) to test the null hypothesis that there is no association between the model and the observed data. From this procedure, we obtain a (1 by   R  ) vector of   p   values per observed variable, say    p   . A simple approach could combine these   R   values with a simple statistic such as the mean or the median of    p    to assess the significance: if the mean   p   value is small (e.g., below 0.01), this would suggest that there is a significant relationship between   Y   and    x   . In what follows, we will refer to this summarised   p   value as   p  , similar to Edgington's   p   value combining method comprised of the sum of   p   values (Edgington,  ). A more effective approach is to use the geometric mean, equivalent to exponentiating the average of the log   p   values; this is related to Fisher's   p   value combining method (Fisher,  ) and amplifies the importance of values near zero. Denoting the individual   p  values for a given observed variable of interest as   p  , we have \n\nAgain, if   p   is below a certain level, we can state there is a significant relationship between the replications and the examined observed variable. Note that neither   p   or   p   are   p   values because they do not distribute uniformly in [0,1] under the null. \n\n\n### Example case for a single pair of variables \n  \nBefore coming to a complete description we consider a toy example to make the point above more concrete. We wish to assess if there is a linear relationship between two variables,    a    and    b   . The first one,    a   , with values   a  , is Gaussian distributed (mean 0, standard deviation [  SD  ] 1); the second one,    b   , is a corrupted version of    a    by the introduction of random noise: \n\nwhere   ε   are independent, Gaussian distributed random variables (mean 0,   SD   = 1), and   κ   ≥ 0  .   We generate replicates of    b    based on independent realizations of noise   ε   and   κ  , where   κ   is randomly sampled from a uniform distribution between 0 and   c.   We choose   c   to define the expected strength of the relationship between    a    and    b   . We then run permutation testing on each data set. We evaluate the power of the permutation combining method to detect a relationship between    a    and    b    for different values of   c   > 0. Even when   κ   is randomly small on some replicates, it may be large on others (allowing to detect the underlying relationship in these cases). \n\nFor the purpose of illustration, we generated 1,000 data sets using   N   = 100, each with a different value of   κ   sampled from a uniform distribution and performed permutation testing for each of them. We repeat this for three different values of   c  : 0.0, 0.1, and 0.2. Figure   shows histograms of correlation coefficients between    a    and    b    across data sets (top), and histograms of   p   values (bottom). If the empirical distribution of   p   values is basically flat, as is the case when   c   = 0.0, then there is no evidence of a relationship between    a    and    b  .   However, when   c   = 0.1 or   c   = 0.2, then the distribution of   p   values gets increasingly skewed toward zero despite the generally low correlations. Therefore, if    a    and    b    were experimental replications of some pair of unobserved processes, we could intuitively say that there are signs of correlation between these processes in the   c   = 0.1 and   c   = 0.2 cases. However, neither   p   or   p   (data not shown in the figure) are below 0.05; they are higher than 0.2 in all cases, emphasizing again the point that   p   or   p   are not   p   values and, thus, the need for a permutation procedure to learn their null distribution. \n  \nDistribution of correlation and (first‐level)   p   values for the toy example. Simulated examples where we generated 1,000 data sets, where maximum regression coefficient,   c  , is systematically varied. When   c   > 0.0, the mean correlation across data sets is higher than zero (top), and the distribution of   p   values is skewed toward 0.0 (bottom). However, both   p   and   p   are higher than .05 [Color figure can be viewed at  ] \n  \n\n### The NPC algorithm \n  \nGiven a data set with   N   subjects, we are interested in the relationship between the underlying variables (of which the replications are noisy observations), and not on the individual replications. Since   p   or   p   cannot be interpreted as   p   values, we require a method to estimate actual   p   values, that is, distributed uniformly under the null hypothesis. For this, we use the NPC algorithm on   p   (Pesarin & Salmaso,  ; Winkler et al.,  ). In the case when there is only one variable in the model (  p   = 1), referred to as    x   , NPC (on   p  ) proceeds as follows:   \nRun statistical tests (e.g.,   t   tests) between each replication    y    and    x    to obtain an (  R   by 1) vector of   p   values    p   . We summarise    p    using the geometric mean, which, using Equation  , yields   p  . This corresponds to the first‐level permutation testing. \n  \nUnder the null hypothesis that each replication    y    and    x    are not associated, we randomly permute    x    a number of times   K.   For each permutation   k  , we produce an (  R   by 1) vector of parametric   p   values    p    analogously to the previous step. We summarise    p    using the geometric mean, obtaining a surrogate   p   value   p   per permutation. \n  \nAt the second level, we obtain a final value by computing the proportion of surrogate   p   values   p   that are equal to or lower than the unpermuted summary   p   value   p  : \n  \n\nFor the   p   > 1 case, that is, when there is more than one observed variable of interest, this procedure can be repeated for each variable, using Equation   on the    x    separately. Crucially, we would use the same exact same permutations—that is, with the permutations happening in synchrony for all observed variables. This way, the dependence between the tests across variables is implicitly accounted for; in Winkler et al. ( ), this is referred to as “multiple models”. This will yield a final   p   value per observed variable, say   p  . We can obtain a summary, family‐wise error corrected   p   value (Nichols & Hayasaka,  ) for each variable of interest   j   by computing where   p   is the null surrogate   p   value obtained with Equation   for the   j   variable of interest and   k   permutation. Alternatively, we can use false‐discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini & Hochberg,  ; Nichols & Hayasaka,  ) on the uncorrected   p   values   p   to obtain FDR‐corrected   p   values   p  . \n\nIn summary, this procedure draws statistical power from both working in logarithmic space (i.e., promoting the importance of   p   values closer to zero), and simultaneously relaxing the alternative hypothesis from the highly conservative “  all   of the replications bear a relationship with the corresponding observed variable” to the less conservative “  at least   some of the replications bear a relationship with the corresponding observed variable”. In the above example, for instance, this scheme of permutation testing produced a   p   value higher than 0.5 when   c   = 0.0, and   p   values lower than 0.001 for both the   c   = 0.1 and   c   = 0.2 cases, exhibiting both sensitivity and robustness to nonnormality (given that no distributional assumptions are made). \n\nMATLAB scripts for the NPC algorithm and the simulations below can be found in Github. \n\n\n### Regression‐based permutation testing \n  \nFor comparison with the NPC, we briefly outline here an alternative also based on the principles of permutation testing, but where we use multivariate regression in order to integrate over replications. That is, instead of performing univariate statistical testing between each replication and each behavioral variable and then combining the resulting first‐level   p   values using the geometric mean (Step I in the NPC algorithm outlined above), now we use multivariate regression where we predict each behavioral variable using all replications as predictors; we used regularised ridge regression (using a minimal penalty) to alleviate overfitting in the regression and to avoid algebraic indeterminacies when   R   >   N.   Instead of a   p   value combining function with NPC, an   F  ‐test is used to summarise all the regression coefficients (i.e., to integrate across replications), and this F score is converted to a   p   value parametrically. We embed this estimation into a standard permutation testing procedure. The final   p   value is eventually computed as in Step III. We shall refer to it as   p  . \n\n\n\n## SIMULATIONS \n  \nTo illustrate the power of combining FC estimations using NPC, we simulated synthetic data sets emulating a scenario in which we are interested in testing whether FC between a pair of brain regions holds a relation to certain behavioral trait in a set of   N   subjects. In this situation, we have the following variables:   \nA subject‐specific FC coefficient   β  , which we cannot observe directly. \n  \nA behavioral variable hypothesized to be related to FC and encoded by a (  N   by 1) vector    x  ,   that can be observed directly. \n  \nSome neural process modulated by   β   denoted as    S   , which we cannot observe directly. We can consider    S    to be some archetypical, noiseless brain activity controlled by   β.  \n  \nThe observed (e.g., neuroimaging) data sets    D   , which are noisy measurements of    S    and have a dimension (  T   by 2). This measurement can be repeated up to   R   times per subject. \n  \nAn (  N   by   R  ) matrix    Y   , such that   Y   contains the estimated FC value for the   n   subject and   j   experimental replication (i.e., the correlation coefficient between the channels of the corresponding measured data    D   ). \n  \n\nA schematic of this experimental case is presented in Figure   for clarity. As explained in detail below, the value of   β   is specific for each subject, and its mean over subjects is zero by design. The hypothesis that we are here testing, therefore, is not whether   β   is different from zero, but whether there is an association between   β   and behavior (represented by    x   ). The objective of this simulation is then to assess whether the proposed approach can uncover such relationship, mirroring real data situations often found in the literature where the interest is relating functional connectivity to subject phenotypes (e.g., Smith et al.,  ). Note that, regardless of the generating model for    Y   , the final goal is to test the relation between    x    and    Y   , and the NPC algorithm could have been applied similarly to other generative models. \n  \nSchematic of the model used for the simulations analysis. The dotted arrow represents the correlation we are testing \n  \nWe next provide details about the generating process for    x    and    Y   . In this specific context, the noise in the observations (or replications) stems from the imperfect measurement of    S   , which we can measure multiple times (  R  ). Therefore, there is a relation between FC (  β  , which we cannot observe but we can estimate) and behavior (   x   ), but this relationship is noisy and weak for some replications. In detail, we generated data from this setting as follows. \n\nWe have   N   = 200 subjects. We uniformly sampled a value   β   between −0.2 and + 0.2 for each subject   n.   For each subject, also, we sampled two vectors with 10,000 values each: the first,    s   , is Gaussian distributed (mean = 0,   SD   = 1), whereas the second is set as \n\nwhere    ε    is also Gaussian‐distributed. The vectors    s    and    s    constitute the unobserved neural process    S   . The correlation between    s    and    s    can be analytically computed from   β   as \n\nWe set the value of the observed behavioral variable for each subject to be where   η   is Gaussian distributed (mean = 0,   SD   = 1). Now, to sample the observed data sets    D    for each subject, we randomly sampled   T   = 100‐time points from    S    (whose columns are    s    and    s   ) and added some Gaussian noise with mean = 0 and   SD   =   σ.   We did this   R   times per subject, obtaining one (100 by 2) noisy data set    D    = [   d   ,    d   ] each time. We then set the observed replication values to where we applied the   z  ‐transformation on the resulting correlation to make appropriate for parametric testing. \n\nNote that, as illustrated in Figure  , the (unobserved) value   β  n is involved in both the generation of    Y    and    x   . With both    Y    and    x    in hand, we ran the described permutation testing algorithm on the noisily estimated FC matrix    Y    and the behavioral variable    x   . By controlling   σ   (which defines how noisy are individual time series samples    d    and    d   ), we could make the detection more or less difficult. \n\nWe used a range of 30 values for   σ   between 0.25 and 1.5, and repeated the experiment, that is, data generation and testing, 100 times per value of   σ.   For each repetition of the experiment, standard permutation testing resulted on   R   = 100   p   values (one per replication). Since   p   = 1, there was no need to control for familywise error rate across observed variables (Equation  ). \n\nAlongside the NPC, we also ran for comparison the regression‐based permutation testing approach described above, denoted as   p  . Figure  a shows   p  /  p  /  p  /  p   (respectively from left to right) averaged across the 100 realizations of the experiment as a function of   σ  , together with 95% confidence intervals (minus/plus twice the standard error). We ran 10,000 permutations in each case. Thanks to the effect of the logarithm, the   p   values are lower than   p   values, but neither of them ever reached significance provided the weak and volatile relationship between    Y    and    x   . The individual per replication   p   values (shown in Figure  b for one example repetition, per value of   σ  , together with the corresponding correlation coefficients) illustrate this point: although there were some significant   p   values, the average is condemned to fail due to the frequent bad   p   values associated to some too noisy replications. The   p   values did not reach significance either, probably because of a loss of statistical power due to overfitting in the regressions (given that   N   = 200 is not much higher than   R   = 100). However, most of the   p   values from the NPC permutation approach turned out to be significant despite the low magnitude of the signal across replications, with the average of   p   across realisations of the experiment leaving the zone of significance only for the highest values of   σ   (i.e., for the hardest instantiations of the problem). \n  \nResults from the simulated data with   N   = 200, where there is a relationship between the tested variables: FC and behavior. (a)   p   Values obtained from combining tests using the mean (  p   and   p  ),   p   values from the regression‐based permutation testing approach (  p  ), and   p   values from the described permutation testing approach (  p  ), as a function of   σ  , which controls the noise in the replications (i.e., higher values of   σ   produce more difficult instantiations of the problem); 95% confidence intervals are computed across realizations of the experiment. (b)   p   Values before test combination for a given repetition (per value of   σ  ), together with the estimated correlation coefficients [Color figure can be viewed at  ] \n  \nSupporting Information Figures S1 and S2 show additional simulations for   N   = 50 and   N   = 1,000 subjects, respectively. In the most difficult case,   N   = 50, both   p   and   p   were far from any level of statistical significance, and   p  , although exhibiting lower   p   values than   p   and   p  , reached significance only occasionally (but more often than   p  ). In the easiest   N   = 1,000 cases,   p   was under 0.05 for the lowest levels of noise, and   p   reached values under 0.05 for half of the range of   σ  ;   p  , however, stayed most of the time at the minimum levels allowed by the number of permutations (i.e., 1/10,001), clearly outperforming   p   and   p  . Comparatively,   p   also reached significance for the entire range, but less strongly than   p  . As observed, the NPC outperformed this alternative in every case. This was expected because univariate calculations are more robust to overfitting that multivariate regression, which hinders the latter's statistical power. \n\nNext, we repeated the same analysis but forcing a fixed value of   β   for all subjects (in particular, we set   β   = 0). In this case, there is not a relationship between behavior and FC. Figure   shows that NPC, as well as the other methods, is robust to Type I errors. \n  \nResults from the simulated data, where there is   not   a relationship between FC and behavior. The description of the panels is equivalent to Figure  . In this case, however, the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap with the region of statistical significance no relation was found between FC and behavior, that is, there was no Type I errors [Color figure can be viewed at  ] \n  \n\n## DYNAMIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN REAL DATA \n  \nHaving demonstrated the utility of the NPC approach to relate FC to behavior in a synthetic scenario where the estimation was very noisy, we next evaluated it using real data by applying the Hidden Markov model (HMM) to resting state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The HMM assumes that the data can be described using a finite number of states. Each state is represented using a probability distribution, which in this case is chosen to be a Gaussian distribution (Vidaurre, Smith, & Woolrich,  ); that is, each state is described by a characteristic pattern of BOLD activation and a certain FC profile (we use the same configuration as in Vidaurre, Smith, and Woolrich ( ), to which we refer for further details). As the HMM is applied at the group level, the estimated states are shared across subjects; however, the state time courses that indicate the moments in time when each state is active are unique to a given individual. For the purposes of this analyses, we set the HMM to have 12 states. Note that, as discussed in former work (Vidaurre et al.,  ), there is no specific biological significance in the chosen number of states, and a different number of states just provide different levels of detail in the HMM decomposition. Here, we chose 12 states simply to be consistent with our previous work on this data set (Vidaurre, Smith, & Woolrich,  ). Using the inferred state time courses, the amount of   state‐switching   for each subject was calculated, which corresponds to a metric of how frequently subjects transition between different brain states (more specifically, given that the state time courses are probabilistic assignments, we compute the mean derivative of the state time courses for each subject). We used state‐switching as a summary metric of dynamic functional connectivity (DFC). \n\nIn order to infer the HMM at reasonable cost in spite of the large amount of data (820 subjects by four sessions by 15 min, TR = 0.75 s), we used a stochastic learning procedure (Vidaurre et al.,  ), which involved performing noisy, yet economical, updates during the inference. Since stochastic inference brings an additional layer of randomness into the HMM estimation but is not costly to run, we repeated the HMM inference 100 times and computed state‐switching for each run. In this context, each HMM estimation constitutes a replication. Following the paper notation, we denote the state‐switching measure for subject   n   and replication   j   (averaged across the four sessions) as   Y  . \n\nAlthough stochastic inference adds additional randomness to the estimation, the HMM has have previously been reported to perform very robustly in this data set (Vidaurre, Smith, & Woolrich,  ), possibly as a consequence of the large number of subjects (  N   = 820), the length of the scanning sessions, and the general high quality of the data. For this reason, the different HMM runs were quite consistent, which in turn means that the tests produce relatively similar results across replications (as shown below). To illustrate the effect of greater noise, we created a second set of replications where we permuted the state‐switching measure between subjects randomly for half of the HMM runs (i.e., half of the HMM runs, or replications, are potentially related to behavior whereas the other half are noise, and all of them are included in the analysis). We refer to this as the   perturbed   data, as opposed to the   original   data where the HMM estimations are left intact. \n\nFurthermore, each subject has a number of behavioral measures, including psychological and sociological factors and several health‐related markers. We used a total of 228 behavioral variables, after discarding those with more than 25% of missing values, to test against DFC as measure by state‐switching. We included age, sex, motion, and body‐mass‐index (the latter two usually considered as confounds). We also discarded those subjects without family information and those with a missing value in any of the behavioral variables. We denote the (  N   by   P  ) matrix of subject traits as    X   . \n\nWe tested for significance in the correlation between switching rates across replications (   Y   ) and each of the subject traits, contained in the columns of    X,    for both the original and the perturbed data set. We used 10,000 permutations, respecting the family structure of the HCP subjects (Winkler, Webster, Vidaurre, Nichols, & Smith,  ). \n\nFigure   compares the results of applying the NPC approach described above with the mean and geometric mean of the   p   values (  p   and   p  ) as well as with the alternative regression‐based permutation testing outlined above (  p  ). Figure  a shows the mean   p   value (averaged across replications) reflecting the subject‐wise correlation of state‐switching (as measured by the HMM) with the different behavioral variables, with the behavioral variables being ordered from more to less significant; for purposes of illustration, dots represent individual   p   values for some randomly chosen replications. On the left, the   p   values obtained from standard permutation testing on the original HMM runs are quite consistent across replications; on the right, for the perturbed set of HMM runs, given that half were randomly ordered over subjects, the mean   p   value reflects the reduced effect strength. \n  \nAnalysis of the relation between behavior and DFC (state switching) as measured by the HMM, where replications correspond to HMM runs. (a) Mean   p   values (averaged over replications, with dots representing   p   values for a randomly chosen subset of 10% of the individual replications), reflecting the subject‐wise correlation of DFC with the different behavioral variables. On the   X  ‐axis, behavioral variables are ordered from more to less correlated. On the left, this is shown for the original data set; on the right, this is shown for the perturbed data set (a noisier version of the original data set). (b) Histograms of   p   values, indicating that   p   and   p   generally outperform   p   and   p  . (c) The   p   values are robust to perturbation only for NPC, where the correlation between perturbed and original   p   values is close to 1.0 \n  \nIn Figure  b, we examine the histograms of   p   values for each of the four alternatives (with a loose use of the term “  p   value” when referring to   p   and   p  ). On top, where all the HMM runs were used normally, the difference between methods is somewhat subtle. At the bottom, no variable was under significance level for   p  , and only 30 variables were under significance level for   p  ; in contrast, over 60 variables turned out to be significant for   p   and   p  . The difference between   p   and   p   conveys the benefits of working on logarithm space, whereas the difference between   p   and   p   reflects the transformation needed to convert   p   to quantities interpretable as conventional   p   values. According to the small differences between   p   and   p  , the latter factor seemed to make the biggest difference in this data set. Regarding the regression‐based permutation method (  p  ), given that we have 100 replications in this case and a large number of good‐quality subjects, the regressions did not suffer from overfitting as much as in the simulations above. \n\nFigure  c shows, for each of the methods, the (combined across replications)   p   values for the original data versus the perturbed data, reflecting that only the NPC approach was robust to having corrupted replications (i.e., the   p   values are almost identical between the original and the perturbed data set). \n\nFigure   presents the behavioral variables for which we found significance using the NPC procedure. Interestingly, although motion is a significant predictor it does not explain the greatest variance in this analysis, suggesting that DFC on resting state fMRI, as estimated by HMM, can be meaningfully related to behavior beyond the influence of motion. Most of the traits that were found significant were health‐related, with fewer higher‐level psychological traits than were found by Smith et al. ( ), which focused on functional connectivity instead of any dynamic aspects of the data (such as the state‐switching rate). Due to the relatively large number of observed variables, only a few were found to be significant after FWE correction (i.e., in Equation  , the minimum of the surrogate   p   values across observed variables can be small if there are many observed variables to choose from). In contrast, FDR (Nichols & Hayasaka,  ), allowed the identification of up to 25 variables. When we randomly corrupted the entire data set (instead of half of the subjects as in the perturbed data set), all methods, including NPC, were able to satisfactorily control for Type I errors (data not shown). \n  \nFor the observed variables considered to be significant (out of 228), (a)   p   values using the NPC on   p   approach (  p  ), with FWE significance indicated on the top left; and (b) FDR‐corrected   p   values (  p  ) [Color figure can be viewed at  ] \n  \n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this article, we show that the stochastic nature of FC estimations often considered a hindrance, can be effectively integrated to provide valid and sensitive inferential procedures. If the differences between the estimations are not only due to random noise but contain different elements of information, such integration can be largely beneficial. If these differences are just pure noise, the presented procedure can approximate the accuracy of a single, noise‐free estimation. \n\nOn these grounds, we describe a permutation testing approach based on previous work (Pesarin & Salmaso,  ; Winkler et al.,  ) that can be used to test for the relationship between a set of observed variables and an unobserved (FC‐based) variable for which we have a number of noisy estimations. The crucial point is that we are not interested in finding the relationships as described by a particular FC estimation, but instead would like to understand the relationship of the   true   FC with the observed variables. We took as a concrete example the relationship between covert patterns of intrinsic brain connectivity, as they occur at rest, and patterns of cognitive and demographic variables measured outside of the scanner, using data from the Human Connectome Project. \n\nAlthough we focused on univariate observed variables and replications, the described method can straightforwardly be extended in a number of ways. First, although we focused on linear relationships between variables, it can easily be extended to multivariate statistics, such as multivariate linear regression, or canonical correlation analysis. This is important in that it allows studies in which the mapping between cognitive function and the data is not univariate in nature. It can also be extended to situations when we have replications on both sides of the correlation, such as when both the observed and nonobserved behaviors are measured on multiple occasions. In this case, each pair of replications could be tested individually (for each element of the corresponding Cartesian product), and we would proceed similarly. \n\nMoving forward, these types of approaches are likely to be particularly important in the domain of neuroscience given recent shifts toward the use of intrinsic connectivity at rest as a method of evaluating structural features of cognition. Intrinsic connectivity, as measured at rest, is a powerful tool for exploring the structure of neural organization since it is able to reveal similar patterns of neural organization as emerge during tasks (Smith et al.,  ). In addition, the simple noninvasive nature of the use of resting state as a method for assessing neural function means that it can be applied to multiple different populations, even those for whom task‐based measures of neural function or psychological measurements may be problematic (such as children or populations with cognitive problems). Measuring neural organization at rest is also easy to implement across centers making it amenable to the creation of large multicentre data sets, a shift that is likely to be increasingly important as neuroscience faces up to the challenges of reproducible science. \n\nDespite the promise that assessing neural function at rest holds, many of the same features that make it an appealing tool for the cognitive neuroscience community are also at the heart of many of its limitations. For example, the power that is gained by the unobtrusive nature of the measure of neural function at rest also leads to concerns regarding what the measures actually represent: it is unclear which aspects of the neural signal reflect the intrinsic organisation of neural function, which reflect artefacts that emerge from physiological noise or motion (Power et al.,  ), and which reflect the patterns of ongoing experience that frequently emerge when individuals are not occupied by a demanding external task (Gorgolewski et al.,  ; Vatansever et al.,  ). In this context, because the underlying ground truth is unknown, an effective way to integrate estimations will help the researcher to identify which aspects of a given neural pattern are expressed in a robust way in relation to neurocognitive function. \n\nAlthough dynamic approaches to understanding functional connectivity space are growing in popularity (Chang & Clover,  ; Vidaurre, Smith, & Woolrich,  ), different approaches have specific limitations. For example, sliding window approaches depend upon an apriori selection of the window length, which limits the granularity of neurocognitive states that can be identified. While approaches such as HMM circumvent this problem by allowing the data to determine the temporal duration of the underlying states, these analyses are inherently probabilistic and parameter inference can introduce noise into the analysis. In this context, NPC allows dynamic approaches to cognition to be compared to observed data in a systematic manner. This could help pave the way to formally evaluate how different descriptions of the underlying dynamics at rest best predict variables with well‐described links to cognitive function. This way, NPC can become a useful tool in resolving the state–trait dichotomy that currently hinders the development of the science of how neural function evolves at rest. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"fdedb8364923396f7047169cb1d7c6c0"},

Due to historical reasons and preconceptions about the limitations of this brain imaging method, most studies have focused on assessing connectivity over extended periods of time. It is now clear that fMRI can resolve the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity, like other faster imaging techniques such as electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography (albeit on a different temporal scale). However, the indirect nature of fMRI measurements can hinder the interpretability of the results. After briefly summarizing recent advances in the field, we discuss how the simultaneous combination of fMRI with electrophysiological activity measurements can contribute to a better understanding of dynamic functional connectivity in humans both during rest and task, wakefulness, and other brain states. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \n is a broad term used to denote statistical co-variation between activity time series in different brain regions ( ). It should not come as a surprise that functional connectivity is not static but under constant change. If functional connectivity is considered a proxy for how tightly brain regions interact, then static values represent a fixed scheme for the transmission of information between cortical areas. This view is incompatible with the dynamic nature of the challenges posed by our environment. Even during rest and sleep static connectivity cannot be expected, since spontaneous activity re-capitulates the patterns observed during task performance and sensory stimulation ( ). \n \nThis concept refers to signals of neural origin that co-vary over time, for instance, two regions showing similar temporal patterns of spontaneous activity fluctuations. In fMRI signals, functional connectivity is commonly measured by linear correlation. Functional connectivity does not imply a causal mechanism between the signals. \n \nHowever, until recently functional magnetic resonance imaging   studies focused on functional connectivity as computed from signals extracted over extended periods of time. In the case of resting-state analyses this usually corresponds to the whole duration of the scanning session (commonly 5–10 min). This is in contrast with other neuroimaging modalities such as   (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), for which long-dated precedents on how to measure and interpret dynamic changes in functional connectivity exist [see for instance ( )]. The relatively late blooming of assessing the temporal dynamics of connectivity using fMRI is likely based on preconceptions about the limitations of the technique. Compared to MEG and EEG, fMRI has a relatively slow temporal sampling rate. With one measurement every 2 s (a typical value) a 10 min session would yield 300 data points. Van Dijk et al. showed that connectivity estimates become unreliable when computed over windows shorter than approximately 4 min ( ). In this context, “reliability” is relative to the static connectivity estimates computed using whole time series. Additionally, electrophysiological activity is represented in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals as convolved with the hemodynamic response function, which acts as a low-pass filter and lags the BOLD response ( ). At the core of using long time series for computing connectivity estimates are the following assumptions: (i) short temporal windows result in noisy estimates of connectivity, (ii) very short temporal windows might fail to disambiguate different neuroelectrical contributions due to their   with the hemodynamic response function, and (iii) longer time series are able to capture a temporal average of the short-term dynamics, i.e., a stationary state. \n \nFunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive technique used to detect changes in magnetic susceptibility, which may correlate with oxygen consumption, and therefore with neural (synaptic) activity. The measured signal is termed Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD). \n  \nElectroencephalography is a non-invasive method routinely used to measure changes in voltage at the scalp, which can be originated by synchronous assemblies of neurons. EEG measures changes in voltage resulting from the flow of ions implicated in the generation of action potentials. While EEG can be measured with very high temporal resolution, it is difficult to pinpoint where in the brain the voltages originate. \n  \nBecause of the indirect nature of fMRI measurements, precisely localized neural activity (in the time domain) is measured by fMRI as widespread and lagged. Formally, neural activity time series are said to be convoluted, i.e., blurred by a moving average weighted by a kernel (in this case, the hemodynamic response function). The (difficult) operation of inverting this process is termed de-convolution. \n \nLeaving these assumptions aside, recent studies revealed meaningful changes in functional connectivity over time. Furthermore, the analysis of single volume co-activation patterns emerged ( ,  ), thus exploiting fMRI datasets up to the limit allowed by the temporal resolution of the BOLD response. However, many issues and limitations have to be considered regarding the interpretation of these findings:\n   \nAre temporal changes in connectivity related to respiration or heart rate fluctuations? Since fMRI measures blood flow, physiological changes could impact directly on BOLD measurements ( ). \n  \nAre temporal changes in connectivity related to head motion? It has been shown that movements inside the scanner can strongly influence connectivity estimates ( ). \n  \nDo apparent temporal changes in functional connectivity appear spuriously (by chance) or by meaningful neurophysiological fluctuations? Computation of short-term correlations between random noise signals can give rise to apparently complex dynamics ( ,  ). \n  \nAre changes in functional connectivity related to cognition or behavior or do they represent changes in vigilance and arousal? The question of how ubiquitous is sleep during the resting-state is closely related to this issue ( ). \n  \n\nIn this focused review we discuss how, when faced with such questions, the combination of fMRI with other neuroimaging methods (such as EEG and MEG) can help prove or disprove the neurophysiological relevance of dynamic changes in functional connectivity. This strategy was fundamental for validating the neurophysiological origin of spontaneous activity fluctuations in resting-state fMRI measurements ( ,  ) and its application to the field of dynamic functional connectivity may prove equally important. We will first review recent demonstrations of BOLD connectivity fluctuations and their relevance for understanding changes in behavior, cognition, and vigilance states, as well as alterations caused by brain diseases, while discussing the contribution of multimodal imaging to these topics. We will then review the role of multimodal recordings in understanding the different contributions to temporal changes in functional connectivity. \n\n\n## Functional Connectivity Fluctuates Over Time \n  \nExtensive reviews already cover with detail the recent developments in the field ( ,  ). Here we will only summarize selected results we deem important for the main topic of this review. A recent article also reviews the neural correlates of BOLD connectivity fluctuations and is a valuable complementary reading ( ). \n\nA natural starting point is the work of Chang and Glover ( ) and Sakoglu and colleagues ( ). The authors of the first study performed a time–frequency coherence analysis based on the wavelet transform and demonstrated time-varying connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) with the rest of the Default Mode Network (DMN) ( ). The use of   was also introduced to quantify correlations between BOLD signals over time. In the second study, authors also used time–frequency analyses to study dynamic functional connectivity changes during an auditory oddball task, as well as the differences between a group of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. In ( ) [and subsequently in Ref. ( )] non-overlapping windows were used to show that temporal dynamics of functional connectivity have an intrinsic burstiness, which is characteristic of critical phenomena. The use of sliding windows was applied to fMRI data from anesthetized monkeys (therefore reducing movement issues) in Hutchison et al. ( ). Of particular interest was the observation of periods of high (global) correlation, reminiscent of the global avalanches of activity observed in fMRI ( ), MEG ( ), and LFP data ( ). Dynamic functional connectivity was also established in rodents, with a temporal variation from positive to negative correlation except between homologous brain areas, which exhibit a predominantly positive correlation over time ( ). In humans, functional connectivity time courses were obtained (using sliding windows) between time series extracted from all regions in the Automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template ( ) and widespread correlations between direct electrophysiological recordings (EEG) and dynamic functional connectivity time series were found, as well as changes due to vigilance fluctuations ( ). This paper, as well as others applying similar multimodal approaches, will be discussed with more detail in the following sections. \n \nFunctional connectivity can be computed over a relatively short period or window of time (in the order of seconds for fMRI time series). In a sliding window analysis, this computation is repeated many times while displacing the window forward in time (either by one or many samples), therefore estimating temporal changes in functional connectivity. The window size and the overlap between windows are free parameters to be decided. \n \nAside from establishing the existence of fluctuations in functional connectivity, others attempted to evaluate whether short-term patterns of connectivity can be accurately classified or clustered into a discrete set of states. Clustering via k-means revealed short-term patterns of connectivity diverging from results obtained from whole recordings ( ), whereas PCA revealed stereotypical “building blocks” of short-term whole functional connectivity ( ). A more straightforward clustering of dynamic functional connectivity patterns was performed in ( ), in which all patterns between a set of four regions were enumerated. The limitation imposed on the number of regions allowed the explicit evaluation of information-theoretic quantities, which depend on sufficient sampling of the patterns visited over time. This method was then applied to characterize the temporal evolution of connectivity dynamics during the psychedelic state. \n\nMost of the analyses outlined above were carried out using sliding windows, basically an extension of standard linear correlation and therefore inheriting its bivariate nature. Higher order correlations, however, are ubiquitous in brain activity ( ) and a full understanding of transient connectivity states may not arise by considering pairwise interactions only. An exception is the extension of ICA to capture temporal independent modes ( ). Another exception is the study of instantaneous activations and co-activations of brain activity ( ). This approach is based on the identification of points of interest in resting-state data, which can be equivalently detected using blind de-convolution ( ) or by identifying extreme events in the data ( ). This multivariate approach reveals that co-activation patterns (i.e., all voxels containing an event or point of interest, which are concurrently observed in the same temporal volume) can reproduce all major Resting-State Networks (RSN) ( ) as observed with ICA, but with only a fraction of the data (approximately 4%). Clustering of co-activation maps converged toward the same result ( ). Recently, co-activation patterns of the PCC were used to assess dynamic changes during unconsciousness as induced by propofol ( ). \n\n\n## Behavioral and Cognitive Correlates of BOLD Connectivity Fluctuations \n  \nThe human brain is inherently dynamic and variable, with oscillations over different frequencies paralleling changes in brain states ( ). Non-static functional connectivity between BOLD time series is to be expected. However, it is important to understand how the intrinsic variabilities of brain activity and connectivity correlate with changes in behavior, cognitive states and environmental interactions. This is the next natural step in the investigation of dynamic functional connectivity and remains to be explored with detail. \n\nA relevant finding is the correlation between changes in functional connectivity of the DMN and stimulus-independent thought, as demonstrated in ( ). Authors performed resting-state fMRI recordings while intermittently probing mind wandering. Short-term functional connectivity of the DMN was obtained over 30 s. windows and a positive correlation between its temporal variance and an index of day-dreaming frequency was found during rest. This is an interesting example of how assessing the temporal variability of functional connectivity can assist in the interpretation of temporal variability in cognition and behavior. \n\nIn another study, spatiotemporal ICA was introduced to capture the temporal evolution of networks in task fMRI data ( ). This analysis (uninformed of task time courses and the regions involved) was able to capture the transitions between task and rest, suggesting a well-defined functional role for coupling fluctuations between regions. A similar blind analysis of dynamic connectivity changes associated with task performance was performed for EEG recordings ( ). \n\nOne natural question is whether spontaneous fluctuations in connectivity can bias perception and action. This question has an affirmative answer for the amplitude of BOLD signals. For instance, when showing ambiguous images to subjects (faces being one of two possible interpretations) researchers found that increased activity in the fusiform face area predicted the perception of the stimulus as a face ( ). How are cognition and behavior influenced by ongoing (de)synchronization of BOLD signals? One interesting possibility is the facilitation of conscious access during periods of transient “hypersynchronization” ( ) in fronto-parietal networks. It is known that conscious access elicits sustained neuronal responses propagating beyond sensory cortices and results in a massive synchronization of brain activity ( ,  ). A highly connected brain state could facilitate this propagation, thus predicting conscious perception of stimuli flashed at the threshold for awareness. This directly suggests an experiment that could be carried out to probe the relationship between transient global connectivity and perception (for instance, by adapting the experimental paradigm in ( ) allowing for enough time to estimate baseline functional connectivity prior to the presentation of the stimuli). \n\nMultimodal imaging (for instance, simultaneous EEG–fMRI recordings during rest) can offer insights on the functional role of spontaneous fluctuations in functional connectivity. A rich literature demonstrates how band-specific spontaneous changes in EEG oscillatory power can bias behavior and perception. Following the previous example, pre-stimulus gamma band in the lateral part of the occipital cortex can predict conscious awareness ( ). As discussed in the next section with more detail, a positive correlation between fronto-parietal BOLD connectivity and gamma power measured from occipital electrodes has been shown ( ). While indirect, these are first steps in the direction of establishing a relationship between transient patterns of large-scale functional connectivity and behavior, using EEG features as a bridge between these two. We note that direct experiments should be carried out to verify such relationships, for example, by probing how baseline functional connectivity can influence conscious perception [as suggested in the previous paragraph, by adapting the paradigm in Ref. ( ) and attempting to predict conscious perception from large-scale connectivity prior to the presentation of the stimuli]. \n\n\n## Changes in Functional Connectivity Over Time Track Brain States \n  \nIn line with the possibility of connectivity indexing fluctuations of attention and perception, we recently suggested that temporal changes of functional connectivity track more radical departures from wakefulness, i.e., toward drowsiness and sleep ( ). \n\nImplicit to the use of single connectivity estimates over extended resting-state sessions is the assumption that the brain state of subjects will be homogeneous and will not depart from an idealized “resting-state wakefulness.” While the existence of the latter is disputed (as subjects will naturally exhibit different thought patterns, levels of anxiety, attention, etc.), brain states associated with considerable neurophysiological changes (such as sleep) should be monitored and avoided. This is supported by many reports showing different BOLD functional connectivity and dynamics during drowsiness and sleep ( – ). \n\nDynamical changes in functional connectivity can be used to decode sleep stages [as defined by AASM rules ( )]. This was first validated using EEG–fMRI recordings during sleep ( ), furthermore, this classifier was then applied to fMRI resting-state studies acquired without simultaneous EEG to demonstrate the general pervasiveness of sleep during rest ( ). \n\nOne lesson of these studies is that temporal fluctuations in functional connectivity can be accounted (at least partially) by changes in vigilance levels and sleep stages. Vigilance shifts indeed occur during rest, therefore it is in the interest of researchers to maintain a steady brain state during fMRI acquisition (e.g., wakefulness) in order to avoid sleep-related confounds. This is of particular importance when comparing different clinical populations (it is known that neurological and psychiatric diseases are characterized by disturbances in sleep patterns ( ,  ) in addition to those caused by medication). \n\nArguably, loss of vigilance and sleep onset are not the only factors contributing to spontaneous fluctuations in functional connectivity. Instead, subtler changes in cognitive states can be decoded from connectivity patterns [see for instance the results in Ref. ( )]. Thus, understanding their prevalence during rest and confining analyses to particular cognitive states could reduce the possibility of false positives and negatives when comparing different populations (especially in a clinical context). \n\n\n## Alterations of Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Disease \n  \nFunctional connectivity reflects to a large extent the underlying structural connectivity of the brain ( ). Therefore, pathological alterations in the latter could be in principle detected by static functional connectivity analyses. It is also possible that pathological alterations in functional connectivity occur on a faster time scale and thus that averaging over many minutes obscures the differences. This could be the case for diseases associated with paroxysmal events, such as temporal lobe epilepsy and absence seizures. Indeed, dynamical changes in connectivity parallel the pre-ictal and post-ictal periods during absence seizures ( ) (suggesting an ictal inhibition of DMN connectivity) as well as inter-ictal spikes in temporal lobe epilepsy ( ). Increased temporal fluctuations of hippocampal connectivity in temporal lobe epilepsy likely reflect spike-induced variability ( ). These examples show the potential of simultaneous EEG–fMRI to integrate large-scale BOLD connectivity with faster information provided by EEG \n\nThe understanding of other diseases could benefit as well from analyses of dynamic changes in connectivity. In a recently published work, the short-term functional connectivity of schizophrenic patients ( ) was studied. Clustering of connectivity patterns revealed abnormalities in some transient states but not in others. Furthermore, transition probabilities between states were altered for schizophrenic patients, suggesting a different dynamical exploration of the repertoire of possible connectivity states. Future work using combined EEG–fMRI recordings should further characterize these abnormal transient states and their link to analogous electrophysiological features [such as EEG microstates ( ) and spectral changes]. \n\n\n## Correlations between Functional Connectivity and Band-Specific Oscillatory Power \n  \nA straightforward correlation between fMRI functional connectivity and an electrophysiological measure can be obtained from band-specific EEG power extracted from different topographical locations, which indexes the local synchronization of neurons at specific frequencies ( ). This was the approach followed in Ref. ( ), as well in Ref. ( ) and ( ). In the first study, widespread correlations between fMRI functional connectivity changes over time and EEG power were observed. These were positive for the gamma band (>40 Hz) and negative for slower frequencies including the alpha rhythm (8–12 Hz). This is in line with the hypothesized role of oscillations in these frequencies. Gamma frequency is linked to the binding of information between distant cortical areas (thus enhancing large-scale connectivity) ( ). On the other hand, the alpha rhythm has an inhibitory role, suppressing those connections that are irrelevant for the current demands ( ). The main limitation of this analysis is volume conduction in scalp EEG recordings, imposing limitations on the localization of EEG power fluctuations correlated with BOLD functional connectivity. Still, this is an important first step to establish the neurophysiological basis of dynamic functional connectivity. No correlations were found between dynamic functional connectivity and fluctuations in heart rate/respiration/head motion ( ). With respect to changes in vigilance, subjects drifting between wakefulness and light sleep showed a different pattern of correlations between dynamic functional connectivity and EEG. A positive correlation with the slower delta band (<4 Hz) and diminished positive correlations with the gamma band were found ( ). \n\nConsistent results were independently reported in Ref. ( ) and ( ). In the first paper, psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was applied to study the relationship between alpha power and connectivity of a region located in the occipital cortex. A negative correlation with alpha (but not with other bands) was found, which was also interpreted by the authors as inhibition by alpha oscillations. The second study reported a negative modulation (i.e., anticorrelation) of fMRI connectivity between the DMN and the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) with alpha power. The correlations between fMRI dynamic connectivity and EEG power fluctuations for these studies are shown in Figure  . \n  \n Three studies reporting an inverse correlation between BOLD functional connectivity fluctuations and power in the alpha (8–12 Hz) band in human subjects  .

(B)   Mean correlation values and statistical significance of the correlation between functional connectivity (all pairs in the AAL template) and power in different EEG frequency bands: central alpha/beta (negative correlations) and central/frontal gamma (positive correlations). Reproduced with permission from Ref. ( ).   (C)   Significance of correlation (in t-values) between time-varying functional connectivity and alpha (left) and theta (right) EEG power for 16 regions of interest. Reproduced with permission from Ref. ( ). \n  \nCorrelations between both functional connectivity and BOLD signal amplitude ( ) with EEG power in the alpha band can be reconciled given that simultaneously activated brain regions will be functionally connected when examined using very short window lengths. In other words, the shorter an observational window, the smaller will be the conceptual difference between co-activation and functional connectivity. It might be the case that correlating electrophysiological data with time-varying functional connectivity will yield a more meaningful fusion model than the direct correlation of EEG band power with the BOLD signal amplitude, the latter being a limiting case of the former. \n\nTo overcome the limitations of volume conduction, concurrent direct electrophysiological recordings and BOLD signals were obtained in the somatosensory cortex of rats ( ). The results diverge from those reported in humans ( ,  ) in the observation of positive correlations with all frequency bands, including the alpha and gamma bands. It must be noted that this work assessed interhemispheric correlations only. Differences could arise due to the presence of source mixing and volume conduction in EEG, absent when signals are recorded on-site via invasive electrodes. Finally, animal studies are usually performed under anesthesia whereas data from humans are commonly acquired during wakefulness, which could also explain the discrepancies. These results were partially concordant with those from another animal study (in this case in monkeys) in which a positive contribution of relatively slow (<20 Hz) LFP signals to BOLD connectivity was observed, but excluding a contribution from gamma ( ). Concurrent fMRI and intra-cranial electrophysiological recordings can contribute to understanding the divergences between animal and human studies. \n\n\n## Correlations between Functional Connectivity and Band-Specific Coherence \n  \nThe studies mentioned in the preceding section do not directly relate measures of electrophysiological synchronization (i.e., coherence) to BOLD functional connectivity between pairs of regions. For this purpose is necessary to source localize the EEG/MEG scalp sensor data, allowing more accurate estimation of the coordinates from where time series are extracted. To study the correlation between static BOLD functional connectivity and electrophysiological coherence is not necessary to perform simultaneous combined measurements, instead, both metrics can be obtained during two different offline recordings and subsequently correlated. This approach was followed by Brookes and colleagues ( ) using non-simultaneous MEG and fMRI data. Authors observed the strongest correlations when studying the beta band and when focusing on the sensorimotor cortex. A recent study overcame the limitations of offline measurements by combining simultaneous EEG–fMRI with beamforming for source localization ( ). Connectivity between time series was computed via the precision matrix (i.e., the inverse of the covariance matrix) and the inference of fMRI connectivity from EEG (and vice-versa) was assessed using sparse canonical correlation analysis combined with cross-validation. The inference of fMRI connectivity from EEG connectivity was better than the inverse (EEG from fMRI) across all bands, suggesting a loss of important information in the BOLD signal for the purpose of assessing connectivity. \n\n\n## Electrophysiological Correlates of fMRI Co-Activation Patterns \n  \nThe patterns observed in resting-state activity reflect to a large extent those observed during task execution and sensory stimulation. For instance, by analyzing resting-state fMRI data and fMRI activation maps from a large database (  BrainMap  ,  ) ( ) were able to show a striking correspondence between both sets of independent components (RSN and the BrainMap ICA). Furthermore, recent results show that these patterns do not arise only when averaged over extended scanning sessions but voxels also become spontaneously co-activated (i.e., their activity is jointly over a certain fixed threshold) at individual volumes ( ,  ). Thus, brain activity is a dynamic succession of activated/de-activated voxels and the patterns of spontaneous activations reproduce task-induced activations. This method for studying resting-state recordings resolves “instantaneous” (i.e., up to the temporal resolution of the BOLD response) and dynamic changes in co-activation. \n\nIt is yet necessary to establish the electrophysiological signatures of these spontaneous activation patterns. Besides the need to distinguish meaningful neuroelectrical activity from other confounds due to brain vasculature, head motion, etc., there is a rich history in cognitive neuroscience assigning band-specific frequencies and Evoked Reponse Potentials (ERPs) to particular tasks which, in turn, could be associated with these patterns of spontaneous co-activations. To the present day, average activity in RSN was linked to characteristic distributions of EEG frequencies ( ), but temporal signatures associated with particular patterns of instantaneous co-activations remain to be studied. Furthermore, a recent study reported temporally unstable correlations between EEG signals and RSN time series, which could arise due to an intermittent manifestation of these networks ( ). \n\nThe study of such correlations corresponds to an fMRI-informed EEG analysis, which is exactly the opposite of the most common strategy (i.e., using EEG as a regressor in the analysis of fMRI data). The main difficulty is the relative temporal imprecision of fMRI recordings, which complicates EEG analysis triggered by fMRI events. The improvement of fMRI sampling rates could reveal stable electrophysiological signatures of RSN in the temporal domain, by averaging temporal EEG data temporally locked to the spontaneous activation of different RSN. However, the use of scanning sequences with shorter TRs (e.g., multiband sequences) has intrinsic limitations (such as hemodynamic convolution and the possibility of heterogeneous hemodynamic coupling throughout the cortex). \n\n\n## Limitations and Caveats \n  \nTwo inter-related problems arise when studying temporal changes in BOLD functional connectivity. First, how to adequately define states which through their temporal progression can be used to characterize dynamics. Second, the problem of spurious results when sliding windows is used to obtain temporally evolving connectivity. \n\nDue to poor temporal sampling it is difficult to naturally divide an fMRI resting-state session into segments of different connectivity. Interesting advances have been made by means of different analytical methods [constrained matrix factorization ( ), automatic estimation of sliding window parameters using cross-validation ( ), variable parameter regression and Kalman filters ( )]. Since BOLD functional connectivity is correlated with band-specific EEG power fluctuations (which admit a better temporal characterization) ( ,  ), an interesting possibility is to use multimodal information to find the temporal scale at which BOLD connectivity fluctuations predominantly occur. This could be useful if, for instance, changes in connectivity were to arise mainly due to vigilance fluctuations. \n\nLacking a principled definition to identify temporal blocks of different connectivity, many authors have resorted to the use of sliding windows of fixed length. The second problem relates to spurious (non-biological) fluctuations in connectivity arising in this type of analyses. Recent work has shown that spurious changes in connectivity appear if the sliding window length is shorter than the largest period present in the signals ( ). Window lengths at least larger than the reciprocal of the minimum frequency of interest in the signal are recommended. Considering the frequencies relevant to the resting-state BOLD signal, window lengths in the range 30–60 s are recommended for typical acquisition parameters. Another consequence of using sliding windows is low-pass filtering of connectivity time courses (with a frequency cutoff equal to the reciprocal of the sliding window length). This means that the connectivity time course (i.e., the successive correlations estimated from sliding windows as they are moved in time) will not capture high-frequency connectivity fluctuations. When correlating dynamic BOLD connectivity with signals from other modalities [such as EEG power in Ref. ( )] it is important to also perform a windowed averaging of the data, ensuring that signals will have comparable frequency content. \n\n\n## Discussion and Outlook \n  \nIn this review we have discussed some of the main findings on multimodal imaging of dynamic functional connectivity and their implications. A number of studies converge toward widespread correlations between fluctuations in functional connectivity and EEG or LFP band-specific power, although with different results for animal and human studies, most notably, with absent negative correlations with the alpha band in animal studies (rats and monkeys). These studies may help assuage concerns about artifacts influencing changes in connectivity over time. They suggest a dynamical nature for the coupling between regions, which is a natural constraint for interacting with an equally dynamic world. Positive correlations with the gamma band and negative correlations with the alpha band give further support to this notion. While correlations with heart rate and respiration fluctuations were not directly observed, it is known that these can nevertheless be correlated with EEG power time series ( ), therefore their influence cannot be completely ruled out. \n\nThe correlation between BOLD functional connectivity and EEG synchronization measured between a pair of regions requires more sophisticated preprocessing, including source localization. Studies to date have not analyzed short-term, dynamically fluctuating connectivity but longer time series, either offline [with MEG, ( )] or with simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisition ( ). In this last study, it was observed that EEG connectivity could more accurately infer fMRI connectivity than vice-versa, raising the question of the necessity of fMRI measurements, provided accurate source localization from EEG or MEG data. Indeed, these imaging methods have many advantages over fMRI to quantify dynamic changes in connectivity, including the dissociation of band-specific contributions and the possibility of shorter temporal windows due to very high sampling rate. A main disadvantage is the relative inadequacy to resolve subcortical sources. There is also a rich literature on the large-scale organization of the human brain as measured with fMRI, since the study of large-scale patterns of brain activity (such as RSN) was pioneered using this methodology. This opens the way for the expansion of these results in a dynamical sense, but it is also important to combine these analyses with contributions from other imaging methodologies due to the reasons mentioned above. Finally, we note that even though fMRI data are poorly sampled (in the temporal sense), it is still capable to capture short-lived events as well as fast electrophysiological frequencies (such as gamma) ( ). \n\nGiven the limited temporal resolution of fMRI data, the study of single volume co-activation patterns is of substantial interest. At the core of this method is the realization that patterns appearing on average are also manifest “instantaneously” as groups of jointly activated voxels. The study of these patterns holds promise to map the spontaneous cognitive processes underlying the resting-state. The combination with simultaneous EEG could reveal signatures disentangling transient artifacts from real cognitive processes. Also, observing a correlation between different conscious contents and rapidly shifting patterns of co-activated regions could strengthen the observation that functional connectivity reflects mind wandering or day-dreaming ( ). \n\nWe want to note that simultaneous EEG–fMRI acquisition can pose difficult challenges [for detailed reviews see Ref. ( ,  )]. While advanced recording and preprocessing techniques can reduce EEG artifacts due to the time-varying magnetic fields of fMRI, a critical assessment of spurious residual EEG signals is always necessary. Therefore, simultaneous EEG–fMRI experiments should only be performed when absolutely necessary. \n\nIn summary, the reviewed articles show widespread evidence that: (i) functional connectivity fluctuates over time in short temporal windows, (ii) these fluctuations are neural in origin and paralleled by electrophysiological changes, and (iii) these electrophysiological correlates in humans are consistent with their purported role in binding/inhibitory processes. While some studies suggest that MEG and EEG are in general terms superior for tracking functional connectivity changes over time, the use of fMRI is still more common due to its ability to consistently map stable, high-resolution large-scale networks. Ideally, the advantages of both methods (and not their disadvantages) will be combined in the future to gain a deeper understanding of dynamic functional connectivity. \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"7cd7661f4c0ac64b29dfa73a6987e060"},

Static connectivity, in particular, has played a large part in guiding conclusions from the majority of resting-state functional MRI studies. However, accumulating evidence points to the presence of temporal fluctuations in FC, leading to increasing interest in estimating FC as a dynamic quantity. One central issue that has arisen in this new view of connectivity is the dramatic increase in complexity caused by dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) estimation. To computationally handle this increased complexity, a limited set of dFC properties, primarily the mean and variance, have generally been considered. Additionally, it remains unclear how to integrate the increased information from dFC into pattern recognition techniques for subject-level prediction. In this study, we propose an approach to address these two issues based on a large number of previously unexplored temporal and spectral features of dynamic functional connectivity. A Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is used to estimate time-varying patterns of functional connectivity between resting-state networks. Time-frequency analysis is then performed on dFC estimates, and a large number of previously unexplored temporal and spectral features drawn from signal processing literature are extracted for dFC estimates. We apply the investigated features to two neurologic populations of interest, healthy controls and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, and show that the proposed approach leads to substantial increases in predictive performance compared to both traditional estimates of static connectivity as well as current approaches to dFC. Variable importance is assessed and shows that there are several quantities that can be extracted from dFC signal which are more informative than the traditional mean or variance of dFC. This work illuminates many previously unexplored facets of the dynamic properties of functional connectivity between resting-state networks, and provides a platform for dynamic functional connectivity analysis that facilitates its usage as an investigative measure for healthy as well as abnormal brain function. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFunctional connectivity (FC) between intrinsic functional networks is of increasing interest for understanding the human brain. Recent work suggests that these networks are identifiable during tasks as well as during the task-free resting state [ – ]. Furthermore, evidence has consistently found that connectivity between these networks at rest is informative, not only with respect to normal variations in cognitive function such as memory [ ,  ], but also individual variations in abnormal and healthy brain function [ – ]. Several studies have indicated that the default mode network (DMN), which regulates introspective thought, is “anticorrelated” with other resting-state networks [ ,  ]. The nature of these resting-state network interactions is thought to play a large role in facilitating normal cognitive function [ ,  ]. \n\nUntil recently, however, the majority of resting-state functional connectivity studies have been based on static measures of connectivity, which rely on the inherent assumption that inter-regional signal associations are constant over the length of the scan. With the discovery that inter-regional signal associations fluctuate over time both within and across scanning sessions [ ,  ], increased attention has been paid towards understanding the dynamic properties of functional connectivity. Static measures of connectivity have been found to not fully reflect the temporal dynamics of connectivity [ ], with a significant degree of temporal variability in the degree of anticorrelation between the DMN and other resting-state networks [ ]. Further developments have found that the level of variability in dFC may itself be informative about brain function in normal aging [ ], as well as disorders such as schizophrenia [ ], major depressive disorder [ ], and temporal lobe epilepsy [ ]. However, current understanding of dFC is limited for several reasons. Firstly, the vast majority of analyses have utilized a sliding-window approach to estimate dynamic connectivity, which tends to produce artificial fluctuations in connectivity [ ]. Recently, some efforts have been made to separate dynamic fluctuations caused by true changes versus those caused by statistical uncertainty [ ,  ,  ]. Model-based approaches, such as Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models, were investigated by [ ] and found to provide more reliability than sliding-window approaches for dFC detection due to decreased sensitivity to parameter settings and susceptibility to noise. Secondly, the majority of studies have generally focused on a rather narrow set of characteristics of dFC temporal dynamics—typically the mean, variance, or number of state-to-state transitions in the time-domain. Recently, some studies have begun modeling dFC in the time-frequency domain using wavelet transform coherence [ ,  ]. These studies suggest that additional information may be gained by considering spectral properties such as the number of time-frequency points spent in various clustered states. However, beyond this small set of features, much remains unknown about the temporal and spectral characteristics of dFC. \n\nThe aims of this study are to (1) investigate previously unexplored temporal and spectral characteristics of dynamic functional connectivity between the DMN and several other commonly investigated resting-state networks; (2) examine which temporal/spectral aspects of dynamic functional connectivity are altered in temporal lobe epilepsy; and (3) propose a new approach for integrating estimates of dFC into pattern recognition techniques for subject-level prediction, using as a feature vector the temporal and spectral features of dFC. GARCH is first used to estimate dFC between the DMN and other resting-state networks. Next, dFC is transformed into the spectral domain using Welch’s power spectral density estimate. Temporal and spectral features drawn from signal processing literature are then computed for the estimated dFC and corresponding spectral density. Lastly, Random Forests is used to assess the predictive accuracy of the proposed method for identifying disease states. Our proposed approach of investigating dFC in terms of its temporal and spectral features elucidates many previously unexplored facets of the normal dynamics of functional connectivity in fMRI. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach provides an interpretable method for incorporating the new field of dFC into clinical outcome prediction on the individual subject level, which achieves superior performance compared to traditional estimates of the dFC variance or static connectivity. We illustrate our approach using connectivity between the default mode network and several commonly investigated resting-state networks in temporal lobe epilepsy. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants and ethics statement \n  \nParticipants consisted of 23 healthy controls (HC; average age, 31.1±6.5 SE (y); age range, 19-44 (y); 8 females) and 25 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE; average age, 33.6±7.8 SE (y); age range, 20-45 (y); 12 females; average epilepsy duration, 18.74±2.4 SE (y); epilepsy duration range, 2-39 (y)). Healthy control subjects had normal structural MRIs, no history of neurologic illness, and were not taking neurologic medications. All subjects were right-handed except four TLE patients. TLE patients were recruited from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Seizure Disorder Center. Diagnostic evaluation for all patients included video-EEG monitoring, high-resolution MRI, FDG-PET scanning, and neuropsychological testing. Written informed consent was obtained prior to scanning for all subjects in accordance with guidelines from the UCLA Institutional Review Board. The study protocol and consent procedure was approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board (IRB) #10-000568. A two-sample   t  -test with unequal variances and Fisher exact test showed no significant difference in age, gender, or handedness at the   α   = 0.05 level of significance. \n\n\n### Image acquisition and pre-processing \n  \nImaging was performed with a 3T MRI system (Siemens Trio, Erlangen, Germany). Functional imaging was performed with the following parameters: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, FOV = 210 mm, matrix = 64 × 64, slice thickness 4 mm, 34 slices. Subjects were instructed to relax with eyes closed during imaging, with concomitant EEG monitoring to confirm awake status. No auditory stimulus was present except for the acoustic noise from imaging. High-resolution structural images were obtained during the same imaging study with the parameters: TR = 20 ms, TE = 3 ms, FOV = 256 mm, matrix = 256 × 256, slice thickness 1 mm, 160 slices. The images were acquired in the axial plane using a spoiled gradient recalled (SPGR) sequence for the anatomical images and an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence for the functional images. The imaging sessions included multiple simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings, each lasting 5 to 15 minutes. The session with the least amount of motion was selected to include 10 to 15 minutes of BOLD fMRI data for each subject. To limit the influences of motion, image results were checked to ensure that no subjects had a maximum translation of > 1.5mm (HC, 0.24 ± 0.04 mm; TLE, 0.37 ± 0.04 mm). Patients remained on their regular medications during the fMRI. None of the patients had a seizure in the 24 hours preceding the imaging and none had seizures during the study as confirmed by the simultaneous EEG obtained during fMRI. The EEG results were not included in the data analysis other than to exclude seizures. Details of the simultaneous EEG methods have been described previously [ ]. \n\nNeuroimaging and fMRI pre-processing steps are similar to that described previously [ ]. Preprocessing was performed using FSL (fMRIB Software Library) version 5.0.7 (Oxford, United Kingdom,  ) [ ,  ] and included head movement artifact correction [ ], non–brain tissue elimination [ ], high-pass filtering (100 s), spatial smoothing at 5 mm full-width half-maximum, and mean-based intensity normalization as described previously for resting-state fMRI analyses [ ,  ]. Excessive head movement was corrected using motion scrubbing through nuisance regression. TRs that showed instantaneous changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) intensity that exceeded threshold (75th percentile + 1.5× interquartile range) were identified using FSL and added as single-timepoint nuisance regressors for motion censoring [ ]. The average number of identified outliers per participant was 4.11% ± 2.65%. Tissue-type segmentation was performed on each participant’s structural image using FAST (FMRIB’s Automated Segmentation Tool) [ ], before being aligned to their respective BOLD images. The first eigenvectors of the white matter signal and cerebrospinal fluid signal were obtained using the segmented masks. The following were included as temporal covariates and regressed out using linear regression: motion outliers, six motion parameters, white matter eigenvectors, cerebrospinal fluid eigenvectors, and their associated derivatives. Recent work suggests that, while resting-state networks are dominated by low-frequency fluctuations, the spectral range of resting-state networks contains meaningful information in spectral components up to and possibly beyond 0.25 Hz [ – ]. In the interest of capturing meaningful higher frequency information, a temporal low-pass filter was not applied to the data [ ]. Residuals were used in the seed-based correlation analysis below. \n\n\n### Extraction of resting-state networks \n  \nFunctional connectivity networks were extracted for several commonly studied resting-state networks using a seed-based analysis, including the motor, visual, memory, language, auditory, and default mode networks. Seed-based correlation and spatial independent component analysis (ICA) are two predominant methods used for extracting networks from fMRI data. While seed-based and ICA approaches have distinct strengths, they have been found to yield similar networks for resting-state networks such as the motor, visual, default mode, and attention networks [ ]. Seeds related to each network were defined   a priori   based on the literature as 6-mm spheres in MNI space ( ). For selected ROIs, bilateral seeds were created by mirroring the contralateral side of the seed and were subsequently merged. We also explored spheres with radii of 4-mm and 8-mm, and verified that the extracted networks were robust to radius size. These seeds were transformed from standard MNI space to each subject’s individual BOLD space. The mean time course of each seed was computed by averaging across all voxels within the seed and used as the dependent variable in a General Linear Model (GLM) as implemented by FSL’s FEAT, to obtain   Z  -statistic images.   Z  - (Gaussianized   T   or   F  ) statistic images were thresholded using clusters determined by   Z   > 2.0 and a (corrected) cluster significance threshold of   p   < 0.05. Positively correlated voxels were used to construct network maps [ ,  ,  ], which provided the final ROIs for dynamic connectivity analysis. Due to spatial overlap between networks, a winner-take-all approach was used in which overlapping voxels were assigned to the network with the greater correlation. The BOLD time-series within each session-wise network   Z  -map was extracted and averaged over all voxels in the session-wise network   Z  -map using a weighted average, with weights proportional to the degree of correlation with the seed voxel. The weighted approach allows for greater spatial homogeneity compared to nonweighted networks, while relaxing the constraint for spatial contiguity enforced by using the original spherical seeds as ROIs. Additionally, group analysis was performed to characterize the functional networks across all subjects ( ). \n   Resting-state connectivity patterns of resting-state networks across the whole group of subjects, overlaid in MNI space.  \nNetwork seed coordinates and descriptions are provided in  .

Estimates of dynamic functional connectivity are first obtained using a model-based approach to estimate dFC ( ). Although a GARCH model is employed here, other popular dFC estimation approaches, including sliding window techniques or other model-based approaches, could be used at this step. Next, the estimated dFC is transformed into the frequency domain using Welch’s method for spectral density estimation ( ). We extract temporal and spectral features of dFC from the resulting signal ( ). These temporal and spectral features of dFC are then concatenated and used within pattern recognition techniques ( ). In the following sections, we describe each of these steps in more detail. \n   Schematic of proposed framework for studying temporal and spectral characteristics of dynamic functional connectivity.  \n(a) Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) is first estimated from a model-based state-space approach. (b) dFC estimates are transformed to the spectral domain using Welch’s power spectral density estimate. (c) Temporal and spectral features are extracted from the temporal and spectral domains. (d) Temporal and spectral features are concatenated and (e) used as the feature vector for subject-level prediction. \n  \n\n### Dynamic Conditional Correlation Model \n  \nTo model dynamic functional connectivity between resting-state networks, we consider the Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model of [ ]. Let    Z    = (  Z  ,   Z  )′ be a random vector representing a pair of BOLD time series of any two ROIs in the brain at time   t  , for each of   i   = 1, …,   N   subjects. For simplicity, below we omit the index   i  . Although the methods described in the following sections may be applied to any choice of networks or regions, in this study we investigate dynamic functional connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and the commonly investigated resting-state networks shown in  , including the visual, language, auditory, motor, and memory networks. \n\nWe model the dynamic relationship between any pair of networks with the following process:\n \nIn our work we assume that an ARMA(2,2) mean process is consistent with our data. In particular we let each element of the mean vector   μ   to be defined as\n \nLjung-Box test and autocorrelation residual analysis were performed and confirmed our assumption regarding the mean process of the time series. Further, we let the covariance matrix associated with    ϵ    for each subject to be given by:\n \nwhere    D    = diag(  σ  ,   σ  ). \n\nThe correlation matrix    R    contains the correlation coefficient   ρ   representing the dynamic connectivity between two regions   Z   and   Z   for every subject   i  . For the conditional covariance we assume a GARCH-DCC process of order one:\n \nTo complete the DCC specification of the model we further let:\n \nwhere Ξ represents the unconditional correlation matrix of   u   and 0 <   η   +   η   < 1. \n\nThe estimation of the model parameters    λ    = (  α  ,   α  ,   β  ,   β  ,   θ  ,   θ  ,   ω  ,   ω  ,   ϕ  ,   ϕ  ,   ψ  ,   ψ  ) and the dynamic conditional correlations    R    are of interest. The likelihood function of the model can be written as:\n \nThe first three terms above involve only the variance and the last three only the correlation. Moreover, the variance terms of the likelihood can be estimated using a univariate GARCH model for each   Z  ,   j   = 1, 2. This motivates the use of a two-step procedure for the estimation of all parameters of the DCC-GARCH mode as discussed in [ ]. In the first step, a univariate GARCH model is fit to the two time series individually. The residuals are then used to estimate the parameters entering the correlation terms in  . \n\n\n### Feature extraction \n  \nThe majority of fMRI functional connectivity studies are currently based on static functional connectivity or the mean or variance of dynamic functional connectivity. Dynamic functional connectivity contains a large amount of information which may be of use in increasing the amount of signal extracted from fMRI connectivity analysis. However, direct usage of dynamic functional connectivity time-series estimates may not work well in machine learning for several reasons, including poor interpretability and noisiness of the raw time-series.   Feature engineering   provides a commonly employed approach in signal processing literature, in which domain knowledge is used to transform an otherwise noisy raw signal into simpler attributes with higher predictive power. \n\nHere, we use feature engineering to evaluate whether additional informative features can be extracted from dFC signal in addition to the traditionally employed mean and variance. To do so, we extract a large number of temporal and spectral features drawn from acoustic and EEG signal processing literature. Due to the usefulness of these features in acoustic and EEG analysis [ – ], we hypothesized that these features may also be useful for extracting information from dynamic functional connectivity. \n\n summarizes the dynamic functional connectivity features investigated. The computation of each feature is described in detail below (see   Temporal dFC features   and   Spectral dFC features   sections). As dynamic funtional connectivity is a still emerging area of research, the physiologic interpretation of many of these features is not yet known; however, motivating physiologic interpretations are also discussed below when known. \n   Temporal and spectral features of dynamic functional connectivity.  \nFeatures and abbreviations are shown. dFC, dynamic functional connectivity. \n    \nAll code was written in R version 3.1.3. R code to carry out implementation is available at the corresponding author’s website. \n\n\n### Temporal dFC features \n  \nStatic connectivity measures the average value of the statistical dependence between two time-series over a given time period [ ]. To capture this, the   mean value   (MV) of the estimated dynamic functional connectivity was computed for every subject, defined as the average magnitude of the dynamic functional connectivity. Based on recent observations that the variance in dFC may also be informative about brain function [ ,  ,  ], we also compute a   variance   (VAR) feature which is calculated as the unbiased sample variance of dFC:\n \n\nThe mean value and variance of dFC have typically been considered in dFC research. To examine whether additional information is present in dFC signal that can improve prediction, we examine additional temporal and spectral quantities previously unexplored in dFC research. Two additional time-domain features of dFC were considered: (a)   proportion of anticorrelated volumes   (PAV), which is defined as the proportion of time points for which dFC is negative in sign, capturing the degree of “anticorrelation” between networks, and (b)   zero-crossing rate   (ZC), which provides a measure of the rate at which dFC changes signs (e.g. from positive to negative and vice versa). The mathematical definitions for PAV and ZC for the   i  th subject are given in equations Eqs ( ) and ( ), where   1   is an indicator function equal to 1 if   R   < 0, and 0 otherwise:\n \nwhere   R   is the estimated dynamic functional connectivity for subject   i   at time point   t  , as described above (see   Dynamic Conditional Correlation Model  ), and the threshold   c   was included in   in order to avoid signal crossings due to low-level noise. Here, we set   c   = 0.001. \n\n\n### Spectral dFC features \n  \nWelch’s method [ ] was used to obtain power spectra of the estimated dynamic functional connectivity. We investigate the utility of several spectral features for dFC analysis. To capture the distributional properties of the power spectra, we examined the first four spectral central moments of dFC, including the (a)   spectral centroid   (SCO), which measures the center of mass of the dFC spectrum, with higher values indicating greater energy concentrated at higher frequencies; (b)   spectral spread   (SPR), which measures the bandwidth of the dFC spectrum; (c)   spectral skewness   (SKW), which measures the symmetry of the power spectral density, with positive (negative) values indicating positive (negative) skewness; and (d)   spectral kurtosis   (KURT), which measures the distribution of frequencies around the spectral centroid, with higher values indicating dFC frequencies more highly clustered around the spectral centroid. Definitions are provided in Eqs ( )–( ):\n \nHere,   M   and   f   are the magnitude of the spectra at frequency bin   k   and the frequency of bin   k  , respectively, for subjects   i   = 1, …,   N  . In addition, we examined the   median frequency   (SMED), or the frequency at which the power spectrum is divided into two regions with equal amplitude. The median frequency and the spectral centroid are both measures of the central tendency of the spectral distribution. However, estimated values of SMED are less affected by random noise. The definition of SMED is given in  :\n \nThe   spectral rolloff   (SRO), a measure of the right-skewness of the power spectra, was also computed. SRO is the frequency below which 85% of the spectral distribution magnitude is concentrated, as given in  :\n \nwhere SRO  is the rolloff frequency. \n\nSeven other features in the frequency domain were considered: (a)   dominant frequency   (PEAK), which is the dominant frequency of dFC oscillations, calculated as the peak with the largest average power in its bin [ ]; (b)   spectral crest   (CREST), which measures the peakiness of the power spectral density; (c)   spectral flux   (FLUX), which measures the rate of change of the power spectrum; (d)   spectral slope   (SLOPE), which is the tendency for the signal to have less energy at higher frequencies, calculated through linear regression of Welch’s estimate for the magnitude spectrum on the frequencies; (e)   spectral flatness   (FLAT), which is a measure of the noisiness of the dFC magnitude spectrum and is calculated as the ratio between the geometric and arithmetic means; (f)   power spectral entropy   (PSE), which is calculated as the information entropy of the dFC power spectrum, with small values of PSE indicating a narrow spectral peak and large values indicating a more smooth spectral peak; and (g)   amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in dFC   (ALFF-dFC), which is a measure of the energy of the dFC in the low-frequency range. ALFF-dFC is a derivation of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) [ ], which was originally proposed as an index for fluctuations in BOLD intensity in given regions of the brain. Similar to ALFF, we computed ALFF-dFC as the square root of the power spectrum of dFC, averaged across the low frequency range of 0.01–0.08 Hz. The mean of the derived   R   was removed prior to estimating the power spectrum for features for which a peak at the zero frequency was not informative about the feature of interest (PEAK, ALFF-dFC). \n\n\n### Temporal and spectral features of dFC in healthy controls and temporal lobe epilepsy patients \n  \nWe investigated differences in each of the above dynamic functional connectivity features between TLE and healthy controls.   provides a simulation study to characterize the ability of the features to capture the true dynamic connectivity. Further details can be found in the supplementary material. \n\nTo compare each dynamic functional connectivity feature between healthy controls and TLE, confidence intervals for the difference in means were estimated through bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals. The BCa procedure is a nonparametric approach for estimating confidence limits from a bootstrap distribution, which is used to estimate confidence intervals in data in which the underlying distribution is unknown. The BCa approach improves coverage accuracy over the standard percentile interval approach for bootstrap confidence intervals by accounting for two additional parameters: a bias-correction factor, which estimates the median bias of statistic, and an acceleration factor which estimates the rate of change of the standard error of the statistic with respect to the true parameter [ ]. The bootstrap distribution of the sample difference in means for each feature was drawn through the ordinary nonparametric bootstrap with 1000 resamples. Significant differences were identified through BCa bootstrap confidence intervals, with false discovery rate (FDR) control at the 0.05 level to correct for multiple comparisons [ ]. Corresponding corrected   p  -values are also provided. \n\n\n### Dynamic connectivity and class prediction \n  \nNext, we investigate the utility of the proposed features for improving disease prediction using dynamic functional connectivity. Temporal and spectral features are highly collinear, rendering prediction using traditional regression methods ill-posed. Therefore, we used the classifier Random Forests (RF) [ ] to perform simultaneous variable selection and subject-level prediction. We assume a two-class classification problem (TLE versus healthy controls), with temporal and spectral features of the estimated dynamic functional connectivity as predictor variables   X  , where   i   = 1, …,   N   indexes subjects and   j   = 1, …,   p   indexes the temporal and spectral dFC features described above. Let   y   denote the disease class of subject   i  . The Random Forest algorithm proceeds by generating a sequence of weak learners, such as decision trees, on bootstrapped samples of the data. Each tree is built based on a random subset of the features. More specifically, if we let   G  (  X  ), for   m   = 1,…,  M   trees, be a sequence of learners, then the final prediction of the Random Forest algorithm is obtained by combining all learners via:\n \nFive-fold cross-validation was used to assess the predictive performance of all temporal and spectral features. Random Forest parameters were optimized within each training set using a two-dimensional grid search to minimize cross-validated error. \n\nTo assess the relative contribution of the proposed dFC features for differentiating TLE from healthy controls, relative importance was quantified through variable importance scores. In particular, the conditional variable importance estimation procedure of [ ] was used due to the inter-subject correlation structure observed between features (sample correlation matrix shown in  ). To better assess predictive performance and provide more stable estimates of variable importance, repeated 5-fold cross-validation over thirty replications was used. \n   Pearson correlation heatmap of dFC features for DMN-memory network connectivity.  \nRed indicates positive correlations; blue indicates negative correlations.

Repeated 5-fold cross-validation was used to compare predictive accuracy using our approach to predictive accuracy using static connectivity. To investigate the additional information added by including dynamic features compared to static functional connectivity alone, we compared to predictive performance of a Random Forests classifier trained on Pearson correlation estimates of static functional connectivity (sFC-RF). For reference, performance using static functional connectivity under a logistic classifier is also shown (sFC). Lastly, we compared to predictive performance using the approach more commonly employed currently in dFC analysis, based on the mean and variance of sliding window dynamic functional connectivity, including (a) the mean of dynamic functional connectivity (SW-Mean), (b) the variance of dynamic functional connectivity (SW-Var), and (c) the mean and variance of dFC combined (SW-MeanVar). Allen and colleagues (2014) studied varying window sizes and overlap for estimating dynamic functional connectivity and found that window sizes of 30s to 2min have little effect on functional dynamics [ ]. Here, a sliding window size of 80s with 50% overlap was used. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Resting-state network differences in dynamic functional connectivity \n  \nOur approach was applied to two populations of interest in brain connectivity research, healthy controls and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.   shows the estimated dynamic functional connectivity, dFC power spectra, and estimated temporal/spectral dFC features for connectivity between the DMN and memory network for two sample TLE patients. \n   Estimated dynamic functional connectivity, power spectra, and dFC features for connectivity between the DMN and memory network for two sample patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.  \n(a) original BOLD time-series, (b) estimated dynamic functional connectivity and dFC power spectra, and (c) estimated dFC features.

The largest number of significantly altered characteristics of dFC was found for connectivity between the DMN and memory network. Connectivity between the DMN and memory network in TLE patients differed significantly from controls with respect to the zero-crossing rate (  p   = 0.008), power spectral entropy (  p   < 0.001), proportion of anticorrelated volumes (  p   < 0.001), spectral roll-off (  p   = 0.014), spectral centroid (  p   = 0.008), spectral median (  p   = 0.045), spectral spread (  p   < 0.001), spectral skewness (  p   = 0.008), spectral kurtosis (  p   = 0.03), spectral flatness (  p   < 0.001) and spectral crest (  p   < 0.001). Connectivity between the DMN and visual network was significantly different in TLE with respect to the variance of dFC (  p   < 0.001) and spectral flux (  p   = 0.045). Connectivity between the DMN and language network was significantly different for the mean value of dFC (  p   < 0.001) and proportion of anticorrelated volumes (  p   < 0.001).

For more details on between-network differences, we refer the readers to the Supplementary Material. \n\n\n### Prediction of disease status with proposed dFC features \n  \n compares predictive performance using the proposed approach to prediction using static functional connectivity (e.g., the Pearson correlation) and prediction based on the mean and/or variance of dFC. To provide a baseline for comparison, the null rate based on a naïve classifier is also shown (horizontal line). We found that our approach provides higher predictive accuracy for the DMN/memory and DMN/visual networks compared to static functional connectivity as well as traditional methods (e.g. the first two moments of dynamic functional connectivity). Compared to static connectivity, our approach obtains 11% and 31% higher accuracies in differentiating TLE patients from healthy controls using connectivity between the DMN/memory and DMN/visual networks, respectively. For the DMN/motor, DMN/auditory, and DMN/language networks, equivalent predictive performance was observed. Connectivity between the DMN and motor networks was found to be uninformative for discriminating TLE from healthy controls, with no added improvement over the null rate based on a naïve classifier. \n   Predictive performance of dFC features.  \nClassification accuracy (TLE vs. controls) based on connectivity between DMN and various resting-state networks is shown. The horizontal line indicates the performance of a naïve classifer. The naïve classifer provides a baseline level of performance and classifies all test samples as the most common class in the training set. Static functional connectivity (sFC; cyan), dFC mean (SW-Mean; purple), dFC variance (SW-VAR; gray), dFC mean and variance (SW-MeanVar; green), static functional connectivity with random forests (sFC-RF), and proposed dFC approach (GARCH-RF; red). Mean and 95% CI over thirty replicates are shown. \n  \nThe conditional variable importance score of each proposed dFC feature for discriminating TLE from healthy controls is shown in  . These scores estimate the contribution of each dFC feature for subject classification based on mean decrease in accuracy. The mean value and variance of dFC, two quantities which have been considered most commonly to date in dFC investigations, were found to have relatively high levels of variable importance across most networks (black and dark gray bars). This result corroborates the importance of static connectivity and the variance of dFC in connectivity research to date. However, as shown in  , several other features of connectivity contained a significant amount of FC signal in discriminating disease groups. In particular, for the network interactions for which our method resulted in higher predictive accuracy (DMN-MEM and DMN-VIS), several features had higher variable importance than the mean or variance of dFC. In the DMN-VIS network interaction, the variance (VAR) of dFC was found to be the most important feature. However, as   shows, the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF-dFC) contained a larger amount of signal than the mean value (MV). For DMN-VIS interactions, the mean value, which is a measure analogous to static connectivity, was in fact identified as a poor predictor of DMN-VIS connectivity differences between TLE and HC. \n   Conditional variable importance scores of dFC features.  \nMean of Random Forest conditional variable importance scores over 30 replicates, for dFC features between DMN and various resting-state networks.

We show that a number of unexplored temporal and spectral dFC features exist, which are useful for understanding the dynamics of functional connectivity and may have utility in increasing the sensitivity of future connectomic analyses. Our feature engineering approach provides an interpretable way to capture the complex information present in dFC and integrate this information into subject-level prediction, which provides deeper insight into the specific aspects of dynamic functional connectivity that are altered in disease pathology. We estimate normal levels of the proposed dFC features in healthy controls and in temporal lobe epilepsy patients, which allows for insight into which particular aspects of dFC are abnormal in TLE resting-state networks. In our application of this framework to temporal lobe epilepsy, we show that there are several dFC characteristics other than the traditionally considered mean and variance which are abnormal in epilepsy. We show that inclusion of these features into machine learning may permit increased sensitivity for disease detection. \n\nOur observation that intrinsic functional networks differ with respect to specific features of dFC suggests that the features proposed in our work may have potential clinical utility in delineating areas of cortex associated with specific tasks. This is a task which is of interest in applications such as epilepsy presurgical planning. Task-based fMRI has traditionally been used for this purpose, with newer methods utilizing seed-based cross-correlation analysis to identify areas of eloquent cortex such as the sensorimotor or language networks. Cross-correlation approaches typically rely on estimates of static connectivity, computed based on the Pearson correlation, to produce projected network maps. Although such methods have worked well for delineation of sensorimotor cortex, fMRI studies have historically reported poor positive predictive value for delineating language cortex [ ,  ]. Generation of feature maps based on this expanded set of dFC features may allow for more accurate delineation of these functional networks and is a potentially exciting topic of future investigation. \n\nOur proposed approach to dFC is novel in the respect that we investigate a large number of previously unexplored quantities in dFC between intrinsic functional networks. This is in contrast to previous studies, which have typically focused on the first- and second-order moments of dFC fluctuations. Previous work has found that static functional connectivity and the variability of dynamic fluctuations [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ] elucidate pathology in neurological disorders such as temporal lobe epilepsy. Our study corroborates the reliability of the mean and variance for FC characterization, by showing that these features often capture a large amount of the signal which is useful in discriminating patient groups. \n\nAlthough our results confirm the importance of the mean and variance of dFC in signal processing, our examination of variable importance scores shows that limiting dFC assessment to only these features may ignore information present in dFC fluctuations that may potentially increase the accuracy of dFC in machine learning. The physiologic implications of these features and how group differences between patients with epilepsy and healthy subjects relate to brain function is of great interest. It is thought that flexibility in cognitive processing, such as that required by higher-order association cortices, results from the ability of regions to exhibit more dynamic variability over different network configurations [ ,  ]. Supporting this hypothesis, homotopic regions (corresponding regions in opposite hemispheres) have been found to have the lowest variability in connectivity, followed by regions within sensory and motor networks, with the greatest amount of variability between higher-order network nodes [ – ]. Regions with bidirectional anatomical projections generally exhibit more stable FC (e.g., lower variance), followed by those with unidirectional anatomical connectivity and those with no direct anatomical connectivity [ ]. Due to the still emerging nature of dynamic functional connectivity, however, the physiologic meaning of the large majority of these features, such as why functional connectivity may fluctuate at a particular dominant frequency, is still unknown. To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate these features in functional connectivity data, and provides evidence that these features may contain useful information. Distinct EEG signatures have been found to correlate with fMRI dFC states [ ], and further investigation using electrophysiologic data is of interest for illuminating underlying neurophysiological correlates. \n\nPatients with temporal lobe epilepsy often report cognitive deficits with working memory and declarative memory [ – ]. Current research has found reduced static functional connectivity between the mesial temporal lobes and the posterior DMN in temporal lobe epilepsy, with worse memory performance correlating with more severe alterations in static functional connectivity [ ,  ]. Consistent with previous studies, we found the mean value of dFC between the DMN and memory network to have high variable importance in discriminating TLE from controls. This supports the clinical relevance of our approach, and connects our results with previous research which have found replicable differences using static connectivity. However, groupwise comparison of TLE and controls in our study demonstrates the interesting finding that a number of other unexplored spectral aspects of connectivity between the DMN and memory network are abnormal in TLE, including decreased levels of the zero-crossing rate, spectral roll-off, spectral centroid, spectral median, spectral spread, spectral flatness, power spectral entropy, and proportion of anticorrelated volumes; and increased levels of the spectral skewness, spectral kurtosis, and spectral crest. The zero-crossing rate, spectral centroid, and spectral median characterize different aspects of the frequency at which FC fluctuates; for example, the zero-crossing rate measures the rate at which dFC changes signs, while the spectral centroid and spectral median characterize the center of the dFC power spectrum, with smaller spectral centroids/medians indicating that the power spectrum is concentrated at a lower frequency. The spectral roll-off, spectral spread, spectral flatness, power spectral entropy, spectral kurtosis, and spectral crest are different measures of the variability of different frequencies involved in dFC. Taken together, therefore, the alteration in these features suggests that the frequency at which FC between the DMN and memory networks fluctuates in TLE is abnormal, and specifically involves fluctuations at overall lower frequencies and with less variability. As discussed above, less dynamic variability around network configurations may result in decreased flexibility for higher-order cognitive processing [ ,  ], and may explain the memory deficits commonly reported by patients with TLE. Additionally, we find that the levels of anticorrelation between the DMN/memory network and between the DMN/language network, estimated based on the proportion of anticorrelated volumes (PAV), are significantly lower in TLE than in healthy controls. As anticorrelation between resting-state networks is increasingly recognized to play a role in facilitating normal cognitive function [ ,  ], the PAV feature proposed may provide a useful marker for measuring anticorrelation in future dFC studies. Furthermore, we show that inclusion of these additional features into machine learning allows for more accurate discrimination of disease status in TLE. \n\nInterestingly, we found that temporal and spectral characteristics of the connectivity between the DMN and resting-state networks involving the temporal lobe, such as the memory and language networks, achieved the highest accuracy in discriminating temporal lobe epilepsy patients from healthy controls. This concurs with previous imaging research, which has most strongly implicated memory and language networks as aberrant in TLE [ ], and suggests that connectivity between the DMN and memory and language networks may be more severely affected in TLE. Previous research also indicates that connectivity involving less classically involved networks, such as the visual network, may also aberrant in TLE [ ], a finding which is supported here by the relatively high predictive accuracy that our approach attained using visual network connectivity. The improvement in predictive performance may be due to increased sensitivity of dynamic functional connectivity estimates to pathological inputs from other areas or cognitive processes. For example, although temporal lobe epilepsy may not directly affect the occipitally located visual network, inputs from the temporal lobe to the visual network are likely abnormal compared to that of a healthy control. Our study suggests that, while static connectivity estimates may not be sensitive to detecting abnormal inputs from other areas or cognitive processes, the added information provided by including features of dynamic connectivity may allow for improved detection of responses to these abnormal inputs. \n\n### Limitations and future work \n  \nAlthough the properties of DCC-GARCH models have been studied and found to outperform current approaches for estimating dFC, particularly in data with no true correlation between time courses or with slowly varying temporal fluctuations [ ], some sensitivity to noise is expected in all dynamic connectivity fMRI analysis due to the relatively limited number of sample time points [ ]. Reduction of non-neural sources of noise, such as scanner drift, head motion, and non-neural physiologic signal is therefore critical in these analyses. However, even with denoising, a residual level of noise inevitably remains, and further progress in dynamic connectivity is likely to benefit highly from developments in fMRI preprocessing [ ]. Additional variability is likely introduced by the use of a two-stage process to estimate dFC features, in which a single point estimate of    R    is obtained and conditioned upon to estimate feature values. Two-step statistical approaches generally cause loss of information in the use of a point estimate to summarize the dynamic functional connectivity, which in turn introduces random variability in downstream estimation of dFC features. Bayesian approaches, which allow for hierarchical modeling to avoid the use of two-step processes, provide a potential solution. Methods for bootstrapping the original time-series [ ] provide an alternative approach. However, while such approaches capture the variability in dFC estimates, these methods lead to computational challenges which limit the applicability of our approach to data in which large numbers of ROIs are of interest. For example, in order to accurately represent the distribution of the group means, a large number of bootstrap samples are necessary. Since for each bootstrapped time-series a DCC-GARCH model must be fit, selection of the order of the mean (ARMA) process and the covariance (GARCH) process through manual inspection of each individual bootstrapped time-series is not feasible. Automatic procedures for selecting the order of the mean and covariance process exist, but introduce their own limitations and must be weighed against potential benefit. While outside the scope of this study, these factors should be taken into consideration when interpreting results from dynamic analysis. \n\nThe framework for quantifying dynamic functional connectivity described in this paper, while examined in the context of resting-state fMRI, is broadly applicable to other electrophysiological modalities such as EEG or magnetoencephalography (MEG). The physiologic interpretation of the proposed dynamic connectivity features is intriguing and requires further investigation with EEG or MEG. Although fMRI provides the advantage of higher spatial resolution, its basis for studying neuronal activity is based on the hemodynamic response as an indirect measure of neuronal metabolism, and is potentially affected changes in blood flow induced by non-neuronal physiological processes such as cardiac and respiratory function. Future research may potentially benefit from improvements in signal by incorporating data on physiological processes. As shown in the present study, the subset of which particular temporal or spectral features are affected by different disease processes is a reflection of and may be informative about the underlying disease process, potentially analogous to the relationship of EEG slowing to pathology or PET hypometabolism to decreased neuronal activity. Applications to larger samples of healthy controls may also be useful for understanding the origin of these features. \n\nAs discussed in the   Dynamic Conditional Correlation Model   section, the evolution of dynamic connectivity is modeled in this work as a DCC-GARCH process of order one. If there is evidence of the presence of a long memory process in dynamic functional connectivity, an extension to higher orders is possible. Although no deviations from the weak stationarity assumption were observed for the current data, further investigation into the effects of such deviations on dynamic connectivity estimates might be of interest. Future work may also wish to explore a stochastic evolution of the covariance matrix rather than the deterministic assumption inherent in all GARCH type models. Although preliminary analyses comparing spectra between initial and later volumes did not suggest evolution of spectral properties over time, further extensions to allow for changing spectral properties within the scan [ ] are possible within this context. \n\nFuture work may also benefit from investigation of connectivity involving higher-frequency fMRI BOLD fluctuations. In this work, fMRI volumes were collected using a TR of 2000 ms, a common sampling rate in resting-state fMRI studies. Consequently, dynamics in this study reflect connectivity between BOLD fluctuations at a maximum frequency of 0.25 Hz. Some recent research suggests that common resting-state networks emerge at frequencies even up to 1.4 Hz, and that higher frequencies may also contain meaningful information about resting-state networks [ ]. The hemodynamic response that produces BOLD signal has a long time decay over seconds, rendering fMRI insensitive to shorter duration (higher frequency) activity. Additional work is needed to understand the additional information about dynamic connectivity that may be gained by sampling at higher frequencies. \n\nAdditional limitations of the approach utilized here suggest avenues for future work. In the present work, we focus on dynamic connectivity between the DMN and several commonly examined resting-state networks in resting-state fMRI. However, it is important to note that the proposed framework is applicable to the connectivity between any choice of regions, including connectivity between voxels, regions, or other resting-state networks. Further insight may be obtained by investigating the properties of dynamic connectivity under networks extracted through other commonly employed methods. Although seed-based correlations and ICA have been found to yield similar networks [ ], results are similar but not identical. There are various advantages and disadvantages to each approach, including the advantage of spatially orthogonal components in ICA, a constraint which is not enforced in seed-based analysis, but the disadvantage of the need to specify the number of components in ICA. Comparison to an ICA-based approach for network extraction would be useful and is of interest in future replicability studies. \n\n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"51cc4211fdb6397994ec2c6b7f84732d"},

However, a typical sliding window plus clustering (SWC) approach for analyzing dFNC models the system through a fixed sequence of connectivity states. SWC assumes connectivity patterns span throughout the brain, but they are relatively spatially constrained and temporally short‐lived in practice. Thus, SWC is neither designed to capture transient dynamic changes nor heterogeneity across subjects/time. We propose a state‐space time series summarization framework called “statelets” to address these shortcomings. It models functional connectivity dynamics at fine‐grained timescales, adapting time series motifs to changes in connectivity strength, and constructs a concise yet informative representation of the original data that conveys easily comprehensible information about the phenotypes. We leverage the earth mover distance in a nonstandard way to handle scale differences and utilize kernel density estimation to build a probability density profile for local motifs. We apply the framework to study dFNC of patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy control (HC). Results demonstrate SZ subjects exhibit reduced modularity in their brain network organization relative to HC. Statelets in the HC group show an increased recurrence across the dFNC time‐course compared to the SZ. Analyzing the consistency of the connections across time reveals significant differences within visual, sensorimotor, and default mode regions where HC subjects show higher consistency than SZ. The introduced approach also enables handling dynamic information in cross‐modal and multimodal applications to study healthy and disordered brains. \n  \nWe proposed a novel method for analyzing dynamic functional connectivity via extracting high‐frequency texture from the connectivity space.

The decomposition of brain images into meaningful independent components (ICs) and generating biomarkers helps analyze SZ to a greater extent (Calhoun, Liu, & Adalı,  ; Du et al.,  ; Erhardt et al.,  ; Liang et al.,  ; Rahaman et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ). Nevertheless, to reason about the neuropsychiatric disorders and studying the brain remains challenging because of the heterogeneous nature of these diseases (Alnæs et al.,  ; Tsuang, Lyons, & Faraone,  ). Thus, studies employ subgrouping/clustering of the subjects to minimize the dissimilarity in the population and make the investigation more viable (Luchins, Weinberger, & Wyatt,  ; Rahaman et al.,  ; Scarr et al.,  ). The human brain is considered an interconnected dynamical system with real‐time interaction between different nodes of the brain network (Bassett & Sporns,  ; Betzel & Bassett,  ). These dependencies among the neuronal populations or brain regions are described as functional connectivity (FC) and generally computed using Pearson correlation of time courses (TCs) in task‐based or resting‐state functional magnetic resonance Imaging (fMRI) (Buckner, Krienen, & Yeo,  ; Power et al.,  ). Recent empirical evidence has suggested that this dynamic spatiotemporal configuration better models brain activities and network organization (Liu et al.,  ; Ma et al.,  ; Sakoğlu et al.,  ; Vergara et al.,  ; Zhi et al.,  ). Studies have hypothesized that SZ is a disorder of disrupted cognition, network dysconnectivity, and lack of functional integration (Friston & Frith,  ; Lynall et al.,  ; Stephan, Baldeweg, & Friston,  ). Moreover, not all cognitive processes occur within a single brain component, instead of requiring dynamic reconfiguration of neural resources such as the brain network's nodes and connections (Alavash, Tune, & Obleser,  ; Petersen & Sporns,  ). As such, research into the brain's static and dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC), in which nodes are distributed maps, for example, IC maps, may provide crucial insights into functional integration and its disorder due to a heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorder such as SZ. \n\ndFNC is defined as the temporal interdependence among intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) extracted from independent component analysis (ICA) (Allen et al.,  ; Jafri et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ). dFNC study provides an ability to track time‐varying transitions in connectivity strength, thus moving beyond the limiting assumption of a single static connectivity pattern (Rashid et al.,  ; Vergara et al.,  ). However, a typical dFNC analysis assumes fixed discrete states with varying occupancy over time and does not capture continuous transient information. Studies often analyze dFNC through connectivity states and estimate those states via clustering the windowed FNC sliding across time (Miller et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ; Saha et al.,  ). The obtained states essentially fuse all homogenous connectivity patterns ignoring their order and timing. Additionally, these states explore connectivity patterns that span throughout the brain and prevail for a longer timescale. In practice, connectivity signatures are more spatially constrained and exist at a shorter timescale (Grandjean et al.,  ; Hilger et al.,  ; Liao et al.,  ; Miller et al.,  ). That is, transformations manifest over a slower timescale, and dynamics can adjust functional network topology accordingly (Aine et al.,  ; Bullmore & Sporns,  ). So, these methods are less suitable for capturing dynamic changes in the dFNC TC. Specially, those which manifest over a short and continuous timescale. Consequently, the methods also incompetent to analyze dynamic properties of dFNC, such as synchronizability and intermittent connectivity, which are also affected by neuropsychiatric disorders like SZ (Siebenhühner et al.,  ; Yu et al.,  ). \n\nAddressing the shortcomings of the existing methods, an increasing number of recent studies have started to investigate connectivity time series in a reformed timescale through bipartitions (Sporns et al.,  ) or network dynamics (Esfahlani et al.,  ; Faskowitz et al.,  ; Morioka, Calhoun, & Hyvärinen,  ; Sporns et al.,  ). We further advance this agenda by introducing a robust approach to decompose FC into a more granular scale by tracking the most recurring patterns of the dFNC TC. To capture brief, repetitive co‐fluctuations, we focus on the time‐series “motif”—a previously unknown but recurring time‐series pattern (Lin et al.,  ). In data mining, time series motifs as such signatures are deemed powerful tools for modeling and analyzing dynamical systems (Mueen,  ; Torkamani & Lohweg,  ). The dFNC TC represents the link between a pair of nodes during a time interval; intuitively, we are interested in the frequently occurring behavior of the signal rather than a few sporadic episodes. Motif extraction from each connection of FC can easily yield an extensive collection of variable‐length shapes even for a moderate connectivity dataset. A comprehensive collection of samples dramatically complicates the task of summarizing the transient dynamics into a few interpretable trends; thus, predicting the overall dynamical system's behaviors is still similar to looking for a needle in a haystack. \n\nThis article addresses the tradeoff between the desire to model transient dynamics and the need to constrain the set of extracted features to a reasonable size. Summarization helps to distill useful information and general trends from the data making them interpretable. Studies that propose summarizing time series are mostly domain‐specific and lack generalization (S. Ahmad, Taskaya‐Temizel, & Ahmad,  ; Kacprzyk, Wilbik, & Zadrożny,  ; Sripada et al.,  ). This article offers a novel probabilistic pattern summarization framework called “statelets,” highlighting the dynamics of capturing FC of the brain. Statelets are driven by the desire to build a general summarization method and rely on an efficient earth mover distance (EMD) (Rüschendorf,  ) implementation supporting kernel density estimation (KDE) in motif space. We demonstrate how the EMD may be an effective similarity metric for motif comparison. EMD provides a scale‐independent comparison between signatures that can handle variable‐length substructures and account for partial matching (Rubner, Tomasi, & Guibas,  ). \n\nResults present the summary prototypes of both connectivity dynamics. The statelets from both groups pose substantial group differences in multiple dynamic properties of the brain's functional system. The connection rank computed based on the probability density (PD) within the groups reveals unique co‐fluctuations among functional brain networks and their corresponding dynamic interplay (Figure 7). Connections identified in SZ patients show reduced modularity relative to healthy controls (HCs) (Figure 9), and in addition, HC statelets are significantly more recurring than in SZ (Figure 10). An experiment of the transitivity of time decay (TD) graphs indicates that HC networks are more often in sync and for more extended periods, consistent with increased inter‐communication to SZ (Figure 11). Finally, statelet‐wise subgrouping of the dynamics reports salient and stable group differences in sensorimotor (SM), cognitive control (CC), and cerebellar (CB) domains, which are not observed in earlier studies. The main contributions of our article can be highlighted as follows:   \n• Propose a new statelet approach to address the limitations of current sliding window plus clustering (SWC) methods for dFNC analysis. \n  \n• Adapt the EMD as a distance metric for comparing time series motifs. \n  \n• Use time‐series motifs for capturing transient recurring co‐fluctuation of neuronal populations and unwarp the FC in a finer time scale. \n  \n• Develop a novel probabilistic motifs summarization framework for providing the synopsis of the dynamic through a subset of connectivity prototypes. \n  \n• Use PD of motifs to assess spatial consistency across a group. \n  \n• Introduce a TD metric to investigate the summary signatures' temporal consistency. \n  \n• Enable measurement of the brain's dynamic properties: an inherent dynamical system. \n  \n• Show significant differences in SZ patients who generally show less frequent and shorter statelets. \n  \n\n\n## DEFINITIONS AND   BACKGROUND  \n  \n### Definition 1: Dynamic functional network connectivity \n  \ndFNC is a time‐varying correlation typically computed using a sliding window (block of time points, for example, 30–60 s) technique among ICs of the brain. The correlation value at each window also quantifies the FC strength between a pair of brain networks within the time frame. \n\n\n### Definition 2:   dFNC   time course \n  \nA dFNC time series,   T   =   w  ,   w  ,   w  , …,   w   is a sequential set of   n   real values, where   w   represents the correlation between a pair of ICs of the brain for a certain period.   w   stands for a sliding window of a certain size. There is one such TC for each pair of components (connections). \n\n\n### Definition 3: Connections/pair \n  \nA connection is a functional association between a pair of independent neural components. We use “connection” and “pair” interchangeably in our writing. \n\n\n### Definition 4: Subsequence \n  \nGiven a time series   T   of length   n  , a subsequence   S   is a subset of length   m   ≤   n   contiguous indices of   T  . \n\n\n### Definitions 5: Motif \n  \nGiven a time series   T   of length n, a motif   H   is a subsequence of   T   with length   m   having the minimum average distance from   C   − 1 other   m  ‐length subsequences of   T  .   H   is the most recurring shape in   T   of length   m  . \n\n\n### Definition 6: Statelets \n  \nGiven a collection (constant/variable‐lengths) of time series motifs   G   and a positive real number   d   (size parameter), Statelets   S   is a subset of size   d   of state‐shape prototypes evaluated using the proposed summarization framework. \n\n\n\n## DATA COLLECTION AND PREPROCESSING \n  \nWe used an existing SZ dataset for generating the dFNC TCs in this project (Keator et al.,  ). The data repository has resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from 163 HCs (117 males, 46 females; mean age 36.9) and 151 age‐ and gender‐matched patients with SZ (114 males, 37 females; mean age 37.8) during the eyes‐closed condition. Collected data pass‐through data quality control (explained in Allen et al.,  ; Damaraju et al.,  ). The participant's consent was obtained before scanning following the Internal Review Boards of affiliated institutions. Data were collected with a repetition time (TR) of 2 s on 3T scanners. Imaging data for six of the seven sites were collected on a 3T Siemens Tim Trio System and a 3rGeneral Electric Discovery MR750 scanner at one site. Resting‐state fMRI scans were acquired using a standard gradient‐echo echo‐planar imaging paradigm: Field of view of 220 × 220 mm (64 × 64 matrices), TR = 2 s, Echo time  = 30 ms, Fractional anisotropy  = 770, 162 volumes, 32 sequential ascending axial slices of 4 mm thickness and 1 mm skip. Subjects had their eyes closed during the resting state scan. \n\nData preprocessing, quality control, and dFNC approximation follow the standard pipeline described in (Rashid et al.,  ). The preprocessing follows a standard pipeline that has been adapted in several previous studies (Agcaoglu et al.,  ; Damaraju et al.,  ; Espinoza et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ,  ). The preprocessing steps include image alignment (motion correction), slice timing correction, spatial normalization, despiking, and smoothing, which are commonly used for fMRI preprocessing. Depending on the MRI scanning protocols and collected data, the preprocessing parameters were selected and described in these studies and their supplementary (Allen et al.,  ,  ; Damaraju et al.,  ). First, rigid body motion correction has been done using the INRIAlign toolbox in SPM to correct for subject head motion, followed by a slice‐timing correction to account for timing differences in slice acquisition (Freire & Mangin,  ). Then, the scans went through a 3dDespike algorithm to regress out the outlier effect and warped to a Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template and resampled to 3 mm  isotropic voxels. Instead of Gaussian smoothing, we smoothed the data to 6 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) using the BlurToFWHM algorithm, which performs smoothing by a conservative finite difference approximation to the diffusion equation. Additionally, the voxel TC was variance normalized before performing the ICA (Hyvärinen & Oja,  ), as this has shown better to decompose subcortical (SB) sources in addition to cortical networks. Group ICA (Calhoun et al.,  ) was performed on the preprocessed data and identified 100 ICNs. Subject‐specific spatial maps (SMs) and TCs were obtained using the spatiotemporal regression back reconstruction approach implemented in GIFT software (Calhoun et al.,  ). To ensure estimation stability, we repeated the ICA algorithm 20 times in ICASSO, and aggregate SMs were estimated as the modes of component clusters. Subject‐specific SMs and TCs were obtained using the spatiotemporal regression back reconstruction (Calhoun et al.,  ; Erhardt et al.,  ) implemented in GIFT. Following ICA, we obtained one sample   t  ‐test map for each SM across all subjects and threshold these maps to obtain regions of peak activation clusters for each component; we also computed the mean power spectra of the corresponding TCs. These heuristics curated a group of components as ICNs if their peak activation clusters fell on gray matter and showed less overlap with known vascular, susceptibility, ventricular, and edge regions corresponding to head motion. We also ensured that the mean power spectra of the selected ICN TCs showed higher low‐frequency spectral power. This selection procedure resulted in 47 ICNs out of the 100 ICs obtained. The cluster stability/quality (  I  ) index for these ICNs over 20 ICASSO runs was very high (  I   > 0.9) for all of the components, except an ICN that resembles a language network (  I   = 0.74). The subject‐specific TCs corresponding to the ICNs selected were detrended, orthogonalized with respect to estimated subject motion parameters, and then despiked. The despiking procedure involved detecting spikes as determined by AFNI's 3dDespike algorithm and replacing spikes by values obtained from the third‐order spline fit to neighboring clean portions of the data. The despiking process reduces the impact/bias of outliers on subsequent FNC measures. The 47 components are organized into modular partitions using the Louvain algorithm of the brain connectivity toolbox. We computed functional network connectivity (FNC), defined as pairwise correlation between ICN TCs. To compute the time varying FNC between the ICN TCs defined as pairwise correlation dFNC between two ICA TCs referred to dFNC was evaluated using a sliding window correlation approach with a window size of 22 TR (44 s) in steps of 1 TR (Allen et al.,  ; Calhoun et al.,  ). The window constituted a rectangular window of 22 time points convolved with Gaussian of sigma 3 TRs to obtain tapering along the edges (Allen et al.,  ). We compute the time‐varying FNC for each connection between a pair of nodes (ICNs) and generate a time series. We estimated covariance from the regularized inverse covariance matrix (Smith et al.,  ; Varoquaux et al.,  ) using the graphical LASSO framework (Friedman, Hastie, & Tibshirani,  ). The regularization parameter was optimized for each subject by evaluating the log‐likelihood of the subject's unseen data in a cross‐validation framework. Consistent for all post‐hoc steps for extracting and validating. Subject‐wise dFNC values were Fisher‐Z transformed and residualized with respect to age, gender, and site. After computing dFNC values for each subject, covariance values were Fisher‐Z transformed and residualized with respect to age, gender, and site using the reduced model determined from our static FNC (sFNC) analysis. The mean dFNC matrix was computed over all subjects. This connectivity represents the association/relation between two parts of the brain and how this relation evolves with time. In other words, we can interpret this connection as an abstraction of communication between different brain hubs to process information. As such, both highly positive and negative correlations are informative to characterize the relations in two distinct directions. The hypothesis is the presence of these connections make the neural system process information and generate response in a healthy manner. Likewise, having disruption in those connections can cause symptoms present in several mental disorder like SZ. Our study aims to extract most dominant repetitive patterns of these connections by decomposing the time series in a granular scale. Then, summarize these patterns as a global representative set (Statelets) that helps leveraging this knowledge to measure different dynamic features of brain in post hoc study. More details about the components and the dFNC computation is available in this study and its supplementary (Damaraju et al.,  ). \n\n\n## EARTH MOVER DISTANCE \n  \nWe implement the EMD for computing distances between motifs. EMD usually measures the dissimilarity between two probability distributions (Levina & Bickel,  ; Vallender,  ). Also, EMD is effectively adaptable for time series subsequence comparison. It corresponds to the minimum amount of work required to make two subsequences look‐alike (Champion, De Pascale, & Juutinen,  ). For   p   and   q  , two given signatures,   F  (  p  ,   q  ) represents the set of all possible flow between   p   and   q  . Then, the work is defined as follows, \n\nhere   is some measure of dissimilarity (e.g., Euclidean distance),   is the optimal flow that minimizes the cost between   and   (  i  th time points). The terms   m   and   n   denote the length of the signatures, respectively. The heuristic minimizes the amount of work done to compute the EMD between   p   and   q   given by the following equation (Andoni, Indyk, & Krauthgamer,  ; Champion et al.,  ). \n\nThe above equations provide the canonical formulation for computing EMD between signatures of any dimensions; however, we opt to compare shapes from one‐dimensional time series. Hence, we propose a more straightforward implementation in the next paragraph where we are not required to use an off‐the‐shelf distance measure. \n\n### Implementation in our study \n  \nWe use a particular case of EMD for a one‐dimensional time series, which parses through the vectors and keeps track of how much flow occurs between consecutive time points. Here, flow is the difference between the amplitudes of two‐time series at a given time point. The method recursively accumulates the absolute work done at each time point, and finally, the summation over the time points corresponds to the EMD distance (see Equations   and  ). Equations   and   normalize shapes   p   and   q  , respectively. \n\n\n\n## OUR PROPOSED FRAMEWORK \n  \nOur architecture performs two fundamental steps to estimate state‐shape prototypes (statelets) from time‐series dataset, (A) motif discovery and (B) summarization. Figure 3 depicts the subprocesses required to perform these steps. \n\n### Step 1: Motif discovery \n  \nEach dFNC time series represents the FC between two distinct brain networks. Therefore, it is not feasible to impose a common motif length for all the time series in the dataset, like most other motif discovery methods. The proposed heuristic takes a range [R1 R2] and suggests the perfect length to explore the time series within that boundary. In our case, dFNC is collected using a window size of 22 time points. So, the lower bound for R1 > 22. The upper bound for R2 should be confined within half of the signal length for a sensible parcellation of dFNC. Since the study aims to observe transient signatures in the data, we select the range [30 50] in our analysis. Figure   demonstrates the step for performing motif discovery. At first, the process creates all the subsequences of different lengths and then passes these candidates through the following subroutines (Matlab scripts). \n  \nOur proposed methodology for time series motifs discovery and summarization. (a) Step 1: Motif extraction using EMD as a similarity metric. The subroutine takes out the most repetitive pattern (possibly with multiple occurrences) of a given time course, (b) Step 2: Summarization of motifs using their probability density computed by a kernel density estimator (KDE). It takes a bag of varying length motifs and generates a concise smaller collection of the most frequent shapes/patterns representing the functional system (SZ/HC). We defined these prototypes as the statelets. The EMD distance matrix is used for both performing the tSNE and computing probability density (PD) of the motifs. The relevant processing blocks and their intuitions in Step 2 are described elaborately in Section  \n  \n####  EMD   layer \n  \nFor a given candidate of length  , the algorithm searches through the timepoints by taking all other candidates of that length and computing the EMD between them. We can consider the selected candidate as a kernel here, and the idea is to apply that kernel on the input signal to compute distances. \n\n\n#### Pooling local minima \n  \nThe module pools a subset of top matches (minimum distance) instead of just one across the signal. Since motifs are repeating signatures, intuitively, we scrutinize the top matches only. It decomposes the input TC into several subsections and pools the minimum from each subsection. \n\n\n#### Mean of   LM  's and global minimum \n  \nThis layer computes the mean of those local minima, representing the overall performance by that specific candidate. After finishing computation for all the candidates of  , the method selects the global minimum, which corresponds to the best acquirable matching (BAM) score. \n\n\n#### The best length selection \n  \nTo extract most recurring transient patterns, a recommender unit optimizes two objectives using the BAM scores considering all different lengths (i) minimizing the motif's length and (ii) maximizing the similarity score. The recommender unit returns the best length for decomposing a time series. \n\n\n#### Motif extraction \n  \nWe have already collected information from the length selection process, that is, distance, occurrences required for motifs extraction. So, using the leading candidate as the benchmark, the subroutine collects similar nonoverlapping occurrences of local motifs across the TC and stores these motifs for creating global dominants across the subjects for a given pair. \n\nThis analysis compares the dFNC time‐series datasets across the two groups, HC and SZ. After discovering the motifs from all the dFNC time series, we have a large population of variable length patterns. Next, a group‐wise summarization is performed on these motifs. \n\n\n\n### Step 2: Summarization \n  \nThe decomposition technique (motif discovery) transforms the FC into a diverse connectivity signatures manifold. Each pair of components (connection) discovers a group of shapes from all the subjects. Summarization aims to fetch the representatives of the motif's collection. The intuition is to find highly persistent patterns from all the distinctive subgroups of the population to ensure that statelets approximately capture all the diversities in the given stack of motifs. The persistence is measured from the shape's PD across the given trajectory, and the subgrouping is unveiled through the t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE). Our summarization scheme weighs the tSNE points using the corresponding PD. Then, an off‐the‐shelf peak technique locates the expected prototypes with standard smoothing and proximity parameters. To run the subprocesses, the probabilistic summarization runs a module called “FindDominants”: a suite of Matlab and Python scripts consisting of four steps (a, b, c, and d) mentioned in Figure   to identify pairwise dominant motifs. We replicate the same analysis for both subject groups SZ and HC. \n\n####  EMD   matrix \n  \nWe need the distance from each motif to all others to measure the density and to subgroup them using tSNE. Here, we use EMD again for computing the distance matrix. First, we normalize the TCs to make our distance invariant to scale and offset. Then, calculate cross EMD across the motifs, which creates a square matrix of   n   ×   n   dimension where   n   is the number of shapes in the given collection. \n\n\n#### Kernel density estimator \n  \nOur method applies KDE to calculate the PD of data instances (motifs) in the population. We incorporate a Gaussian kernel with optimal bandwidth (Sheather & Jones,  ; Silverman,  ) in KDE. In this setting, kernel density at a point   x   is given by Equation  , \n\nFor ‘  D  ’ dimensions, the formulation becomes, where   n   is the number of samples,   is the kernel with a smoothing parameter,   h   is called the bandwidth. The kernel is a non‐negative function and   h   > 0. The common practice uses the Gaussian kernel for a smoother density model, simplifying the following kernel density model. here   is the SD of the Gaussian components. Another crucial part of the process is to select an appropriate bandwidth (  h  ) for the density, and several strategies for selecting   (I. A. Ahmad & Amezziane,  ; Turlach,  ). Our approach incorporates the rule‐of‐thumb bandwidth estimator for Gaussian (Scott,  ). The optimal choice for   is following, here   is the SD of the samples, and   is the number of total samples. The term   in the equation corresponds to the distance between the sample   and  . So, we assign EMD distances between the shapes computed in Section   to assign the value of the term   in the equation. Using Equation ( ), KDE generates PD for all motifs in the collection. \n\n\n####  tSNE   using   EMD  \n  \ntSNE is a powerful and flexible visualization tool for high‐dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two‐ or three‐dimensional map (Gisbrecht, Schulz, & Hammer,  ; Maaten & Hinton,  ). Decentralized stochastic neighbor embedding (dSNE) separates the data subgroups using their distance metrics (Saha et al.,  ,  ). In our case, tSNE considers each motif as a data point and uses the EMD matrix (computed in Section  ) to select the neighbors for the embeddings. Next, the method weighs all the points using their corresponding PD. Figure   presents an example of how tSNE reveals intrinsic subgroups of data collection. The color indicates the PD. The brighter, the higher. The visualizations in the subsequent steps are generated using this same plot. \n  \nAn example of tSNE using EMD distance on a collection of real motifs. Data points represent the motifs weighted by their probability density computed using KDE.   X   and   Y   axis stand for the horizontal and vertical coordinates of each point, respectively \n  \n\n#### Two‐dimensional mapping \n  \nAlthough the above tSNE map unveils the subgroups, we still need to mechanistically locate the summary prototypes. To employ the peak finder, we need to map the tSNE plot (Figure  ) to a standard discrete two‐dimensional (2D) coordinate system, for example, a 2D grid. This subroutine assigns all tSNE points to a two‐dimensional discrete system and accumulates the PD of all closely neighboring shapes onto a single cell. The strive is to make dominant points more distinguishable by increasing the frequency in the corresponding vicinity. This approach discretizes the range of coordinates into a set of integer intervals. As a result, multiple points from the tSNE plot are stacked together into a single cell, as shown in Figure   to summarize the PD of a close neighborhood. \n  \nMapping tSNE points to a 2D matrix for accumulating PD's of close neighbors. Therefore, we observe the higher density data with a brighter color in the figure \n  \n\n#### Gaussian blur and peak finding \n  \nDefocusing noise helps identify significant features/data points representing the subgroup. We apply a Gaussian blur to the tSNE image to facilitate the estimation of the peaks. Figure   displays how the blurring effect changes the focus toward relevant loci of the image. Then, we use a two‐dimensional peak finder to compute the high‐density data points. The peak finder extracts a characteristic shape from each subgroup with a higher PD. The spikes in Figure   indicate the representative motifs (statelets) from the whole population. It visualizes one spike per high‐density subspace. It visualizes how the summarization scheme covers the whole state‐shape trajectory and approximates the synopsis. For more clarity, the method restricts the peak finding subroutine by calibrating the smoothing parameter to avoid creating a pile of similar patterns. The objective is to find a diversified set of shapes that reasonably approximates the overall dynamics. \n  \nAfter applying a Gaussian blur on the 2D image to defocus less dense data points \n    \nA three‐dimensional view of the tSNE plot after marking the peaks extracted by a 2D peak finder. The peak finder selects at least one peak from each high‐density region. Later, we use peak's tSNE coordinates to determine the real motifs it represents \n  \n\n\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \n  \nWe divide the dataset into 163 HC subjects and 151 SZ patients (SZ) groups. Each subject has   C   = 1,081 pairs of components or 1,081 connections: 1081 dFNC TCs. For each connection, we take TCs from all the subjects within that group (HC/SZ). Our method evaluates a subset of statelets from both groups of subjects (SZ/HC). The PD of these high dimensional state shapes denotes the consistency of these statelets across connections among multiple brain regions. In Figure  , we show the most frequent statelets from both groups. We used the Jonker‐Volgenant algorithm (Cao,  ) for a linear assignment problem that optimizes the mapping of tSNE coordinates to a two‐dimensional grid preserving the matching shapes in the same neighborhood constraint. In Figure  , we compute the statelet's PD that denotes the consistency of these statelets across connections among multiple brain regions. Each bar indicates how frequently a connection's statelet has appeared in the group dynamics. The frequencies are also sorted based on their relative rank computed on their frequency in both patient and control groups. This serves to analyze the connection's readiness in the functional dynamics. We can see that the pair (connections) rank is very different in each group, suggesting a diverse influence of a connection driving the dynamics of patients versus controls. The observation indicates two distinct subsets of connection drive the group dynamics and evident a high‐level group difference in terms of neural components participating in the information processing. Further analysis is required to shed more light on these differences. Another observation is frequency of the statelets in HC connections is higher than in the SZ. To test the statistical significance of this difference between the two distributions, we compute a Kendall tau correlation coefficient, which is traditionally used to measure the ordinal association between two entities (Kendall,  ; Puka,  ). The hypothesis test evaluates   = 0.045 with a   p  ‐value = 0.025 indicating a statistically significant difference. \n  \nA subset of dominant motifs from SZ and HC dynamics. The motifs are detrended and visualized using tSNE followed by the Jonker‐Volgenant algorithm for the linear assignment problems. A similar type of shape is embedded into the same neighborhood. We can see a few potential subgroups of motifs. The blank space in the figure was generated because we used a larger 2D grid than the number of motifs to display. So, the algorithm optimizes the location for each motif from the 2D coordinate system to assign the matching patterns in the nearby vicinity. The   X   axis is time, and the   Y   axis represents the dynamic functional connectivity strength \n    \nEach connection's probability density (PD) demonstrates how frequently the statelets extracted from a connection appear in the group dynamic. Each connection has two density values: one per subject group. Blue demonstrates PD in controls (HC) and red in the patients (SZ). We sort the connections low to high according to their PD in the SZ group (left subplot), and HC sorts the right subplot. Y axis represents the order of the links after sorting, and X axis depicts their corresponding PD. We observe that the rank of connections differs in both subject's groups in terms of their PD; the PD difference is statistically significant and visually evident in the plot \n  \n### Dynamic features analysis \n  \nWe focus more on the dynamic features of the neural system, which have been primarily unexplored in previous studies of dFNC. The dynamic properties of these representative shapes show significant group differences between HC and SZ phenotypes. \n\n#### Recurrence \n  \nTo quantify the recurrence of statelets, we use passage coding by convolving the group‐wise most frequent statelet with each connectivity time series. Passage coding annotates a time series with the corresponding convolution score and visually perceivable the repetitions. Figure   presents the occurrences of the group statelets in individual dynamics (randomly selected three subjects from each group). We investigated the recurrence of statelets for all the subjects and got consistent results, as shown in Figure  . Statelets are designed to be the most generalized envelopes of brain connectivity time series; thus, higher recurrence endorses better convergence to the standard form of connectivity. The agreement toward regular co‐fluctuations by the connection aids synchronization in the brain circuitry. In the SZ dynamic, the repetitions of statelets are significantly lower than HC. That leads to a weaker association between the brain components in SZ dynamics to perform smoother cognition. Also, fewer connections are present in the SZ dynamics than HC, which indicates the absence of necessary communication among the subunits of the brain to process brain signals. Overall, the recurrence helps understand the pattern of communication (e.g., message passing) between the modules of the brain. Apparently, a more connected brain graph with the edges characterized by a recurrent communication scheme is required to produce the necessary cognitive response. This recurrence analysis indicates the absence of the necessary repetition of communications between the submodules of the brain in the SZ dynamic. This provides a ground for further study to explore the reasoning behind these abrupt connectivity patterns. Also, more analyses are required to identify why these disruptions are being triggered. \n  \nEach graph represents the occurrences of the most recurring statelets over each subject's time course. These are three randomly selected subjects from the HC (top) and SZ (bottom) groups. We convolve the group statelets with the subject dynamics (all the dFNC time courses, 1,081) to investigate the recurrence of the statelets over time. Then, we sorted the pairs based on the dominant shape's first occurrence in their time series. Consequently, the early the statelets appear in a pair's time course, the higher the pair/connection in that subject's dynamics—we threshold these convolutions matching scores at 0.8 for both groups to track down the strong appearances only. The color intensity corresponds to how strongly/weakly the shape appears in that part of the course. The color bar is identical for all the reference subjects in the figure \n  \n\n#### Modularity \n  \nThe line graphs in Figure 11 illustrate the ensemble behavior of the connections in both dynamics (SZ/HC). The value represents the number of connections with similar prototypes at each time point. Throughout the scan session, comparatively more HC connections are activated in identical time steps than patients. This characterizes the higher modularity in the HC functional network/graph (the connections between the functional components of the brain). Modularity is imperative because it quantifies the strength of the network's division into modules. Each module consists of a subset of nodes, independent brain components in our case. These modules help data transmission by performing specific tasks independently. Results show individuals with higher baseline modularity exhibit more significant improvement with cognitive training, suggesting that a more modular baseline network state may contribute to greater adaptation in response to cognitive training (Arnemann et al.,  ). Also, cognitive ability is influenced by the relative extent of integration and segregation of functional networks (i.e., modules) distributed across distant brain regions (Chen, Abrams, & D'Esposito,  ; Stevens et al.,  ). Subsequently, the difference in modularity is informative about the cognitive symptoms of SZ. In addition, the graph shows SZ connections become modularized at the end of the time series, whereas the HC ensembles are reduced by their size (Figure  ). This ensemble activation also demonstrates a distinct synchronization pattern between SZ and HC brains and suggests an interchanging control by various neural components. \n  \nBased on probability density ranking (in Figure  ), we computed a collective appearance of the connections across all the subjects. The X axis shows the time steps, and the Y axis corresponds to the number of pairs connections that show the first statelet at that step, which indicates the activation of the pair \n  \n\n#### Consistency graphs \n  \nTo measure the statelets' temporal consistency in the connectivity time series, we introduced a metric called TD. The primary motivation behind introducing TD is to approximate the temporal consistency of the statelets. Also, measuring how frequently these generalized dominant patterns appear in the timeline. The metric indicates how temporally localized or widespread the statelets are. TD is defined as follows. \n\nTD: a temporal consistency measure—The TD approximates how consistently a pair's connectivity exhibits the dominant motif in the TC. The metric captures the temporal information of the summary shapes and integrates it across a group dynamic. The following equation describes TD. \n\nHere, |  S  | = The total number of subjects in the group SZ/HC and   T   the index at which the pair has appeared for the first time in a subject (  T   = 1 to 136). If the pair is not present in a subject's dynamic, then   T   =   thus, TD for that pair in a subject is zero. We calculate the TD for each connection in a subject's dynamic and lately compute the average across the subjects within a group (SZ/HC). We used the meantime decay computed on the group dynamic for the group representation. We consider the appearance of a connection in a subject's dynamic based on the first occurrence of group statelet on that time series. The occurrence is calculated based on a thresholded convolution score. We also sorted the connection based on their first initialization in the subject's dFNC. The intuition was to investigate which connections are responsible for triggering the convergence toward statelets and how it propagates the dominance across the TC. The expected time point at which the connection is initiated in the dynamic is inverted. So, if the TD is very localized, then the mean is very close to that time point and has a higher value. In essence, it quantifies the temporal uniformity of the statelets in a subject's dynamic. Since statelets are the most repeated, stable, and representative subsequences of the time series, this attribute can potentially explain the connection's affinity toward a more generic connectivity state contributing to the dynamics. Also, TD estimates how quickly/lately the connectivity rectifies their initial disparity and converges to routine cognition. It characterizes a connection as consistently late (low TD value), consistently early (high TD value), pseudo‐random positioning (medium TD value, e.g., 0.10 to 0.15), consistent but sparse in the group dynamics (0.5–0.9), etc. \n\nFigure   demonstrates the average TD graphs computed on both dynamics. Here, the vertices are independent brain networks, and the edge represents the connection between two functional networks. The weight of the edge stands for the TD; the darker, the higher. As we can see, HC functional networks are firmly connected, and most of the connections (out of 1,081) pass the TD benchmark. On the other hand, only a small subset of SZ connections converges to their group statelets. This provides evidence that the consistency of SZ network connections is considerably lower than HC. The functional connections between different brain components show more substantial temporal consistency in HC. SZ statelets are more dispersed along the timeline, consequently lacking the expected connectivity signature in the active channels. It might impact overall information processing due to a deficiency in temporally sensitive message passing in the functional network. To further probe the interconnections, we computed the transitivity of each subject's TD graph. Figure   shows the histograms of transitivity of subject‐wise TD graphs in both groups. Transitivity symbolizes the global probability of the network (connectivity graph) to have adjacent nodes interconnected, revealing the existence of tightly connected communities, e.g., clusters and subgroups. Most of the SZ graphs have zero or very low transitivity compared to HCs. We compute a two‐sample   t   test on the transitivity scores from both groups, and the   p  ‐value,   p   = 9.23e‐88, indicates the difference is highly statistically significant. Higher transitivity suggests that modules in the network consistent with prior work showing increased modularity are linked to improved cognitive performance (Arnemann et al.,  ). The analysis indicates that HC networks intercommunicate more consistently and keep the channels up than SZ. This result is consistent with previous work (Allen et al.,  ; Karlsgodt, Sun, & Cannon,  ; Rashid et al.,  ), which suggested that patients exhibit more erratic and less efficient communication among brain regions than controls. Figure   shows the average TD of each connection in both SZ and HC groups. The rightmost map shows HC‐SZ group differences. All the pairs in HC show a more substantial TD than SZ, especially in visual, SM, and default mode (DM) regions. Notably, HC subjects show higher TD than patients with SZ, and the apparent group differences present almost all over the brain. That also makes the data more useful for classification. Intuitively, we feed subject‐wise TD data to multiple classifiers and get good accuracy in every case. To avoid bias, the statelets are extracted from the whole dataset without using group (SZ/HC) information (unsupervised). Thus, the classification accuracies are reasonably comparable. For clarity, we can consider it a dimensionality reduction method like principal component analysis (PCA) (Wold, Esbensen, & Geladi,  ) for better features selection. We compare the performance between running the models directly on the dFNC matrix and methods like PCA (Wold et al.,  ) for better features selection. We compare the performance between running the models directly on the dFNC matrix and the subject‐wise TD. We use multiple classifiers to test TD and observe significant accuracy improvement for more robustness. Figure   shows how the models perform in both cases. We can see a simple SVM or logistic regression model using TD outperforms all other methods, including LSTM with attention. \n  \nTime decay graphs from both groups. The nodes are functional networks, edges correspond to the connection between them (maximum 1,081 possible), and the weight represents the mean time decay (TD) of a connection within a group dynamic. We compute color scaling from the 95 percentiles of the total values. After thresholding at average group mean (SZ group mean + HC group mean)/2, 1,061 edges survive in the HC group and only 16 edges in the SZ group \n    \nHistogram of transitivity from subject‐wise time decay graphs. It refers to the extent to which the relation between two nodes in a network connected by an edge is transitive. A significant portion of SZ subjects shows 0 transitivity, which means the connections are less consistent across different subjects. We show the differences are statistically significant using a two‐sample   t  ‐test on both distributions. Transitivity is also related to the clustering coefficient \n    \nPairwise mean time decays in healthy control (HC) and schizophrenia (SZ) groups. We run a two sample   t   test on the pairwise time decay values to check the statistical significance of their HC‐SZ group differences. The rightmost subfigure represents the FDR corrected   t   values \n    \nClassification accuracy for different methods. First, three methods were applied to the dFNC matrix and LSTM with the attention model applied to the dFNC time course. The last two methods use time decay (TD) for classification. We run the models on time decay information of all the subjects for 100 repeated iterations, and the accuracies are mean across the iterations. We train the model on 200 random samples in each iteration and cross‐validate them using the remaining 114 subjects \n  \ndFNC states from statelets—In this cross‐group analysis, we focus on obtaining statelets across the dataset without separating SZ and HC subjects into two different bins. The major objectives can be articulated (i) extracting cross‐group patterns, (ii) subgrouping the subjects based on statelets, (iii) experimenting with the statelet's connectivity strength and evaluating domain‐wise group differences. It is identical to the group‐wise analysis motif extraction followed by probabilistic summarization. The key difference is we send all the time series (from both subject's group HC/SZ) together through our statelet framework. Then, using approximated statelets as the representative, we partition the collection of shapes into several subgroups (connectivity states). After that, we use the EMD of extracted motifs to determine their association toward a specific subgroup/state—assign motifs to the nearest (lowest EMD) state. Statelets characterize the intrinsic cluster in the motifs extracted from dFNC TCs. The centroids of these clusters are referred to as brain states. We represent these connectivity patterns extracted from the dFNC TC as dFNC states. The centroids of these states represent patterns of FNC (temporal coherence) that individuals move between throughout the course of the experiment. We evaluate the HC‐SZ group differences in connectivity strength across the subjects within a state. For measuring the statistical significance of these differences, we use a two‐sample   t   test. The   t  ‐values provide significant group differences in connectivity strength throughout the distinct regions of the brain (Figure  ). HC subjects in state 1 show stronger connections than SZ, and differences are statistically significant in SM, CC, and DM regions. In states 2 and 3, the differences are mostly HC < SZ; in state 3, group differences are statistically significant across the brain but similar strength in the connections between SB and other domains. State 4 shows mostly weaker differences except for a few auditory (AUD) and SB components, demonstrating SZ subjects are more strongly connected than HC in those regions. Two connections between AUD and DM show a statistically significant difference in state 5, and state 6 exhibits HC > SZ in the CC region. Above all, states 7, 8, and 9 show significant connectivity differences in CC and DM regions. Specifically, state 7 depicts HC > SZ and 8 and 9 shows HC < SZ group distinction. In an earlier study (Rashid et al.,  ), strong group differences are mostly in visual and AUD, but we got differences in SM, CC, and CB. We got both HC < SZ and SZ < HC in SM, CC, and DM. We observe the most significant pattern of group differences here in CC, DM, and CB regions. This triangle shows the variation in connectivity between patients and controls across multiple states with an alternating directionality, which indicates a potential biomarker for specific subtypes of SZ. \n  \nHC—SZ group differences in terms of max connectivity strength. State‐wise group differences in functional connectivity (FC). We have both SZ and HC subjects' groups at each state. For each pair of components, we have a subset of statelets from HC subjects and a subset from SZ subjects. Then, we compute the maximum connectivity strength of those statelets from both subgroups. A two‐sample   t   test using a null hypothesis of “No group difference” compares patients' max connectivity versus controls. A higher   t   value indicates the rejection of the null hypothesis irrespective of their sign. However, the sign of   t   values represents the directionality of the group difference. The pair matrix (47 × 47) is labeled into seven different domains subcortical (SB), auditory (AUD), visual (VIS), sensorimotor (SM), cognitive control (CC), defaultmode (DM), cerebellar (CB), respectively. White cells in the matrix indicate either the absence of that pair or nonsignificant group differences for this pair within a state. The upper triangle represents the FDR corrected differences \n  \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nWe proposed a novel method for analyzing dynamic FC via extracting high‐frequency texture from the connectivity space. To our best knowledge, it is the first pattern mining application on dFNC data. The proposed framework addresses issues in current dFNC analysis methods by modeling the dynamics through brief connectivity shapes. The analysis of those motifs enables measuring the characteristics of brain circuitry and network organization. The major contributions of our study are two‐folded, an unsupervised method for motifs discovery using EMD as a distance metric and a probabilistic summarization of these patterns. Because of the complexity of the data, it was necessary to summarize the information into a predictable and concise subspace. To do this, we included a representative snippet of the human brain connectivity graph, using the set of components as reduced space to show how it behaves over time. The experiments facilitate the observation of distinguishing connectivity signatures and the interplay among the hubs to process information. Statelets provide this summary that includes abstraction, analytics, and current trends at a glance. The statelet approach seeks an improved understanding of connectivity states and the mechanism through which their dynamics vary across individuals. Results demonstrate how these state movies help to investigate the dynamic properties of an inherently dynamic system (i.e., brain). Our approach is more robust to noise while observing short‐length dynamic features of the functional dynamics of the brain. These connectivity shapes from SZ and HC dynamics help create a global contrast between healthy and diseased brains and illustrate crucial group differences in several dynamic properties such as recurrence, modularity, and synchronizability. Our method has some limitations and potential future improvements too. That includes high time complexity and parameters tuning. We are working on a dynamic programming implementation of motif extractions to reduce the time complexity to a polynomial order—also, a framework for automatic fine‐tuning of the model's free parameters. However, statelets provide shape‐based analytics and outlines of the dynamics for the first time. It enriches our understanding of how networks communicate in spontaneous brain activity and the pattern of binding/impairment between them to maximize information transfer and minimize connection costs. We believe this would fill in a gap in the field that will help us understand the dynamics better, possibly providing an improved way to study neuropsychiatric disorders more effectively. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTERESTS \n  \nThere is no conflict of interest. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nVince D.

However, the manner by which such fluctuations track aspects of human behavior remains unresolved. The current report takes a data-driven approach to characterize how time-varying patterns of human brain functional connectivity differ from traditional static measures in their ability to track aspects of personality and cognitive ability. We determine that time-varying patterns of functional connectivity not only track similar aspects of behavior as do static measures, but also unique behavioral qualities as well, specifically those that reflect behavioral variability. These results highlight the importance and relevance of examining time-varying measures of functional connectivity. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nMeasuring activity in the human brain during a task-free “resting state” has become common as this activity is known to be spatially and temporally organized (Biswal et al.,  ). These patterns of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) are sensitive to numerous aspects of behavior, including cognitive performance (Stevens et al.,  ; Chan et al.,  ), age (Chan et al.,  ), and the extent of cognitive impairments (Alexander-Bloch et al.,  ; Rudie et al.,  ). Using rsFC data from the Human Connectome Project (Van Essen et al.,  ), a recent report utilized   (CCA) to reveal that rsFC and numerous behavioral measures were linked via a single mode of population covariation, providing a single inextricable link between stable functional brain organization and interindividual behavioral differences (Smith et al.,  ). \n\nThe majority of neuroimaging studies have investigated rsFC by assuming that it is stable across the measurement period. However, a recent emphasis has been placed on determining whether, and to what degree, rsFC systematically varies in time (Calhoun et al.,  ). While some measurable fluctuations are likely due to noise or nonneural physiological signals (Hutchison et al.,  ; Lindquist et al.,  ; Hindriks et al.,  ; Duff et al.,  ; Lurie et al.,  ), there is evidence that these rapidly evolving changes have a neuronal basis (Chang & Glover,  ; de Pasquale et al.,  ; Brookes et al.,  ; Thompson,  ). Moreover, analysis of time-varying FC might reveal new relationships to behavior unobtainable by static analyses (Cohen,  ; Kucyi et al.,  ). There is recent evidence that fluctuations of task-based FC track aspects of   (Khambhati et al.,  ) and attention (Sadaghiani et al.,  ), suggesting that flexible network reconfiguration indexes trial-by-trial performance. \n\nIt is important to consider ways in which static and time-varying FC differ, and how these differences impact the way each modality encodes aspects of behavior. Whereas static measures provide a snapshot of the stable organization of the brain, time-varying measures index higher order relationships between brain regions. Such measures include the degree to which functional networks vary their interconnectivity with other networks, the change in global organizational structure, and how the global FC profile transitions between different functional substates (Vidaurre et al.,  ; Shine & Breakspear,  ). Thus, it is likely that measures of static and time-varying FC encode different behavioral features; however, a precise characterization of this relationship is missing. Studies have focused on either one type of connectivity (static: Smith et al.,  ; time-varying: Casorso et al.,  ), or on specific behaviors (Rosenberg et al.,  ), but only two studies attempted to simultaneously disentangle static and time-varying FC’s behavioral relevance (Jia et al.,  ; Liégeois et al.,  ). Jia and colleagues ( ) found that time-varying measures of FC explained more variance in behaviors tracking alertness, cognition, emotion, and personality than did static FC. Liégeois and colleagues ( ) found that measures of time-varying FC tracked both task-based behavior and self-reported personality traits, whereas static measures only captured self-reported traits. Although leveraging the power of the Human Connectome Project, these studies only had access to basic measures of human behavior, lacking access to measures typically employed by cognitive neuroscientists studying  , cognitive control, and  . \n\nTo directly address the behavioral differences captured by static and time-varying FC, we utilized resting-state blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) data collected alongside a battery of complex behavior and personality measures. These measures ranged across working memory, executive functioning, processing speed, affect, and impulsivity. Building off Smith and colleagues ( ), we leveraged CCA to determine whether there exist modes of covariation between behavior and static, as compared to time-varying, rsFC. Static rsFC was estimated by computing a node-node correlation matrix across all regions of the brain. Time-varying rsFC was estimated by fitting a   (HMM) to the data. The HMM allowed for the characterization of, and transition likelihood between, multiple latent “states” in a data-driven fashion as fast as the modality allowed, overcoming limitations imposed by sliding window methods (Hutchison et al.,  ). The HMM has been used to characterize brain dynamics across multiple neuroimaging modalities during rest (Baker et al.,  ; Vidaurre et al.,  ) and task (Vidaurre et al.,  ). \n\nUsing static FC, CCA revealed a single relationship primarily defined by variance in measures of personality and affect, as well as task-general behavioral features. With time-varying FC, CCA instead revealed two (orthogonal) relationships. The first was highly similar to that found using static FC. However, the second was specific to time-varying FC and was defined by variance in trialwise measures of reaction time to processing speed and working memory tasks, as well as measures tapping into overall processing accuracy. These results suggest that there exists meaningful information in the temporal fluctuations of rsFC patterns that can explain aspects of human behavior to which previous analytic methods have been insensitive. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-three healthy, young adult participants (mean age = 28.26 years, SD = 4.52 years, 10 females) were recruited for a repeated measures study to participate in two or three sessions. Five participants were unable to attend the third study session as a result of having moved away from the state of California. As a result, only 18 participants were included in the third session (mean age = 27.67 years, SD = 4.64 years, 8 females). All participants were native English speakers, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and had normal hearing. Participants were excluded for any history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, use of psychotropic drugs, a history of substance abuse, or MRI contraindications. All participants provided written, informed consent according to the procedures of the University of California Berkeley Institutional Review Board. \n\n\n### Experimental Design and Procedure \n  \nParticipants underwent one practice session approximately 1 week (mean = 6 days, SD = 2.37 days) before their first testing session. They then completed two or three identical testing sessions. Testing sessions 1 and 2 were separated by approximately 1 week (mean = 8 days, SD = 1.47 days), while testing sessions 2 and 3 were separated by approximately 1 year (mean = 399 days, SD = 28.73 days). \n\nEach session began with two 6-minute resting-state scans in the MRI machine, in which participants were instructed to stay awake with their eyes open and fixate on a crosshair. During the first session, the resting-state scans were followed by a structural scan. Immediately after the MRI scan, participants completed two self-report questionnaires and a task outside of the scanner: a visual analog scale (VAS; McCormack et al.,  ), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS; Patton et al.,  ), and a box completion task (Salthouse,  ). Immediately following completion of the questionnaires and task, participants then completed four computerized cognitive tasks in counterbalanced order (different orders across participants and for each session): a Stroop task (Stroop,  ), a digit symbol substitution task (DSST; Rypma et al.,  ), a spatial working memory (WM) task (Kuo et al.,  ), and a Color WM task (Zhang & Luck,  ). Visual depiction of the four computerized task paradigms are shown in  . \n\nThe BIS is a survey that determines measures of impulsivity along a set of three subtraits: “Attentional,” “Motor,” and “Non-planning.” The VAS has participants make a mark along a line segment in which one side represents “Not” and the other side “Extremely” for the following items: “Anxious,” “Happy,” “Sad,” “Nauseous,” “Drowsy,” “Jittery,” “Fatigued,” and “Dizzy.” Participant responses are measured as the distance (in centimeters) away from the “Not” end of the line. The box completion task requires that participants use a pencil to fill in the fourth side of an open-ended square as rapidly as possible. The measure of interest is the duration of time it takes to complete 100 squares. \n\nIn the Stroop task, color words (blue, red, green, yellow) or animal names (horse, bird, cat, dog) printed in different colors (blue, red, green, yellow) were presented on the left side of the computer screen. Participants had to indicate the font color by pressing one of four buttons. For ease of task performance color-to-button mappings were presented at the bottom part of the screen throughout the duration of the experiment. Participants used the four fingers of their right hand for responding with color-to-button mappings randomly assigned to participants. Compatible, neutral, and incompatible trials were presented with equal probability. In compatible trials, color and word were the same. In neutral trials, the task-irrelevant dimension (e.g., word meaning) was not related to the task (e.g., animal names). In incompatible trials, color and word differed. Each Stroop session was 10 minutes long and comprised eight blocks of 36 trials each. The stimuli were presented for 300 ms with an interstimulus interval of 1,700 ms. The measures of interest included the difference score, in milliseconds, between the median response time of correct responses to trials in which there was an incongruity between the word and color (incongruent trials: i.e., the word “RED” in blue text) and the median response time of correct responses to a trial in which the color of the text matched the word (congruent trials: i.e., the word “RED” in red text). Moreover, we also focused on the standard deviation of this response time difference, as well as the accuracy on incongruent trials. We chose not to compute a difference score for accuracy as individual differences for accuracy on congruent trials was likely to be minimal. \n\nThe DSST required that participants indicated via button press whether a presented symbol-number pair correctly matched an on-screen answer key. Nine symbols were paired with numbers 1 through 9, and the answer key was shown at the top of the screen on every trial; 140 pairs were presented in which the symbol-number pair either matched (50%), or did not match (50%), the provided answer key. Pairs were presented on screen for 4,000 ms, during which the participant could indicate their response. Participants were instructed to respond as rapidly and as accurately as possible. Measures of interest included the overall accuracy, median reaction time, and standard deviation of reaction time, for match and nonmatch trials separately. \n\nThe Spatial WM task (“Spatial WM”) required that participants initially encode and retain the color of a rapidly presented set of colored squares. The task followed a 2 (load: 2 vs. 4) × 2 (cue onset: early vs. late) design. Participants viewed an array of 2 or 4 colored squares for 180 ms prior to retaining this information over a 900-ms delay period. In the early-cue condition, a cue appeared in the location of where one of the squares had previously been after 200 ms (and stayed on screen for the remaining 700 ms). In the late-cue condition, the cue appeared after 800 ms (and stayed on screen for the remaining 100 ms). Next, participants had to indicate whether a newly presented colored square, among an array of 2 or 4 colored squares, matched the color of the spatially cued square prior to the delay. The new array remained on screen for 1,920 ms. Participants were instructed to respond as accurately and as quickly as possible. In total, participants completed 240 trials, with 60 trials coming from each condition. Measures of interest included percent accuracy, median reaction time, and the standard deviation of reaction time, across both cognitive loads, for match and nonmatch trials separately. \n\nThe color working memory task (“Color WM”) required that participants initially encode the colors of three squares rapidly presented on screen for 1,000 ms. Following a delay of 500 ms, a visual cue to the location of one of the squares appeared for 500 ms. After a 1,250 ms delay, a distractor color appeared on screen for 500 ms. Following another delay of 1,250 ms, the participants were then presented with a colorwheel for 3,000 ms and were instructed to move the cursor along the wheel in a continuous fashion until the selected color matched the color of the cued square being held in memory. Participants completed 40 trials in total and were provided a 5-second break after the end of the 20th trial. Measures of interest included the median and standard deviation of reaction time and error angle (calculated as the difference in degrees along the colorwheel between the correct answer and the response provided by the participant) across all responses. \n\nDuring the practice session, participants completed the four cognitive tasks so as to familiarize themselves with the tasks before the testing sessions. The purpose of this session was to minimize practice effects. The testing sessions were all identical. The final testing session was conducted on the same MRI machine as the previous sessions, but in a different location. Reliability tests ensured that MRI effects (such as signal-to-noise ratio and artifacts) were not different across the two locations. \n\nBehavioral measures for each subject at each session were considered as separate yet dependent datapoints, and therefore no averaging across sessions occurred. Given the dependent nature of these data points, we utilize the analytic methodology from (Smith et al.,  ), which accounted for familial relationships between specific subjects in the Human Connectome Project. Specifically, we performed all statistics such that permuted null distributions never shuffled labels across sessions for subjects. In other words, all sessions from any particular subject were always grouped together so as to appropriately account for within-subject variability. \n\n\n### Factor Analysis of the Behavioral Data \n  \nAll 31 behavioral measures were included in the analyses and subjected to a factor analysis. Six measures each came from the Spatial WM task and the DSST: percent accuracy, median reaction time, and the standard deviation of reaction times for match and nonmatch trials. Three measures came from the Stroop task: percent accuracy on incongruent trials, median reaction time difference between congruent and incongruent trials, and the standard deviation of the reaction time difference between congruent and incongruent trials. Four measures came from the Color WM task: median and standard deviation of response error, as well as median and standard deviation of reaction times. All eight measures from the VAS were included, as well as the scores of the three subtraits of the BIS. Last, the time to complete all 100 squares for the box completion task was included. \n\nWe clustered the behavioral data into eight factors using MATLAB’s factoran function and allowed for promax oblique rotation ( ). We labeled these factors qualitatively by observing which behavioral measures loaded highest on each factor. We chose eight factors as it most cleanly separated tasks from one another and grouped together correlated measures. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Acquisition \n  \nImaging data were collected on a 3-Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM Trio whole-body MR scanner using a 12-channel head coil at the University of California, Berkeley, Henry H. Wheeler Jr. Brain Imaging Center. Whole-brain functional data were acquired in two runs using a T2*-weighted echo planar imaging pulse sequence (180 volumes/run, 37 interleaved axial slices parallel to the AC-PC line, slice thickness 3.5 mm, interslice distance = 0.7 mm, TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 24 ms, FA = 60°, matrix 64 × 64, field of view 224 mm). A high-resolution T1-weighted structural 3D MP-RAGE was also acquired (160 slices, slice thickness 1 mm, TR = 2,300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, FA = 9°, matrix 256 × 256, field of view 256 mm). An LCD projector back projected a fixation cross for the resting-state scan onto a screen mounted to the radiofrequency (RF) coil. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Processing \n  \nPreprocessing of the imaging data were performed using fMRIPrep 1.1.4 (Esteban, Markiewicz, et al.,  ; Esteban, Blair, et al.,  ), which is based on Nipype 1.1.1 (Gorgolewski et al.,  ). The T1-weighted (T1w) image was corrected for intensity nonuniformity (INU) using N4BiasFieldCorrection (ANTs 2.2.0; Tustison et al.,  , and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow. The T1w-reference was then skull stripped using ANTs BrainExtraction (ANTs 2.2.0), using OASIS as target template. Brain surfaces were reconstructed using recon-all (FreeSurfer 6.0.1; Dale, Fischl, & Sereno,  ), and the brain mask estimated previously was refined with a custom variation of the method to reconcile ANTs-derived and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical gray matter of Mindboggle (Klein et al.,  ). Spatial normalization to the ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c (MNI152NLin 2009cAsym; Fonov et al.,  ) was performed through nonlinear registration with ANTs Registration (ANTs 2.2.0; Avants et al.,  ), using brain-extracted versions of both T1w volume and template. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter, and gray matter was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using fast (FSL 5.0.9; Zhang, Brady, & Smith,  ). \n\nFor each of the BOLD runs found per participant (across all sessions), the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) were estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9; Jenkinson et al.,  ). BOLD runs were slice-time corrected using 3dTshift from AFNI. The BOLD time series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head motion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time series will be referred to as preprocessed BOLD in original space, or just preprocessed BOLD. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer), which implements boundary-based registration (Greve & Fischl,  ). Co-registration was configured with nine degrees of freedom to account for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference. The BOLD time series were resampled to MNI152NLin2009cAsym standard space, generating a preprocessed BOLD run in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space. Several confounding time series were calculated based on the preprocessed BOLD: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS, and three region-wise global signals. FD and DVARS were calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in Nipype (following the definitions by Power et al.,  ). The three global signals were extracted within the CSF, the white matter, and the whole-brain masks (i.e., global signal). The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file. All resamplings were performed with a single interpolation step by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e., head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and template spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using ANTs ApplyTransforms, configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels (Lanczos,  ). \n\nFurther postprocessing included removal of artifactual signals from the time series data. We used recommended nuisance regression approaches based on recent processing comparisons (Ciric et al.,  ; Parkes et al.,  ). We regressed out the six head-motion estimates, the mean white matter signal, the mean cerebral spinal fluid signal, their temporal derivatives and quadratic expansions, and the quadratic expansions of the temporal derivatives. We chose to avoid global signal regression due to (1) the known effect of introducing artifactual negative correlations into the data and (2) the increase in distance-dependent motion effects. As temporal contiguity is necessary to accurately estimate changes in FC across time, we did not apply any scrubbing techniques to our data. Last, we applied a bandpass filter from 0.01 to 0.1 Hz to the data. Mean framewise displacement of our sample was relatively low (mean FD = 0.14, range = 0.06–0.37) and aligned with previously analyzed samples (Power et al.,  ). \n\n\n### \n  \nTo obtain measures of FC, we first measured the mean BOLD signal across all voxels contained within each node of our brain atlases. Cortical nodes were taken from the 400-node Local-Global atlas (Schaeffer et al.,  ). Twenty-one subcortical nodes were taken from the Harvard-Oxford atlas (Makris et al.,  ). Twenty-two cerebellar nodes were taken from the AAL atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al.,  ). Four cortical nodes in bilateral anterior temporal pole regions had to be removed from all analyses due to insufficient coverage (less than 25% of voxels contained data) in one or more participants in one or more scans. This left data from 439 nodes distributed across the entire brain. \n\nScans were concatenated within session, per participant, in order to increase reliability of the measured FC profile for each session. To remove spurious data differences between sessions, each session’s data was standardized. FC was measured as the Pearson correlation coefficient between every node and all other nodes for which there was sufficient coverage. \n\n\n### Hidden Markov Model \n  \n\n### Setup \n  \nThe HMM derives brain dynamics based on BOLD time series parcellation data. The HMM assumes that the time series data are characterized by a number of states that the brain cycles through at different times throughout the scanning period (Baker et al.,  ). \n\nAt each time point   t   of brain activity, the observed time series data was modeled as a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions. Each one of these Gaussian distributions corresponded to a different state k and was described by first-order and second-order statistics (activity [  μ  ] and FC [Σ ], respectively) that can be interpreted as the activity and FC of each state. Using notation, if   x   describes the BOLD data at each time point   t  , then the probability of being in state   k   is assumed to follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution: \n\nIn turn, we modeled how transitions between states took place. The basic Markovian principle that describes the transition between states assumes that the probability of the data being in state   k   at time   t   relates only to the probability of being in state   l   at time   t   −   1  . This can be described by the following equation: where Θ  is the transition probability from state   l   to state   k  . Taken together, the HMM infers the   P  (  s   =   k  ) probabilities for each state k and time t (state time courses) as well as the transition probabilities Θ  and the statistics of each state (  μ  , Σ ) that best describe the data. To make inference tractable, a variational Bayes algorithm was used that works by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the real and the modeled data (Wainwright & Jordan,  ). \n\nThe input time series data for the HMM was the total time series data for all participants and all sessions (for the last session there were only 18 participants). Specifically, across the three sessions and for all participants we concatenated the processed functional time series and obtained a matrix of dimensions: (360 × 23 + 360 × 23 + 360 × 18) × number of regions of interest (439) (Vidaurre et al.,  ). Data were standardized for each participant prior to running the HMM. To control the dimensionality in the final data matrix, a principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction technique was applied on the concatenated time courses using 25 components (Stevner et al.,  ). Finally, the number of states for the HMM was chosen as 12. Both of these settings were similar to the previous work that introduced the use of the HMM on fMRI data (Vidaurre et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Inference \n  \nRunning the HMM with these parameters resulted in a data matrix of dimensions (no. time points × no. participants) × no. states. Each row represented the probability of each state being active at each timepoint for each participant. Additional quantities related to the temporal characteristics of each state could then be obtained. First, we quantified the proportion of time that an individual resided in the state during the scan acquisition (fractional occupancy, FO). Additionally, the switching rate was defined as the difference between the probability of activating a state at time   t   and activating a state at time   t   + 1 summed over all states and over all time points and divided by the number of time points. The HMM also provided each state’s mean activity and connectivity   μ   and Σ , respectively. Finally, the HMM also provided the state transition probability matrix of dimensions (no. states × no. states) where each matrix entry (  k  ,   l  ) quantified the transition probability of going from state   k   to state   l  . \n\nAn agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm was applied to the transition probability matrix in order to determine whether there existed a temporal structure in the data, as had previously been shown with resting-state FC data from the Human Connectome Project (Vidaurre et al.,  ). This analysis starts by classifying each data point as a separate cluster and progressively combines clusters of data at different hierarchical levels: similar data are clustered at a low level of hierarchy and less similar data are clustered at a higher level of hierarchy (Hastie, Friedman, & Tibshirani,  ). We used the   linkage   function as implemented in MATLAB with default settings (method = ‘single,’ distance = ‘euclidean’). We regarded each identified cluster as one metastate. In turn, the metastate time courses were considered as the sum of the time courses of the individual states that comprised them. Fractional occupancy and switching rate of the metastates were calculated as in the case for single states. \n\nTo assess whether there existed any relationship between the derived HMM time-varying FC measures and in-scanner head motion, we first computed the mean FD across both runs for each subject in each session. There existed no difference in mean FD across sessions (all   t  ’s < 1.19, adjusted   p  ’s = 0.679). Next, we correlated these session-specific mean FD values with each of the 17 measures derived from the HMM (i.e., fractional occupancy of each of the 12 states, fractional occupancy of each of the 3 metastates, mean switching rate across the 12 states, and mean switching rate across the 3 metastates). Given the number of statistical tests performed (17 × 3 = 51) and the related nature of the data being assessed, we applied false discovery rate (FDR) correction to our results to account for multiple comparisons. Two of the 51 tests survived multiple comparisons correction: Fractional Occupancy of State 1 in Session 2 (  r   = 0.847, adjusted   p   < 0.001), and Fractional Occupancy of State 11 in Session 3 (  r   = 0.734, adjusted   p   = 0.026). Given the lack of any consistent relationship between in-scanner head motion and our HMM measures across sessions, it is likely that our preprocessing strategy of the fMRI BOLD data appropriately corrected for motion artifact for the current study’s analyses of time-varying FC. \n\n\n### Spatial Characterization of States \n  \nTo spatially characterize the derived states, we thresholded the activity maps of each state to include the top 40% of both positive and negative activations. We then spatially overlapped each state with the 10 resting-state networks described in (Smith et al.,  ) to obtain an overlap index for each network. The index was calculated by counting the number of voxels that were included in the thresholded map and then dividing these by the size of the resting-state network under consideration in order to account for size bias. \n\n\n### Canonical Correlation Analysis \n  \nTo relate the behavioral measures to static and time-varying FC we used CCA ( ). CCA finds correlations between multidimensional data wherein potential relationships may be present (Hotelling,  ). This is a more principled approach compared to conducting all potential correlations and correcting for multiple comparisons. Specifically, this analysis finds maximal correlations between two sets of variables, X (  n   × d1) and Y (  n   × d2), where d1 and d2 are the number of variables used in X and Y respectively, and n is the number of observations for each variable. It produces two matrices, A and B, such that the variables U = AX and V = BY are maximally related. CCA values were obtained from the MATLAB   canoncorr   function. It is worth noting that like the PCA, this function can produce more than one mode, with each mode ranked by the covariance that can be explained between X and Y. \n  \nMethodology Overview. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was performed on two different datasets, which were matched for measures of behavior but differed with regard to the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) data included. The first CCA (A) included measures of static FC (i.e., the node-to-node connectivity strength), while the second CCA (B) included measures of time-varying FC. Measures of time-varying FC were derived by fitting a hidden Markov model to the BOLD time series. \n  \nWe conducted two separate CCAs. First, we designated the factors of the behavioral data as Y, and the edgewise static FC strength as X (  n   = 96,141). In a second CCA, Y remained the same, but we varied X. Specifically, we designated X as the fractional occupancy of each HMM state (  n   = 12) and temporally defined metastate (  n   = 3), as well as the mean switching rate across states (  n   = 1) and metastates (  n   = 1) separately. As a final preprocessing step, the dimensionality of the static FC data was reduced using PCA as described in Smith et al. ( ), retaining the top 13 components. No dimensionality reduction was required for the HMM data as the number of variables was low. However, we performed an analysis of the HMM data by using PCA and reported the results in the   (Figure S4) where it can be seen that the results are highly similar to the case in which PCA is not employed. \n\nStatistical significance of the CCA analyses was estimated as follows. We calculated 10,000 permutations of the rows of X relative to Y, respecting the within-participant structure of the data, and recalculated the CCA mode for each permutation in order to build a distribution of canonical variate pair correlation values (i.e., <U, V>). By comparing the outcome from the CCA of the true data to the shuffled data, we found that each   discovered with the true data was highly significant (  p   < 1/10,000). In addition, a cross-validation approach was adopted in order to assess the robustness of the discovered mode(s) (as described in Smith et al.,  ). Across 1,000 runs, we ran CCA on a randomly selected set of 80% of the data, respecting the within-participant nature of the data, and stored the resultant U and V. We then estimated the mode on the heldout 20% of data and determined the significance of the estimated mode employing the same permutation significance testing procedure as before. These estimated modes were found to be highly significant, with the correlation between the derived canonical weight vectors in the test dataset being very robust (replicating the results from Smith et al.,  ). \n\nPost hoc correlations of the values of X (Y-respective) with the columns of the significant mode U (V-respective) were used to quantify the contributions (positively or negatively) of each behavioral measure with the CCA mode. In other words, we quantified the extent to which the Y variables were loaded/weighted on the CCA mode. There is no clear cutoff at which one finds a significant correlation value and thus correlation values are reported in isolation. \n\n\n### Validation of CCA Analysis \n  \nWe validated the identified CCA modes by comparing outcomes across a range of behavioral factors (behavior) and FC principal components (static FC, time-varying FC). The number of behavioral factors ranged from 1 to 9, while the number of static FC principal components ranged from 1 to 20 and the number of time-varying FC principal components ranged from 1 to 17 (see Supporting Information). For the static case, we ran CCA on each combination and stored the resulting post hoc correlations for each behavioral measure (i.e., with respect to FC), and computed the Pearson correlation between these values across all 180 combinations (  and  ). For combinations that included two or more behavioral factors, we found that the discovered canonical covariate modes were highly similar, with Pearson correlations tending to be very highly positive (i.e., greater than   r   = 0.90) as well as very highly negative (i.e., less than   r   = −0.90). This bimodal distribution at the extremes of the correlation range indicates that the discovered modes were highly preserved in structure (i.e., the same behavioral measures loaded highly). We determined the optimal combination (i.e., 8 behavioral factors, 13 FC PCs) by selecting either (A) the most significant canonical covariate pair (i.e., U × V), or (B) in cases where multiple pairs had the same maximal 1/10,000 permutation significance value, determining if combinations were highly similar after a certain number of factors or components were included, and then taking the smallest number of factors and components that produced this outcome, restricted by those that had a significant permutation value. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Factor Analysis \n  \nBrain and behavioral data were obtained as described in the Methods. We used factor analysis to reduce the 31 behavioral measures to 8 factors ( ). The first factor, referred to as “Processing Reaction Time,” had DSST median and standard deviation reaction time measures for both match and nonmatch trials loading highly positively. The second factor was referred to as “Task General” because it contained a mixture of measures across multiple tasks, with positive loadings from the Spatial WM task percent accuracy (match trials), the Stroop task percent accuracy, and “Anxious” on the VAS, and negative loadings on the Stroop task median reaction time and the DSST percent accuracy (both match and nonmatch trials). The third factor, referred to as “Working Memory Reaction Time,” had the Spatial WM task median and standard deviation reaction time measures, for both match and nonmatch trials, loading highly positively. The fourth factor, referred to as ”Working Memory Precision Reaction Time,” had two Color WM task measures loading highly positively: median and standard deviation of reaction time. The fifth factor, referred to as “Affect,” had the VAS measures “Sad” and “Happy” loading highly positively and negatively, respectively. The sixth factor, referred to as “Processing Accuracy,” had only the DSST percent accuracy on match trials loading highly positively. The seventh factor, referred to as “Arousal,” had high positive loadings for both the “Drowsy” and “Jittery” VAS measures. Finally, the eighth factor, referred to as “Impulsivity,” included high positive loadings of all three BIS measures. \n\nThe first (“Processing Reaction Time”), third (“Working Memory Reaction Time”), and fourth (“Working Memory Precision Reaction Time”) factors all contain measures of both the median and standard deviation of reaction time across the DSST, Spatial WM, and Color WM tasks, respectively, and therefore reflect aspects of within-task stability (median reaction time) and within-task variability (standard deviation of reaction time). In contrast, the second (“Task General”) and sixth (“Processing Accuracy”) factors only contain task measures of accuracy and/or median reaction time, and thus only reflect aspects of within-task stability. Last, the fifth (“Affect”), seventh (“Arousal”), and eighth (“Impulsivity”) factors all contain measures that reflect the personality and mood of the participant. \n\n\n### Canonical Correlation Analysis: Static Functional Connectivity \n  \nCCA was used to find a mode of population covariation between behavior and static FC. The CCA included the behavioral data in 8-factor space, as well the static rsFC data in 13-principal component space, based on the validation we performed (see the “ ” section of the   for details). The CCA revealed a single mode of covariation between these two datasets ( ). To assess the statistical significance of the discovered modes of covariation, we followed the permutation and cross-validation procedure as outlined in Smith and colleagues ( ; also see “ ” section in   and   and   in this article). \n  \nCanonical Correlation Analysis—Static Functional Connectivity. (A) CCA can discover as many modes of covariation as the lowest rank of each dataset (i.e., 8 behavioral factors). Statistical significance was found only for the first discovered mode. (B) Additional cross-validation of the discovered mode revealed that the first mode was statistically robust across the majority of the 1,000 folds. (C) Post hoc correlations for the discovered mode and the 8 behavioral factors revealed that measures of “Affect” and “Impulsivity,” as well as a “Task General” factor, dictated the structure of the mode. RT, reaction time. \n  \nWe used post hoc correlations between the discovered mode and the behavioral factors to evaluate the contribution of each factor to the mode, with respect to the static FC data. This mode was defined by highly positive weights for the “Affect” (  r   = 0.69), “Task General” (  r   = 0.54), and “Working Memory Precision Reaction Time” (  r   = 0.30) factors, and a highly negative weight for the “Impulsivity” (  r   = −0.30) factor. All other factors had correlation values below an absolute value of 0.11. These results indicate that static connectivity might encode more general behavioral and personality features rather than information that may relate more to task, or trial-specific, behavior. \n\n\n### Canonical Correlation Analysis:  \n  \nWe next assessed whether any relationships existed between time-varying FC and behavior. To quantify the time-varying FC profile in each participant we fit the resting-state BOLD data with a HMM. This model works by finding relevant states and their associated spatial (activity, connectivity) and temporal (fractional occupancy, switching rate) characteristics (see the “ ” section in the  ). After fitting the HMM, we identified 12 states that were representative of brain dynamics across all participants ( ). Previous work has shown that the transition probabilities between HMM states derived from resting-state data is structured (Vidaurre et al.,  ). Specifically, there are certain sets of states, or “metastates,” that are more temporally coherent than others. In other words, if a participant visits a state within one metastate they are more likely to stay within that metastate compared to transitioning to another metastate. Hierarchically clustering the transition probability matrix resulted in three main clusters. One included two states, another included nine states, and the third included a single state. These results are similar to those found previously with the Human Connectome Project dataset (Vidaurre et al.,  ), indicating that even with our comparatively small sample size, we could reliably estimate brain dynamics. For completeness, we included all 12 states in our analysis; however, our results remained unchanged when we excluded the state that failed to cluster with the other states. \n  \nMetastates Resulting from the Temporal Clustering of Brain Dynamics. Probability, across all participants, of transitioning from one state to another. Clustering of the 12-state transition probability matrix revealed a temporal hierarchy wherein groups of states preferentially transitioned within groupings compared to across groupings. Two groupings contained multiple states (i.e., “metastates”), while one state was clustered only with itself. \n  \nNext, we used the fractional occupancy (i.e., time spent in each state) of each state and metastate, as well as the mean switching rate between states and metastates (  n   = 17 in total), as input into a CCA to determine the relationship between time-varying FC characteristics and the behavioral factors (  n   = 8; see   for description of selection and validation process). We found two significant CCA modes by using the same permutation testing and cross-validation procedure as employed for static FC ( ). \n  \nCanonical correlation analysis: time-varying functional connectivity. (A) CCA performed on measures of time-varying FC revealed two significant modes of covariation. Results of the cross-validation procedure and post hoc correlations between (B) mode 1 and (C) mode 2 revealed that both modes were highly robust (assessed across 1,000 folds) and were sensitive to different sets of behavioral features. Whereas mode 1 largely matched the mode discovered with static measures of FC, mode 2 was instead sensitive to task- and trial-specific measures of behavior. RT, reaction time. \n  \nThe first mode was defined by positive weights for “Task General” (  r   = 0.58), “Affect” (  r   = 0.51), “Arousal” (  r   = 0.45), and “Processing Reaction Time” (  r   = 0.26) factors, showing a similar pattern to the mode obtained from static FC ( ). Specifically, “Task General” and “Affect” loaded highest, while “Impulsivity” (  r   = −0.10) loaded most negatively (although its loading was greatly reduced compared to the previously discovered static mode). All other loadings fell below an absolute value of 0.09. \n\nThe second mode exhibited different behavioral weights when compared to the first time-varying mode. Here, “Task General” (  r   = 0.28), “Affect” (  r   = 0.07), and “Arousal” (  r   = −0.14) factors had substantially lower weights. Instead, “Processing Reaction Time” (  r   = 0.45) and “Working Memory Precision Reaction Time” (  r   = 0.37) factors loaded most highly on the positive end, while the “Processing Accuracy” (  r   = −0.71) factor loaded most negatively ( ). All remaining factors had weights below an absolute value of 0.15. \n\nSimilar to a previous analysis on the differentiable contributions of static and time-varying FC (Liégeois et al.,  ), we found that time-varying FC, while showing some similar relationships to behavior as static FC, could also distinguish relationships with more task-based measures of behavior. However, by using more specific measures of working memory (i.e., match-to-sample vs. free recall, accuracy vs. reaction time), task processing, and cognitive control, we were additionally able to determine that the second time-varying CCA mode distinguished unique behaviors associated with task performance. Specifically, the mode was defined by a separation (i.e., a positive-negative split in post hoc correlations) between reaction time and accuracy, thus revealing within-task effects that previously had not been interrogated. The robustness of these time-varying FC results are largely confirmed when compared to a phase-randomized surrogate analysis (see  ). \n\nTo further characterize each state obtained from the HMM, we overlapped their spatial profiles with those of canonical rsFC networks (Smith et al.,  ). Qualitatively, we found that the two-state metastate overlapped with two distinct task-positive networks (i.e., fronto-parietal and somatomotor networks;  ). The nine-state metastate overlapped with a larger variety of networks, including the default-mode, executive, and visual networks ( ). Unthresholded spatial maps of each of the 12 states can be found in the   (Figure S5). \n  \nHidden Markov Model (HMM) State Activation Map Overlap with Resting-State Networks Voxel overlap proportion for each HMM-derived state to the 10 resting-state independent component analysis (ICA) maps from (Smith et al.,  ). Ordering of states matches that of  . Specifically, states 1 and 2 clustered together in one metastate, states 3–11 in another metastate, and state 12 clustered alone. \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nUsing CCA, we investigated the relationship between complex measures of human behavior and both static and time-varying rsFC. We found a single CCA mode between the behavioral measures and static FC. In contrast, we found two CCA modes relating behavior and time-varying FC. Of these two modes, the first one resembled its static counterpart, while the other appeared to be distinct in that it was more sensitive to measures of task-specific behavioral variability. We thus argue that time-varying FC describes nuanced brain–behavior relationships distinctly from that which is captured by static FC. \n\nMeasures of static FC typically consider average FC over a prolonged period of time (e.g., several minutes of an fMRI scan) and have been used extensively to study the functional organization of the brain during rest and task performance (Cole et al.,  ; Cohen & D’Esposito,  ). We used nodal bidirectional FC edge strength quantified across the entire scan in a CCA to relate the brain’s intrinsic static functional organization to behavior. The CCA revealed a significant relationship between these measures and our behavioral factors. Measures of affect and impulsivity determined the main positive and negative directions of this mode, respectively. To a lesser extent, the positive direction of this mode was also characterized by a “Task General” factor. This factor represents accuracy measures derived from tasks sensitive to working memory (Spatial WM), cognitive control (Stroop), and processing speed (DSST). This factor also contains a high loading for the median reaction time measure from the Stroop task. The “Task General” factor is thus most similar to previous analyses that have used data from the Human Connectome Project in which behavioral measures include median reaction times either in isolation or multiplexed with task-specific performance values. These results indicate that static FC likely tracks participant-level personality measures present during the scanning session (e.g., affective state). Unsurprisingly, static connectivity is also sensitive to measures of task performance that likely characterize stable behavioral features of the individual (i.e., general, multitask performance, including working memory). As such, these results largely confirm the findings of previous studies on static rsFC’s predictive power in regard to certain measures of human behavior. \n\nHowever, it has been shown that FC, including measures from resting-state protocols, is likely a dynamic process whereby fluctuations in regional connectivity occur rapidly (Lurie et al.,  ). Given the rate at which they occur, these fluctuations might better encode behavioral information reflecting ongoing cognitive demands, as compared to a general characteristic which would remain stable over the span of minutes, hours, or days. Previously, (Casorso et al.,  ) assessed a similar, albeit broader, hypothesis by extracting time-varying rsFC components and submitting these to a CCA along with behavioral measures collected in the Human Connectome Project. Two modes of covariation were found between their time-varying components and behavior; however, no analysis of static FC was made against which to compare. One mode was largely defined by positive post hoc correlation values for vocabulary comprehension and working memory, and negative values for prosocial behaviors. The second mode was defined by positive post hoc correlation values for visuospatial orienting and emotional processing, and negative values for inter- and intrapersonal processing and well-being. Although a critical step forward in the analysis and validation of time-varying FC’s relevance to human behavior, this study did not address the nature of how time-varying FC relates to behavior in a unique manner compared to static FC measures. Specifically, the Human Connectome Project behavioral measures used preclude the ability to measure processes that likely vary from trial to trial, as task-specific measures of reaction time only reflect the median, and not trialwise variability. In our experiment, we recorded behavioral measures that separately tracked processes related to stable (e.g., accuracy) vs. time-varying (e.g., reaction time) aspects of behavior to better assess our hypothesis. Although reaction time variability and accuracy measures never loaded highly together on any factor, it should be noted that our two measures of reaction time (i.e., median and standard deviation) loaded together on the three factors representing working memory and processing speed reaction times. Even so, the high loading of reaction time variability measures in these factors represents a novel behavioral measure compared to previous reports using publicly available datasets. \n\nUsing measures of time-varying FC calculated from fitting an HMM to our rsFC data, we investigated whether CCA would reveal modes of population covariation sensitive to measures of behavioral variability. Our analysis resulted in two significant modes. One mode largely resembled the mode discovered with static measures of FC. The primary difference between these modes is that this time-varying FC mode carried a highly positive weight for measures of drowsiness and fatigue, potentially reflecting a sensitivity of time-varying FC to neural and physiological correlates of arousal (Patanaik et al.,  ). \n\nWhereas one of the time-varying modes reflected a largely similar, but not identical, behavioral profile as the static FC mode, the other time-varying mode reflected a more unique behavioral profile. High positive weights were associated with response time measures for tasks that assessed working memory and processing speed, while a strong negative weight was found for the measure of accuracy on the processing speed task. Characterized in part by measures of trial-by-trial response variability, this mode’s positive end potentially reflects a greater sensitivity to behavioral dynamics that occur on a more rapid timescale compared to what static FC is likely sensitive. In addition, the separation of measures of response variability and overall response accuracy, especially within the same task, reveals that time-varying FC is likely capable of disentangling unique behavioral components within the same task. Although our static FC mode did show some sensitivity to a measure that captures response variability, the distinction between stable and time-varying components of behavior was not present as is seen in our second time-varying mode. Overall, it is possible that this time-varying mode captures the relationship between brain dynamics and the measures of trial-by-trial behavioral variability within complex measures of human behavior. \n\nThe manner by which time-varying fluctuations in rsFC relate to independent measures of human behavior remains unresolved. It is known that the spatial organization of functional connections changes in response to different tasks compared to rest (Cole et al.,  ; Cohen & D’Esposito,  ). Specifically, internetwork connectivity is more predominant during tasks that require flexible cognition (i.e., working memory) compared to more rudimentary tasks such as finger tapping. Moreover, a previous report found that measures of global network integration and within-network connectivity (i.e., participation coefficient and module degree, respectively), when assessed in a time-varying manner, varied throughout the performance of tasks and tracked the cognitive complexity of the task demands (Shine et al.,  ). Thus, one hypothesis as to how resting dynamics relate to behavior is that the dynamic interactions within and between these networks observed during tasks can be recapitulated during periods of wakeful rest. However, it should be noted that the dynamic interactions that occur during task performance are likely more constrained than during rest due to the confined cognitive context required by task performance. Resting-state dynamics can serve as a “baseline” repertoire that can potentially index the extent to which FC reconfigures during task and, in turn, track behavioral performance (Liégeois et al.,  ). It will be crucial for future studies on the behavioral relevance of time-varying FC to assess this possibility. \n\nIt is also important to emphasize the spatiotemporal signature of these time-varying network interactions and what it means for behavioral performance. Methods such as the HMM investigate brain dynamics with high temporal resolution, thus extending previous methods showing reconfiguration of connectivity between different task blocks (Cohen,  ). For example, Vidaurre et al. ( ) used an HMM to show how a motor task drives reconfiguration of large-scale networks on a timepoint-by-timepoint basis showing that task execution happens at faster timescales that had been previously undetected when interrogated using sliding window methods (Vidaurre et al.,  ). Regarding the spatial profile of the current HMM states, a visual and quantitative assessment of their overlap with canonical rsFC networks (Smith et al.,  ) suggested that our metastates had distinct spatial profiles. We identified a nine-state metastate spanning multiple networks including fronto-parietal, executive, default-mode, and visual networks. Integration of the “task-positive” and “task-negative” networks has been observed during motor tapping and autobiographical planning, suggesting a more mutually compatible role than previously believed (Fox et al.,  ), one that can facilitate goal-directed cognition (Spreng et al.,  ; Braga et al.,  ; Vatansever et al.,  ). On the other hand, the two-state metastate we identified, characterized by a more constrained spatial profile of fronto-parietal and somatomotor networks, potentially reflects networks specific to task execution. The differences in spatial topography of the two-state versus nine-state metastates may provide insight regarding the different behavioral relationships we found with static versus time-varying FC. The flexible interaction of activity across each metastate’s respective individual states might allow for the encoding of information to which static measures are insensitive. Although static measures are capable of reflecting multinetwork interactions, they are incapable of tapping into the specific temporal patterns through which these network interactions occur. Further investigation of the spatial patterns of these states is needed. \n\nIn conclusion, the current study demonstrates that static and time-varying FC are differentially associated with behavior. We argue that via integration across multiple networks at different temporal scales, time-varying FC is associated with both trial-by-trial and stable behavioral measures, while static FC is associated with participant-level personality measures and measures of stable task-general performance. These results demonstrate that it is important for future studies to look at both the static and temporal aspects of FC to more fully delineate the behavioral contributions of each. \n\n\n## SUPPORTING INFORMATION \n  \nSupporting information for this article is available at  . \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nAdam Eichenbaum: Conceptualization; Formal analysis; Investigation; Methodology; Visualization; Writing - Original Draft; Writing - Review & Editing.

Here, we combine graph theory and dynamic functional connectivity to compare resting-state functional MRI data from awake volunteers, propofol-anaesthetised volunteers, and patients with disorders of consciousness, in order to identify consciousness-specific patterns of brain function. We demonstrate that cortical networks are especially affected by loss of consciousness during temporal states of high integration, exhibiting reduced functional diversity and compromised informational capacity, whereas thalamo-cortical functional disconnections emerge during states of higher segregation. Spatially, posterior regions of the brain’s default mode network exhibit reductions in both functional diversity and integration with the rest of the brain during unconsciousness. These results show that human consciousness relies on spatio-temporal interactions between brain integration and functional diversity, whose breakdown may represent a generalisable biomarker of loss of consciousness, with potential relevance for clinical practice. \n  \nHow do diversity (entropy) and integration of activity across brain regions interact to support consciousness? Here the authors show that anaesthetised individuals and patients with disorders of consciousness exhibit overlapping reductions in both diversity and integration in the brain’s default mode network. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe brain is a remarkably complex system, with activity patterns poised at a near-critical point between order and chaos , integrating inputs from different modalities into a unified experience of the world. Recent scientific theories of consciousness have appealed to these characteristics to explain how the diverse repertoire of human conscious experiences arises from brain function . \n\nSpecifically, consciousness is thought to require brain-wide information broadcasting by a “global workspace”, whereby segregated component processes are integrated and made available for undertaking higher cognitive functions, producing a unitary experience . Indeed, estimates of brain integration derived from graph theory  are reduced in brain networks under propofol anaesthesia  and in patients with disorders of consciousness . \n\nIn information theory, entropy quantifies the diversity or unpredictability of information content . Using the entropy of different aspects of brain function to estimate the diversity of information, various studies have shown reduced entropy when consciousness fades, such as during sleep or anaesthesia , and more recently also in patients with disorders of consciousness . Conversely, entropy increases during states of putatively enhanced consciousness induced by psychedelics (see Carhart-Harris (2018) for a recent review), supporting the idea that entropy, as measured from functional imaging, may reflect the richness and diversity of conscious experiences. \n\nThe influential integrated information theory identifies consciousness with a quantity Φ, combining integration and diversity of information within a system . Studies using a proxy for Φ based on the evoked EEG response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), known as perturbational complexity index, have been highly successful at discriminating between different states of consciousness, including anaesthesia and disorders of consciousness . These studies demonstrate that diversity and integration are both relevant for consciousness, and raise the question of how they relate to each other neurobiologically. In particular, although the activity and connectivity of integrative hubs, such as the posterior cingulate/precuneus and other regions of the default mode network (DMN) are highly affected by loss of consciousness , a recent study reported that the entropy of the DMN and other higher-order cortices were only minimally affected by propofol anaesthesia . \n\nTo address this discrepancy, here we relate voxel-level measures of integration and entropy derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), to identify any regions showing consistent alterations in both quantities when consciousness is lost. If both entropy and integration are related to consciousness, then we should expect their alterations during unconsciousness to show some overlap in the brain, thereby identifying regions whose function is most relevant for consciousness. \n\nMoreover, brain functions vary over time , exhibiting dynamics that have recently been shown to differ between states of consciousness in both anaesthetized non-human primates  and human patients with disorders of consciousness . In awake healthy volunteers, the dynamics of brain functional connectivity have been shown to transition between states displaying higher segregation or integration , with the latter being related to higher arousal and improved cognitive performance. Thus, the interplay of brain entropy and integration in supporting consciousness may occur temporally as well as spatially, and we set out to investigate this hypothesis. \n\nA further consideration is that there are multiple ways in which loss of consciousness may occur, whether through pharmacological interventions having widespread effects on brain function, or hypoxic-ischemic injuries affecting cortical and subcortical regions of the brain, or relatively localised traumatic brain injuries. In order to identify neurobiological signatures of loss of consciousness that are generalisable across these multiple conditions, rather than being specific to any of them, here we investigate alterations in brain functions and dynamics during unconsciousness arising in common from all of the above-mentioned causes. Specifically, we compare brain measures of 16 healthy volunteers while awake and while undergoing deep anaesthesia with the common intravenous agent propofol, and we also compare the same 16 awake volunteers with 22 patients diagnosed with a disorder of consciousness (DOC; unresponsive wakefulness syndrome/vegetative state (UWS) or minimally conscious state, MCS) as a result of traumatic or hypoxic/ischemic brain injury. \n\nFocusing on results that are common across the two datasets, we demonstrate that in both DOC patients and healthy volunteers undergoing propofol anaesthesia, measures of brain functional diversity and integrative capacity are related in both space and time, and their interactions are altered during unconsciousness. Furthermore, brain dynamics are also altered during unconsciousness: temporal states of high integration exhibit reduced integration and functional diversity in unconscious individuals, unlike predominantly segregated states. Additionally, thalamo-cortical disconnections become evident during temporal states of high segregation, whereas highly integrated states are primarily characterised by altered cortico-cortical connectivity; thus, our results contribute to reconcile discrepant findings in the literature about the relative roles of cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity for consciousness . Finally, we show that in both datasets, whole-brain connectivity and temporal entropy are both reduced in key regions of the brain’s default mode network. By combining different biological approaches with diverse analytical methods investigating both spatial and temporal aspects of brain function, these results advance our understanding of conscious and unconscious states in the human brain, and their underlying brain dynamics. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Reduced global integration and functional diversity \n  \nTo determine how integration and entropy interact spatially, we quantified the regional distribution of unconsciousness-related changes in these metrics across the brain. We first investigated how loss of consciousness affected the global functional connectivity of each region with the rest of the brain, which we took as reflecting its capacity for global integration. We estimated this with the Intrinsic Connectivity Contrast (ICC), a voxel-wise measure that uses graph theory to quantify each voxel’s whole-brain connectivity, computed as the sum of the squared Pearson correlation between that voxel’s timeseries and the timeseries of every other voxel in the brain . \n\nBoth localised decreases and increases in ICC were evident under deep propofol anaesthesia (Supplementary Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ), with prominent reductions in posterior cingulate/precuneus (PCC/PCU), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), left angular gyrus (AG) and left supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and medial temporal lobe (MTL). Increases were primarily localised in the bilateral caudate, and bilateral pre- and postcentral gyri. \n\nAnalogous results were observed when comparing the healthy volunteer cohort during their awake scan and the DOC patients (Supplementary Fig.  ). ICC reductions were evident in PCC/PCU, left AG, mPFC, bilateral MTL, supramarginal gyri (SMG), opercular, postcentral and inferior parietal cortices, right fusiform and inferior temporal cortex (Supplementary Table  ). Increases were localised in the hippocampal formations, cerebellum, and bilateral caudate; the latter was shared with the propofol dataset (Supplementary Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ). \n\nWe then quantified functional diversity as the sample entropy (SampEn) of voxelwise blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal timeseries  (see Methods). Sample entropy, which is derived from Approximate Entropy (ApEn) , is an approximation of Kolmogorov complexity for timeseries and is stable even for data sequences of limited length, such as fMRI timeseries . SampEn quantifies how unpredictable a signal is, such that low values of SampEn would indicate that the signal is highly stereotyped - with a perfectly predictable series, such as [1,1,1,…] having a SampEn of zero, and SampEn increasing as the series becomes more disordered . \n\nWidespread reductions in BOLD signal entropy were observed under anaesthesia, localised in the PCC/PCU, left AG extending to MTL and inferior parietal, and left middle and inferior frontal gyri. No increases were observed (Supplementary Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ). Crucially, reductions in BOLD signal entropy overlapped with ICC reduction due to anaesthesia in PCC/PCU, left AG and left SMG (Fig.  , left panel). Likewise, DOC patients showed extensive sample entropy reductions in PCC/PCU and mPFC, as well as bilateral AG extending to inferior parietal, left inferior and middle and right middle and superior frontal cortices, and inferior and medial temporal lobes, including fusiform gyri and hippocampal formations (Supplementary Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ). Again, these entropy reductions largely overlapped with ICC reductions in our group of patients (Fig.  , right panel).   \nBrain maps of consciousness-related reductions in intrinsic connectivity contrast (ICC, reflecting integrative capacity) and sample entropy (reflecting functional diversity over time), and their overlaps between and within datasets. Regions in blue display reduced ICC during unconsciousness (increases are shown in Supplementary Figs.   and  ); yellow indicates reduced sample entropy during unconsciousness; and red indicates regions showing both reduced entropy and ICC. Overlaps between anaesthesia (left) and DOC (right) are shown in the middle. Images are shown on medial and lateral surfaces of a smoothed standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI-152) structural T1 scan, in neurological convention \n  \n\nAlthough sample entropy requires the choice of two parameters   m   and   r   (see Methods), entropy results were robust to parameter choices (Supplementary Fig.  ). However, the use of a smaller smoothing kernel did result in fewer and smaller clusters of significantly different SampEn (Supplementary Fig.  ). In particular, the left SMG cluster disappeared when comparing awake and anaesthetised individuals, and the left angular gyrus cluster was substantially reduced in size. Nevertheless, the precuneus cluster was maintained, despite the reduced size, further highlighting the specific importance of the default mode network. \n\nIn order to exclude the effect of subject motion as a possible confounding factor, we also compared the sample entropy of the head motion signals (three translations and three rotations) between the awake healthy controls and the two conditions of unconsciousness, using the same parameters as for the brain entropy analysis described above. Although a significant reduction in the entropy of the head motion in the horizontal plane was observed when comparing DOC patients to controls (Supplementary Table  ), this was not the case for deep propofol anaesthesia, where instead an increase in the entropy of the timeseries of rotations around the vertical axis was observed, compared with the awake condition (Supplementary Table  ). \n\nTo characterise the consciousness-specific alterations of entropy and integration in the spatial domain, we then computed the overlaps between propofol- and brain injury-induced unconsciousness. The posterior cingulate/precuneus, left angular gyrus and left supramarginal gyrus showed reductions in both sample entropy and ICC, for both anaesthesia and disorders of consciousness (Fig.  , central panel). To establish the spatial extent of connectivity changes we carried out follow-up seed-based analysis from these regions , which showed that during unconsciousness the connections between PCC and angular gyrus with the frontal portions of the DMN were attenuated, as were their anticorrelations with fronto-parietal control networks (FPN), in line with previous evidence ; reduced DMN-FPN anticorrelation was also observed from the SMG, which is part of the FPN (Supplementary Figs.  – ). \n\n\n### Dynamic functional connectivity alterations \n  \nSince consciousness is believed to require a global workspace, integrating relevant information from separate modules , we then applied dynamic functional connectivity analysis  to identify temporal states of high integration and high segregation , and to investigate how loss of consciousness influenced their probability of occurrence and their functional diversity. \n\nFollowing the approach of Shine et al. , the integrated and segregated states were identified by using a machine learning algorithm, known as k-means clustering, to separate subject- and session-specific sliding windows of dynamic functional connectivity (FC) into two clusters; these were then labelled as the “predominantly integrated” and “predominantly segregated” clusters, based on their graph-theoretical properties of participation coefficient and within-module degree Z-score , and each cluster was summarised by one centroid matrix of functional connectivity (see Methods). \n\nHaving computed the dynamic states of integration and segregation, we were able to investigate whether each state was similarly altered during unconsciousness induced by anaesthesia and injury, in terms of its pattern of functional connections (Methods). For comparison purposes, we also carried out these analyses for what we term “static” FC (spanning the entire scan duration; Fig.   and Supplementary Fig.  ).   \nCommon differences in functional connectivity (  r   values) when considering both awake volunteers > anaesthetized (repeated-measures   t  -test, FDR-corrected), and awake volunteers > DOC patients (two-samples   t  -test, FDR-corrected).   a   Differences from static FC (computed over the entire scanning length).   b   Differences from dynamic FC, observed only in the integrated state (left) or only in the segregated state (right). Hot colours indicate conscious > unconscious, and cold indicate unconscious > conscious (increased correlation, or decreased anticorrelation). Source data are provided as a Source Data file \n  \n\nIn line with previous work, the overall picture from static FC revealed disconnections between the bilateral thalami and the precuneus , disconnections within DMN regions, reduced anticorrelations between DMN and FPN (showing as unconscious > conscious) , and within-FPN connectivity increases. Dynamic analysis of states that were partitioned as primarily integrated or primarily segregated revealed that alterations in cortico-cortical connectivity were primarily observed during the integrated state, whereas thalamo-cortical disconnections (left-lateralised) were specific to the predominantly segregated state (Fig.   and Supplementary Fig.  ). \n\n\n### Temporal integration \n  \nTo identify the role of temporal integration in consciousness, we investigated how loss of consciousness affected the time spent in each state. For each individual, we computed the proportion of dynamic matrices assigned to each state, out of the total number (as there were only two states, the two analyses are complementary, and only one is reported). Contrary to our expectation, time spent in the predominantly integrated state was not significantly different between awake (  M     =   0.61,   SD     =   0.09) and anaesthetized volunteers (  M     =   0.55,   SD     =   0.12),   t   (15) = 1.79,   g     =   0.56,   p     =   0.093 (repeated-measures   t  -test). Likewise, the awake volunteers did not significantly differ from the DOC patients (  M     =   0.63,   SD     =   0.13,   t   (36) = −0.50,   g     =   −0.16,   p     =   0.623 (two-samples   t  -test; Supplementary Fig.  ). \n\n\n### Optimal information capacity \n  \nHowever, we reasoned that unconsciousness may also alter the network properties of the brain during each individual state of time-resolved functional connectivity. We used the graph-theoretical property of small-worldness to investigate this possibility (Methods). Small-world networks allow for cost-efficient organisation, by maximising local communication and minimising costly long-distance connections, thus balancing integration and segregation . This measure is therefore often employed to estimate the optimality of a network’s information capacity . \n\nWhen considering FC calculated over the entire run, we observed a reduction in network small-worldness between the awake volunteers (  M     =   2.21,   SD     =   0.22) and DOC patients (  M     =   1.97,   SD     =   0.36,   t  (36) = 2.31,   g     =   0.74,   p     =   0.028, two-samples   t  -test); however, the healthy volunteers when anaesthetized did not show significant differences in small-worldness from when they were awake (  M     =   2.04,   SD     =   0.27,   t   (15) = 2.05,   g     =   0.66,   p     =   0.063, repeated-measures   t  -test). (Fig.  , top left).   \nViolin plots of the mean connectivity entropy (left) and small-world values (right) for the static (  a  ,   b  ), integrated (  c  ,   d  ) and segregated (  e  ,   f  ) states, comparing conscious healthy controls and unconscious individuals due to anaesthesia (repeated_measures   t  -tests) and brain injury (two-samples   t  -tests).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file \n  \n\nNevertheless, adopting a dynamic approach revealed that the integrated state was characterised by reduced small-worldness for both anaesthetised healthy individuals (  M     =   1.90,   SD     =   0.25,   t   (15) = 3.01,   g     =   1.03,   p     =   0.010, repeated-measures   t  -test); and DOC patients (  M     =   1.89,   SD     =   0.26,   t   (36) = 3.41,   g     =   1.10,   p     =   0.002, two-samples   t  -test) when compared to consciousness (  M     =   2.15,   SD     =   0.21) (Fig.   middle left). Conversely, during the segregated state there was no significant difference in small-worldness between the awake individuals (  M     =   2.07,   SD     =   0.24) and either the same individuals under propofol anaesthesia, (  M     =   1.97,   SD     =   0.24,   t   (15) = 1.11,   g     =   0.37,   p     =   0.286, repeated-measures   t  -test) or the DOC patients (  M     =   1.91,   SD     =   0.40,   t   (36) = 1.40,   g     =   0.45,   p     =   0.171, two-samples   t  -test) (Fig.   bottom left). These results were robust to the choice of network node and edge definition, in both datasets—although reduced small-worldness was also observed during the segregated states, when employing liberal thresholds for edge definition (Supplementary Fig.   and Supplementary Tables  – ). \n\n\n### Entropy of temporal states \n  \nWe then investigated whether entropy also showed state-specific alterations during unconsciousness. Whereas voxelwise sample entropy (as discussed earlier) quantifies the unpredictability of the signal from each voxel over time, we also wished to examine a metric that better represented how these changes related to information exchange. To do this, we then tested levels of consciousness based on an alternative measure of brain entropy developed by Saenger et al. , which quantifies how diverse the pattern of connections of each brain region is, in terms of the mean normalised Shannon entropy of each region’s distribution of FC values (“connectivity entropy”; see Methods). \n\nFor FC calculated over the entire run, significantly reduced mean connectivity entropy was observed between the awake (  M     =   0.90,   SD     =   0.01) and deep conditions (  M     =   0.89,   SD     =   0.01,   t   (15) = 2.69,   p     =   0.017,   g     =   0.85, repeated-measures   t  -test; Fig.  , top right). Compared with the awake healthy controls, mean connectivity entropy was also reduced for the DOC patients (  M     =   0.88,   SD     =   0.01,   t   (36) = 3.26,   p     =   0.002,   g     =   1.05, two-samples   t  -test; Fig.  , top right). \n\nNetwork-specific investigations, based on the seven-network parcellation of Yeo et al. , were also performed to identify whether the observed entropy reductions were uniform across the brain, or localised to specific resting-state networks. This analysis revealed that the significant reduction in connectivity entropy under anaesthesia at whole-brain level was reflected by a reduction in DMN regions (Supplementary Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ). In DOC patients, the global effect corresponded to reductions in connectivity entropy of the DMN, but also FPN, dorsal attention, visual and limbic networks (Supplementary Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ). \n\nFurther state-specific analyses provided insight into the temporal origin of differences in connectivity entropy. Significantly reduced mean connectivity entropy was observed in the predominantly integrated state between participants when they were awake (  M     =   0.904,   SD     =   0.007) and anaesthetised (  M     =   0.897,   SD     =   0.010,   t  (15) = 2.22,   p     =   0.046,   g     =   0.80, repeated-measures   t  -test; Fig.  , middle right). This global reduction was reflected by reduced connectivity entropy in the DMN (Supplementary Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ), in line with results from static FC. \n\nMean connectivity entropy in the predominantly integrated state was also reduced for DOC patients (  M     =   0.89,   SD     =   0.01,   t  (36) = 3.43,   p     =   0.002,   g     =   1.10, two-samples   t  -test) when compared with the awake volunteers (Fig.  , middle right). The global reduction in connectivity entropy in the patient group reflected significant reductions in DMN, FPN and limbic networks (Supplementary Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ), reflecting results from static FC. \n\nConversely, no significant reductions in mean connectivity entropy of the predominantly segregated state were observed between awake (  M     =   0.93,   SD     =   0.01) and anaesthetised participants (  M     =   0.92,   SD     =   0.01,   t  (15) = 1.43,   g     =   0.60,   p     =   0.174, repeated-measures   t  -test), either globally or for specific subnetworks (Fig.  , bottom right and Supplementary Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ). Thus, a marked contrast existed between the impact of anaesthesia on connectivity entropy in integrated and segregated states. \n\nInstead, the mean connectivity entropy in the predominantly segregated state was significantly reduced when comparing the awake healthy controls with DOC patients (  M     =   0.91,   SD     =   0.01)   t  (36) = 2.52,   p     =   0.014,   g     =   0.81, two-samples   t  -test. (Fig.  , bottom right). This reduction of global entropy in the segregated state of DOC patients was reflected in reductions in DMN, visual, somatomotor, dorsal attention and limbic networks (Supplementary Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ). \n\n\n### Comparison of different DOC aetiologies \n  \nTo assess whether our results for the DOC patients may be primarily driven by one particular aetiology (traumatic or hypoxic/ischemic brain injury), we repeated the analyses presented above, but including only the DOC patients, divided into two groups comparing DOC patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI;   N   = 10) and patients with hypoxic/ischemic injury (HBI;   N   = 12). No significant differences were observed between the two groups of DOC patients (Supplementary Table   and Supplementary Fig.  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe combined graph theory and dynamic functional connectivity to compare human fMRI data during conscious wakefulness, and during unconsciousness caused by anoxic brain injury, traumatic brain injury, and propofol anaesthesia. To identify general markers of loss of consciousness irrespective of its specific origin, we focused on brain alterations that were common to both datasets. Our results reveal that consciousness relies on the interaction between functional diversity as measured by entropy and integration, in both the spatial and temporal domains. \n\nSpatially, we show that key regions of the default mode network, especially the posterior cingulate/precuneus, exhibit concurrent reductions in integrative capacity and functional diversity, estimated by the intrinsic connectivity contrast (in line with the ICC reductions under sevoflurane reported in other studies ) and sample entropy of BOLD signal timeseries, respectively. The ICC measures the integrative capacity of a given brain region because it reflects changes in either the inputs the region receives, or the outputs it broadcasts—both of which are crucial aspects of the process of integrating information. Being based on functional connectivity, the ICC is agnostic with regard to directionality; however, computational modelling has shown that nodes with high degree, to which ICC is related, tend to be the target of information flow from nodes with lower degree . Thus, our results may suggest that during unconsciousness, cortical hubs in the posterior DMN regions receive less information from the rest of the brain, and consequently exhibit reduced entropy, reflecting reduced informational content and diversity. Since loss of consciousness is expected to compromise the ability to exchange and integrate information from across the cortex in the brain’s global workspace, our results support the identification of the latter at least in part with the DMN. They also support the predictions of integrated information theory, according to which unconsciousness can result from a loss of information and diversity as well as integrative capacity . \n\nIn the temporal domain, the present work advances our knowledge by demonstrating the dynamic nature of DMN involvement in loss of consciousness. For both DOC and anaesthesia the predominantly integrated state, which is related to higher cognitive performance and alertness , was characterised by reduced DMN-FPN anticorrelations. Conversely, disconnections between DMN and thalamus were specific to the predominantly segregated state, and within-DMN connectivity reductions were observed in both states. Thus, the results presented herein refine our understanding of the relative importance of thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical connectivity for consciousness,  by revealing that alterations of DMN cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connections appear to vary dynamically, depending on the brain’s state of integration or segregation. \n\nDynamic FC analysis also revealed interactions between functional diversity and integration in the temporal dimension: the predominantly integrated state appears particularly vulnerable to consciousness-related reductions in the mean Shannon entropy of each region’s pattern of functional connectivity. Although this state was not visited less often during unconsciousness, we did find reduced small-worldness, a measure of information capacity, suggesting that these qualities of the integrated state may be more relevant for consciousness than time spent in it, at least in the context of resting-state data. It is important to bear in mind that applications of small-worldness and other graph-theoretical measures to brain networks are inherently limited by the noisiness of imaging modalities, such as fMRI —a concern that we sought to address in this work by replicating our results pertaining to small-worldness across multiple thresholds, and with different node and edge definitions for our networks. \n\nThe reductions in brain entropy that we observed are consistent with the recent Entropic Brain Hypothesis  and with reports of reduced entropy with diminished consciousness , including using dynamic functional connectivity , but they appear in partial contrast with those of Liu et al. . These authors reported that entropy diminishes in primary sensory systems when transitioning from light to deep propofol sedation, but not in DMN or other higher cognitive systems. However, the present reductions in DMN entropy were obtained from two different measures (spatial and temporal), in both anaesthesia and DOC patients, demonstrating their robustness. Moreover, it has been shown that at propofol doses lower than ~2.7 µg mL , which is when EEG slow-wave activity reaches saturation (SWAS) , the brain is still responsive to external stimuli, despite behavioural unresponsiveness, and thus perceptual awareness is thought to be preserved . Although SWAS cannot be confirmed, since EEG monitoring was not present, the dose of propofol we used was substantially higher than the one used by Liu et al. , and closer to SWAS-inducing level. Thus, preserved and reduced DMN entropy in the two studies may reflect preserved and compromised perceptual awareness, respectively—thereby resolving the apparent discrepancy, in line with extensive evidence relating DMN alterations to unconsciousness, for both anaesthesia  and DOC . \n\nIn the present study, the differences in network properties under anaesthesia—concurring with those observed in patients with DOC—only became apparent in the integrated state of dynamic FC, whereas static FC (i.e., computed over the entire scanning duration) failed to detect them. Indeed, earlier studies using only static FC analysis even reported increased small-worldness under propofol  whereas reduced small-worldness under propofol was later demonstrated using dynamic FC in macaques, consistent with our results . In line with recent work combining graph theory and dynamic functional connectivity to study DOC patients , our results further demonstrate the importance of time-resolved analyses in the study of consciousness, to uncover otherwise hidden similarities between different datasets. \n\nImportantly, this work dealt exclusively with data from resting state scanning, which is known to preferentially recruit the DMN ; there is evidence that under different paradigms other networks, such as the auditory and FPN, are also able to distinguish between conscious and unconscious states . Further work could also relate the present results to independent markers of consciousness, such as SWAS  or naturalistic paradigms , and determine whether they can discriminate between different levels of sedation, or different disorders of consciousness. \n\nIndeed, a limitation of this work is that we have implicitly assumed that both individuals under deep propofol anaesthesia and UWS and MCS patients are unconscious. However, MCS patients owe their classification to occasional signs of volitional behaviour, which may reflect minimal levels of consciousness . Furthermore, disorders of consciousness are prone to relatively high rate of misdiagnosis, with patients categorized as UWS subsequently exhibiting signs of awareness when more sensitive measures are employed . Adding to this complication, dreaming has been reported during anaesthesia in up to 27% of cases . Consequently, despite lack of behavioural responsiveness it is not possible to say conclusively that all individuals examined here were completely unconscious, in the sense of having no subjective experiences. Using additional markers of consciousness, such as SWAS , PCI  or naturalistic paradigms  may be required in future studies to provide additional evidence of unconsciousness independent of behavioural responsiveness. \n\nOther issues of consideration include the scanner hardware and acquisition parameters, which were not identical for the two cohorts discussed in the article. A further confound may be that DOC patients had reduced entropy of motion timeseries in the horizontal plane compared to awake controls, whereas anaesthesia led to increased entropy in the rotation around the vertical axis. Additionally, it is important to consider how the anaesthetic agent can indirectly affect measures of brain activity by altering physiological parameters, such as arterial concentration of carbon dioxide. Since anaesthetized subjects in this study were not intubated but rather spontaneously ventilating, propofol-induced respiratory depression may have resulted in hypoventilation and increased arterial CO  levels. We did not measure end-tidal or arterial CO  concentrations in our subjects. However, propofol only has relatively minor effects on brain hemodynamics , and BOLD fluctuation amplitudes, connectivity strength and the spatial extent of connectivity maps have been shown to be unaffected by hypercapnia during the resting state in rats , thus mitigating this concern. \n\nIn addition to noting that both motion and cardiac, respiratory and physiological noise artefacts are accounted for in our denoising procedure (see Methods), we believe that these concerns should be further mitigated by our decision to adopt a comparative approach in this work, focusing only on results that were observed in both DOC and anaesthesia: if any of the results we observed when comparing DOC patients and controls had been due solely to the differences in acquisition and scanning parameters, or subject motion, such results should not have also been observed under conditions of anaesthesia, where those confounds were not present thanks to the within-subjects design—and vice versa for the concern about hypercapnia during anaesthesia. Moreover, using the same group of awake healthy volunteers as controls for both states of unconsciousness helps to ensure that the results we have found are not confounded by differences in control groups, but rather represent deviations from the same common baseline. Therefore, we expect that the common results we report should represent genuine markers of loss of consciousness, rather than reflecting any idiosyncratic aspects of the specific datasets used here. \n\nOverall, we have demonstrated that loss of consciousness—whether due to propofol anaesthesia, hypoxic/ischemic brain injury, or traumatic brain injury—is accompanied by reduced functional diversity and integrative capacity in the posterior DMN, especially during temporal states of high integration. Additionally, our time-resolved analysis led us to the discovery that the relative importance of cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity in supporting consciousness varies dynamically with the brain’s state of integration or segregation, thereby clarifying a previous point of controversy in the literature. The effects reported were observed in both DOC patients (with no differences between TBI and HBI patients) and healthy volunteers undergoing propofol anaesthesia. This replication increases the robustness of our results, and it allowed us to narrow down on properties of brain function that are likely to be consciousness-specific, whose alterations may, therefore, represent general neurobiological signatures of loss of consciousness, with potential translational value for the detection of consciousness during surgery or in patients with a diagnosis of vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Volunteer recruitment for propofol data collection \n  \nThe propofol data were collected at the Robarts Research Institute in London, Ontario (Canada) between May and November 2014. A total of 19 (18–40 years; 13 males) healthy, right- handed, native English speakers, with no history of neurological disorders were recruited. The Health Sciences Research Ethics Board and Psychology Research Ethics Board of Western University (Ontario, Canada) ethically approved this study, and all relevant ethical guidelines were followed. Each volunteer provided written informed consent, and received monetary compensation for their time. Due to equipment malfunction or physiological impediments to anaesthesia in the scanner, data from three participants (1 male) were excluded from analyses, leaving 16. \n\n\n### Procedure and design for propofol data collection \n  \nResting-state fMRI data were acquired at no sedation (Awake), and Deep sedation (anaesthetised: Ramsay score of 5 ). Ramsay level was independently assessed by two anaesthesiologists and one anaesthesia nurse in the scanning room before fMRI acquisition began, in each condition. Additionally, participants performed two tests: a computerised auditory target-detection task and a memory test of verbal recall, to evaluate their level of wakefulness independently of the assessors. \n\nFor the Awake condition, participants did not receive a Ramsey score, as this scale is designed for patients in critical care. Instead, they had to be fully awake, alert and communicating appropriately. An infrared camera located inside the scanner was used to monitor wakefulness. For the Deep sedation condition, propofol was administered intravenously using an AS50 auto syringe infusion pump (Baxter Healthcare, Singapore); step-wise sedation increments sedation were achieved using an effect-site/plasma steering algorithm combined with the computer-controlled infusion pump. Further manual adjustments were performed as required to reach target concentrations of propofol, as predicted by the TIVA Trainer (European Society for Intravenous Aneaesthesia, eurosiva.eu) pharmacokinetic simulation program. This software also specified the blood concentrations of propofol, following the Marsh 3-compartment model, which were used as targets for the pharmacokinetic model providing target-controlled infusion. The initial propofol target effect-site concentration was 0.6 µg mL , with oxygen titrated to maintain SpO2 above 96%. Concentration was then increased by increments of 0.3 µg mL , and Ramsay score was assessed: if lower than 5, a further increment occurred. Participants were deemed to have reached Ramsay level 5 once they stopped responding to verbal commands, were unable to engage in conversation, and were rousable only to physical stimulation. Data acquisition began once loss of behavioural responsiveness occurred for both tasks, and the three assessors agreed that Ramsay sedation level 5 had been reached. \n\nThe mean estimated effect-site and plasma propofol concentrations were kept stable by the pharmacokinetic model delivered via the TIVA Trainer infusion pump; the mean estimated effect-site propofol concentration was 2.48 (1.82–3.14) µg mL , and the mean estimated plasma propofol concentration was 2.68 (1.92–3.44) µg mL . Mean total mass of propofol administered was 486.58 (373.30–599.86) mg. These values of variability are typical for the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol. Since the sedation procedure did not take place in a hospital setting, airway security could not be ensured by intubation during scanning, although two anaesthesiologists closely monitored each participant. Consequently, scanner time was minimised to ensure return to normal breathing following deep sedation. No state changes or movement were noted during the deep sedation scanning for any of the participants included in the study. \n\nIn the scanner, subjects were instructed to relax with closed eyes, without falling asleep; 8 min of fMRI scan without any task (“resting-state”) were acquired for each participant. Additionally, a separate 5-min long scan was also acquired while a plot-driven story was presented through headphones to participants, who were instructed to listen while keeping their eyes closed. The present analysis focuses on the resting-state data only; the story scan data are not relevant to the work presented here, and will not be discussed further. \n\n\n### Propofol MRI data acquisition \n  \nMRI scanning was performed using a 3-Tesla Siemens Tim Trio scanner (32-channel coil), and 256 functional volumes (echo-planar images, EPI) were collected from each participant, with the following parameters: slices = 33, with 25% inter-slice gap; resolution = 3 mm isotropic; TR = 2000 ms; TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 75 degrees; matrix size = 64 × 64. The order of acquisition was interleaved, bottom-up. Anatomical scanning was also performed, acquiring a high-resolution T1-weighted volume (32-channel coil, 1 mm isotropic voxel size) with a 3D MPRAGE sequence, using the following parameters: TA = 5 min, TE = 4.25 ms, 240 × 256 matrix size, 9 degrees FA. \n\n\n### Preprocessing of propofol fMRI data \n  \nWe preprocessed the functional imaging data using a standard pipeline, implemented within the SPM12-based ( ) toolbox CONN ( ), version 17f . The pipeline comprised the following steps: removal of the first five scans, to allow magnetisation to reach steady state; functional realignment and motion correction; slice-timing correction to account for differences in time of acquisition between slices; identification of outlier scans for subsequent regression by means of the quality assurance/artefact rejection software ART ( ); spatial normalisation to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI-152) standard space with 2 mm isotropic resampling resolution, using the segmented grey matter image from each volunteer’s high-resolution T1-weighted image, together with an a priori grey matter template; spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half-maximum (FWHM). \n\n\n### Denoising of propofol fMRI data \n  \nTo reduce noise due to cardiac and motion artefacts, we applied the anatomical CompCor method of denoising the functional data , also implemented within the CONN toolbox. The anatomical CompCor method involves regressing out of the functional data the following confounding effects: the first five principal components attributable to each individual’s white matter signal, and the first five components attributable to individual cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal; six subject-specific realignment parameters (three translations and three rotations) as well as their first- order temporal derivatives; the artefacts identified by ART  ;   and main effect of scanning condition . Linear detrending was also applied, and the subject-specific denoised BOLD signal timeseries were band-pass filtered to eliminate both low-frequency drift effects and high-frequency noise, thus retaining frequencies between 0.008 and 0.09 Hz. \n\n\n### Recruitment of DOC patients \n  \nA sample of 71 patients with disorders of consciousness was included in this study. Patients were recruited from specialised long-term care centres. To be invited to the study, patients must have had a DOC diagnosis, written informed consent to participation from their legal representative, and were capable of being transported to Addenbrooke’s Hospital. The exclusion criteria included any medical condition that made it unsafe for the patient to participate (decision made by clinical personnel blinded to the specific aims of the study) or any reason they are unsuitable to enter the MRI scanner environment (e.g. non-MRI-safe implants), significant pre-existing mental health problems, or insufficient English pre injury. After admission, each patient underwent clinical and neuroimaging testing. Patients spent a total of five days (including arrival and departure days) at Addenbrooke’s Hospital. Coma recovery scale-revised (CRS-R) assessments were recorded at least daily for the five days of admission. If behaviours were indicative of awareness at any time, patients were classified as MCS; otherwise UWS. We assigned MCS− or MCS+ sub-classification if behaviours were consistent throughout the week. The most frequent signs of consciousness in MCS− patients are visual fixation and pursuit, automatic motor reactions (e.g. scratching, pulling the bed sheet) and localisation to noxious stimulation whereas MCS+ patients can, in addition, follow simple commands, intelligibly verbalise or intentionally communicate . Scanning occurred at the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, between January 2010 and December 2015; medication prescribed to each patient was maintained during scanning. All clinical investigations were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and all relevant ethical guidelines. Ethical approval for testing patients was provided by the National Research Ethics Service (National Health Service, UK; LREC reference 99/391). \n\nAs a focus of this study was on graph-theoretical properties of the brain, patients were systematically excluded from the final cohort analysed in this study based on the following criteria: (1) large focal brain damage (i.e. more than 1/3 of one hemisphere) as stated by an expert in neuroanatomy blinded to the patients’ diagnoses; (2) excessive head motion during resting state scanning (i.e. greater than 3 mm in translation and/or 3 degrees in rotation); (3) suboptimal segmentation and normalization of images. A total of 22 adults (14 males; 17–70 years; mean time post injury: 13 months) meeting diagnostic criteria for Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome/Vegetative State or Minimally Conscious State due to brain injury were included in this study (Table  ).   \nDemographic information for patients with Disorders of Consciousness \n  \n CRS-R   coma recovery scale-revised,   UWS   unresponsive wakefulness syndrome,   MCS   minimally conscious state,   TBI   traumatic brain injury \n  \n\n\n### Patient MRI data acquisition \n  \nResting-state fMRI was acquired for 10 min (300 volumes, TR = 2000 ms) using a Siemens Trio 3 T scanner (Erlangen, Germany). Functional images (32 slices) were acquired using an echo planar sequence, with the following parameters: 3 × 3 × 3.75 mm resolution, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, 78 degrees FA. Anatomical scanning was also performed, acquiring high-resolution T1-weighted images with an MPRAGE sequence, using the following parameters: TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.47 ms, 150 slices, resolution 1 × 1 × 1 mm. \n\n\n### Preprocessing and denoising of patient fMRI data \n  \nDue to the presence of deformations caused by brain injury, rather than relying on automated pipelines, patients’ brains were individually preprocessed using SPM12, with visual inspections after each step. Additionally, to further reduce potential movement artefacts, data underwent despiking with a hyperbolic tangent squashing function. The remaining preprocessing and denoising steps were the same as described above for the propofol data. \n\n\n### Intrinsic connectivity contrast \n  \nThe global connectivity of each voxel with the rest of the brain was analysed using the intrinsic connectivity contrast (ICC)  as implemented in the CONN toolbox. The ICC is a voxelwise measure of whole-brain connectivity based on the graph-theoretical notion of degree, which quantifies the number of connections of a node with other nodes in its network. Consistently with this notion, a higher ICC index corresponds to higher global connectivity. \n\nFor each voxel   i  , where   i  ,   j   are voxels, and   t  (  x  ) is the BOLD fMRI timeseries of voxel   x  . Subsequently, the ICC values in the whole brain are normalised, by subtracting the average ICC value across all voxels from the ICC of each voxel, and then dividing each voxel’s ICC by the standard deviation of the ICC values across all voxels. \n\nThe result is a brain map of voxelwise Intrinsic Connectivity Contrasts, whose distribution is Gaussian with zero mean and unitary variance. These ICC values can then be used as ROIs for further seed-based analysis in a data-driven fashion. As the biological meaning of estimating functional connectivity of a white matter voxel from BOLD data is dubious, the ICC analysis was restricted to grey matter voxels. \n\n\n### Voxelwise sample entropy of BOLD timeseries \n  \nSample entropy (SampEn) estimates the probability that similar sequences of observations in a timeseries will remain similar. To compute SampEn, the timeseries is divided into chunks of   m   timepoints each; chunks are then compared to find the distance between them, calculated as the largest absolute difference between any value in the first chunk and any value in the second chunk (Chebyshev distance). Two chunks are deemed similar if their distance is less than a value   r  . Subsequently, the procedure is repeated for chunks of length   m   + 1. The result is the probability that if two data sequences of length   m   have distance less than   r   (i.e. are similar), then sequences of length   m   + 1 also have distance less than   r  . The negative logarithm of this quantity corresponds to SampEn. Here,   A   is the number of chunks of length   m   + 1 that are similar (have Chebyshev distance less than   r  ), and   B   is the number of chunks of length   m   that are similar. \n\nUnlike Shannon entropy, SampEn depends on the choice of parameters   m   and   r  . Here, we used   m     =   3 and   r     =   0.6 times the standard deviation of the data. These parameter values were identified as optimal for calculation of SampEn from resting-state fMRI data . The entropy of the BOLD signal timeseries was calculated using the Brain Entropy Mapping Toolbox (BENtbx;  )  implemented in MATLAB. Each subject’s preprocessed and denoised resting-state fMRI timeseries were used as inputs for BENtbx. For each subject, the toolbox computed the SampEn of each voxel’s timeseries, producing as output a subject-specific 3D brain map, with an entropy value in each voxel. Each subject-specific image was then spatially smoothed with the toolbox-recommended Gaussian kernel of 10 mm FWHM. \n\n\n### Overlap of sample entropy and ICC results \n  \nTo identify the spatial overlaps between maps of statistical differences in ICC or SampEn values in DOC and anaesthesia, the fslmaths functions from FMRIB Software Library (FSL;  ) was used to binarise the thresholded significance maps. For each dataset (anaesthesia and DOC), the binarised ICC and entropy masks were then superimposed on each other, to find regions that showed reductions in both entropy and integration. Thus, one mask of ICC-entropy overlap was obtained for each dataset. Finally, to identify whether the same regions showed common reductions of entropy and integration in both DOC and anaesthesia, the two dataset-specific masks of ICC-entropy overlap were themselves superimposed to find their overlap. The result was a single brain mask, showing those brain regions that significantly reduced both their temporal entropy and their global connectivity between conscious and unconscious conditions, both in the propofol and the DOC datasets. \n\n\n### Connectivity matrix construction \n  \nTo construct matrices of functional connectivity, normalised brains were parcellated into 90 cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs) derived from the automated anatomical labelling (AAL) atlas, covering the entire brain excluding Cerebellum and Vermis . \n\nEach ROI was also assigned to one of 7 well-characterised resting-state networks (RSNs), derived from resting-state intrinsic connectivity analysis of 1000 healthy individuals : default mode network (DMN), somatomotor (SOM), visual (VIS), salience/ventral attention network (SAL), dorsal attention network (DAN), fronto-parietal network (FPN), and limbic plus subcortical regions (LIM). \n\nThe timecourses of denoised BOLD signals were averaged between all voxels belonging to a given AAL-derived ROI, using the CONN toolbox. The resulting region-specific timecourses of each subject were then extracted for further analysis in MATLAB version 2016a. Functional connectivity was estimated as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the timecourses of each pair of ROIs, over the full scanning length. \n\n\n### Dynamic functional connectivity \n  \nDynamic connectivity matrices were derived using an overlapping sliding-window approach . For each subject and each condition, tapered sliding windows were obtained by convolving a rectangle of 22 TRs (44s) with a Gaussian kernel of 3 TRs, sliding with 1 TR step size. This resulted in 229 windows/timepoints per condition for the awake and anaesthetised subjects, and 273 windows for the DOC patients. \n\nWithin each of the resulting overlapping temporal windows of 22 TRs, a 90-by-90 matrix of functional connectivity was estimated, with the connection between each pair of AAL-derived ROIs being given by the Pearson correlation between their timecourses within that window. \n\n\n### Derivation of integrated and segregated states \n  \nStates of higher integration or segregation were identified from the patterns of connectivity between regions, by establishing a “cartographic profile”  based on the module assignments of each ROI, considered as a network node. Firstly, within each time-resolved functional connectivity matrix (weighted and signed), the asymmetric algorithm of Rubinov and Sporns  implemented in the MATLAB-based Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT;  )  was used to identify network modules by applying the Louvain greedy algorithm , which iteratively evaluates different ways of assigning nodes to modules, in order to maximise the resulting modularity function   Q:  where   υ   is the total weight of the graph (sum of all edges),   w   is the (signed) weight of the edge between nodes   i   and   j  ,   e   is the weight of an edge divided by the total weight of the graph (positive and negative edges are denoted with ‘ + ’ and ‘−’ superscripts, respectively), and   δ   is set to 1 when nodes   i   and   j   are in the same module and 0 otherwise. \n\nIn the case of signed graphs, a module is defined as a group of nodes that are positively correlated with each other, but negatively correlated with nodes belonging to different modules . Due to its stochastic nature, the algorithm was repeated for 100 iterations for each time-resolved network, and the module size resolution parameter   γ   was set to one, the default . \n\nBased on the modularity assignments identified in the previous step, we then derived the participation coefficient and within-degree Z-score for each node. The participation coefficient   quantifies the degree of connection that a node entertains with nodes belonging to other modules: the more of a node’s connections are towards other modules, the higher its participation coefficient will be ref.  . Conversely, the participation coefficient of a node will be zero if its connections \n\nare all with nodes belonging to its own module. Here,   κ   is the strength of positive connections between node   i   and other nodes in module   s  ,   k   is the strength of all its positive connections, and   M   is the number of modules in the network, as identified by a given modularity detection algorithm. The participation coefficient ranges between zero (no connections with other modules) and one (equal connections to all other modules). A network with high average participation coefficient can be expected to have high levels of integration between its constituent modules. \n\nConversely, the within-module degree Z-score   Z   is a measure of a node’s connectivity with other nodes belonging to its module. It indicates how much larger (or smaller) the node’s connections to other nodes in the module are, relative to the average connection strength within that module. A node with high within-module degree Z-score has stronger-than-average coupling with the other nodes in its module . where   κ   is the strength of connections between node   i   and other nodes in module   s  , and   and   σ   are respectively the average and the standard deviation of   κ   over all nodes belonging to module   s  . The Brain Connectivity Toolbox was used to derive both the participation coefficient and within-degree Z-score for each node. \n\nSubsequently, joint histograms of participation coefficient and within-module Z-score were produced for each timepoint (using MATLAB code made freely available by Shine et al. at  ) , since together, these two measures quantify both a node’s inter- modular and intra-modular connectivity. For each subject, the joint patterns were then used to assign each timepoint to one of two clusters, using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm known as k-means clustering (setting   k   = 2) . To avoid the possibility of the algorithm becoming stuck in local minima, it was repeated 500 times with random re-initialisation of the two clusters’ initial points. This was performed individually for each subject and condition. Following Shine et al. , Pearson correlation was chosen as distance metric for the algorithm. \n\nFinally, the cluster with higher mean participation coefficient was labelled as the integrated state, while the cluster with lower average participation coefficient was considered to be the segregated state . For each subject, a centroid matrix of functional connectivity was computed for each state, as the element-wise median of the timepoint-specific FC matrices assigned to the cluster corresponding to that state. The proportion of time spent in each state was also estimated, as the number of timepoints assigned to that cluster, over the total number of timepoints. \n\n\n### Dynamic state connectivity analysis \n  \nOnce an integrated and a segregated state centroids had been derived for each subject and condition, we investigated how the pattern of connectivity in each state varied between the conscious and unconscious conditions. Since this work focuses on the common aspects of unconsciousness induced by different means, we sought to identify which connections were significantly affected in the same way in both datasets. This involved a two-step analysis. First, for each state (integrated, segregated) the corresponding centroid matrices were compared between Awake and Deep conditions, and between conscious controls and DOC patients. Thus, a matrix of mean differences was computed for each state in each dataset, so that the edge   W   represented the mean difference across conditions in the strength of the connection between regions   i   and   j  . Subsequently, the matrices were significance-thresholded by setting to 0 any edge that did not reach a significance level of   α     <   0.05 (FDR-corrected for multiple comparisons), as assessed by   t  -tests (paired for the propofol dataset, independent-samples for the DOC dataset). The resulting matrices of significant edges were then combined across datasets, to construct a matrix of common unconsciousness-induced connectivity differences. In this matrix, if both significance-thresholded matrices had a positive edge at position   i,j  , edge   w   was set to the minimum value of the two; if both thresholded matrices had negative values at   i,j  , edge   w   was instead set to the maximum of the two (i.e. smaller absolute value); and   w   was set to 0 in all other cases. The presence of a non-zero edge in the resulting matrix therefore indicates that the corresponding regions   i   and   j   show consistent changes in their functional connectivity as a result of unconsciousness, regardless of how it was induced—with the direction of the alteration being given by the sign of   w  , and its weight representing the minimum extent of such alteration. After performing this analysis for the integrated and segregated state, the same analysis was also performed on the static FC matrices. This revealed whether any of the patterns of change observed in the static FC were specifically due to changes in the segregated or the integrated state. \n\n\n### Brain graph construction \n  \nIn graph theory, a graph   G   = (  N,K  ), is a mathematical representation of a network of   N   nodes (or vertices, typically represented as points) connected by   K   edges (or links, typically represented as lines between pairs of points). Here, subject- and condition-specific brain graphs were constructed by thresholding the corresponding functional connectivity matrices (see above), so that nodes were given by AAL-derived brain regions, and edges were given by their functional connectivity. We thresholded each FC matrix proportionally, at density levels ranging between 10 and 25%, sampled in steps of 5%. To ensure robustness of the result, graph-theoretical metrics were averaged across thresholds for each subject and session before analysis. \n\nSince edge weight can be expected to carry biological meaning as the strength of communication between different regions, we chose not to binarise the graphs. In line with similar work , we used weighted graphs for the analyses presented here, made possible by the availability of algorithms for weighted graph analysis . \n\nTo ensure that our results could not be attributed to our choice of node and edge estimation, we ran the same graph-theoretical analyses (for static FC, integrated state and segregated state, in both anaesthetised individuals and DOC patients) with different parameter choices: for edges, we applied higher density levels (30 to 50%, in 10% steps) and binarised rather than weighted edges; for nodes, we used the 234 ROIs of the Lausanne scale 125 template ) (Supplementary Figs.  – ). \n\n\n### Graph metrics \n  \nThe graph-theoretical properties used in this work are described below, based on the definitions provided by Rubinov and Sporns . Each measure was computed for the static, integrated and segregated functional connectivity matrix of each subject, for each scanning session. All graph-theoretical measures were computed using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox . \n\nCharacteristic path length (  L  ) is a network-wide measure of how effortful it is on average to move between different nodes in the network. This metric is calculated as the average length of the shortest path   d   between every pair of nodes in the network. \n\nThe characteristic path length is understood as inversely related to the ability to integrate information across the whole network . \n\nThe clustering coefficient of node   i   (  C  ) is a node-specific measure of how well connected a node’s neighbourhood is; in a binarized graph, it is calculated as the fraction of neighbours of the node that are also neighbours of each other. where   t   is the number of triangles around node   i  , (for binarized graphs) or the geometric mean of triangles around node   i   (for weighted graphs). The mean of all nodes’ clustering coefficients (i.e. the network’s mean clustering coefficient) indicates how well connected, on average, the neighbourhoods present in the network tend to be. When applied to brain networks, the clustering coefficient is thought to represent the degree of information integration at a local level, and hence the potential for efficiently performing specialised, segregated local processing . \n\nBoth the characteristic path length and mean clustering coefficient are typically provided as normalised, i.e. divided by the corresponding metric of a random graph with the same number of nodes and edges, and preserved degree distribution . Here, we used the average of the same measures computed for 100 random graphs, each constructed by randomly rewiring each edge in the original graph 100 times. \n\nSmall-worldness: a network is considered to be small-world if it has both the high mean clustering coefficient typical of regular lattice networks, but also the small characteristic path length typical of random networks . Small-worldness represents the balance between integration/global processing (low characteristic path length) and segregation/local processing (high mean clustering coefficient), and is summarised by   S  , the ratio of the graph’s normalised mean clustering coefficient to normalised characteristic path length .. \n\n\n### Connectivity entropy \n  \nComplexity of a given state of functional connectivity was estimated by the mean normalised Shannon entropy of the connections of each ROI. Following the procedure of Saenger et al. , the connectivity values in each column of the matrix were assigned into   n   bins to construct a distribution, and a normalised version of the Shannon entropy of this distribution was computed for each node according to the following equation : \n\nTo constrain the entropy values between 0 and 1 , the original Shannon entropy was normalised by the Shannon entropy of a uniform distribution, which corresponds to log(  n  ). Here, we followed Saenger and colleagues , always using   n     =   10 bins. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe statistical significance of within-group differences between the awake and deep anaesthetised conditions was determined with non-parametric permutation   t  -tests (repeated-measures), with 10,000 permutations. Permutation- based two-samples t-tests with 10,000 permutations were instead used to assess group differences between the awake condition of the propofol dataset (used as healthy control group) and the DOC patients, and between the TBI and HBI subgroups of DOC patients. All tests were two-sided. For measures that showed a significant difference, the effect size was also estimated using Hedge’s   g  . \n\nWhen subnetwork-specific analyses were performed, the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure  was adopted to control the false discovery rate across multiple comparisons, at a corrected   α   level of 0.05. This procedure was also applied for the analysis of FC matrix differences. \n\nFor the statistical analyses performed on brain maps (ICC and SampEn), group-level comparisons were implemented as a GLM, using parametric paired t-tests for the differences between awake and deep anaesthesia conditions, and unpaired   t  -tests for the differences between DOC patients and controls. All tests were two-sided. The resulting output maps of group differences were thresholded at voxelwise   p     <   0.001 (uncorrected), and corrected for multiple comparisons by applying a family-wise error (FWE) cluster-based correction, resulting in   p     <   0.05. These steps were performed within the SPM12-based CONN toolbox for the ICC analysis, and directly in SPM12 for the SampEn analysis. \n\n\n### Reporting summary \n  \nFurther information on research design is available in the   linked to this article. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"9c1e7d5292612462378f44ec781a2fa2"},

For example, alterations in the default mode network (DMN) and thalamus were detected in childhood absence epilepsy ( ); The thalamus was shown to be impacted in patients suffering from generalized temporal lobe epilepsy ( ), while the basal ganglia was strongly implicated in frontal lobe epilepsy ( ,  ). For patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) functional connectivity disturbances in both the thalamo-motor and thalamo-frontal networks were found ( ;  ). Resting-state functional MRI may even be useful for identifying subjects at increased risk to develop epilepsy ( ). Most of the previous Resting-state functional MRI studies of epilepsy patients have assessed the static functional connectivity, which refers to the functionally integrated relationship between spatially separated brain regions in the entire time period of Resting-state functional MRI data sampling session ( ). Static functional connectivity is usually derived from the entire Resting-state functional MRI time courses in forms of temporal correlation of the signal intensities between different brain regions. However, more deliberate studies have recently demonstrated that the resting-state functional networks (RFNs) of the brain fluctuate on the scale of seconds to minutes ( ,  ). The concept of dynamic functional connectivity is, therefore, an important aspect of the resting-state functional activities, which considers functional connectivity variations over a short period of time. \n\nDynamic functional connectivity has now been investigated in a variety of contexts related to both behavior and neural activity ( ,  ), which has deepened our understanding of the functional networks in the brain. Numerous studies have shown reproducible patterns of short-term network activity that move throughout the brain ( ,  ). Such transition of brain states has been confirmed in both animal models and humans ( ). Dynamic functional connectivity analysis has shown that the spontaneous transitions between networks of interacting brain areas are highly organized into a hierarchy of two types of metastates: one for higher order cognition, and the other for the sensorimotor systems ( ). The transitions are more probable within, than between, metastates. Furthermore, the time spent in each metastate is individual specific and associated with behavior ( ). There is also emerging evidence to indicate that dynamic functional connectivity is affected by a variety of factors, such as mental states ( ), sleep ( ), learning ( ), and neuropathologies ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). There has been a rapidly growing interest in utilizing dynamic functional connectivity to study neuropsychiatric disorders where time-varying abnormalities have been reported in different neuropsychiatric diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's diseases. Most of the findings are related to the disruption of some specific function networks and the transition patterns among different metastates. For example, it has been reported that schizophrenia patients have less frequent changes between the implicated RFNs than healthy subjects ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). A few studies have recently reported hyper dynamic activities in some specific RFNs for different sub-types of epilepsy disorders. For example, abnormal dynamic functional connectivity were detected for temporal lobe epilepsy in hippocampi ( ), temporal pole ( ), posterior cingulate cortex ( ), and inter-regional connectivity within DMN ( ). Aberrant functional connectivity dynamics in DMN was also observed for idiopathic generalized epilepsy with generalized tonic–clonic seizures ( ). \n\nAs discussed above, the association between the disrupted functional networks and specific neuropathological behaviors for some sub-types of epilepsy disorders has been the focus of many neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies. Such network notion has seminally improved our understanding and characterization of epilepsy. However, to the best of our knowledge, dynamic functional connectivity has not been assessed in JME patients. The focus of the present study is to assess both static and dynamic functional connectivity characteristics of JME subjects in a quantitative data-driven fashion. As the most common idiopathic generalized epilepsy disorder, many issues remain not fully understood in JME. Previous studies have provided multiple lines of evidence to support the hypothesis that JME is a multi-regional thalamocortical ‘network’ epilepsy form ( ;  ), rather than a generalized epilepsy disorder. Furthermore, stationary connectomic correlates with cognitive impairment have been found in the thalamo-motor and thalamo-frontal systems ( ;  ;  ;  ). However, it remains largely unclear whether deficiency is present in the dynamic interactions between RFNs or between brain areas within a given RFN. In this study, we incorporated sliding window analysis of time-varying connectivity hierarchy (SWATCH) into previously developed quantitative data-driven analysis framework ( ;  ) to assess functional connectivity both in the entire data acquisition period (assumed stationary) and a 2-min sliding window in a voxel-wise fashion. With the SWATCH analysis, we can derive two types of functional connectivity metrics, namely the functional connectivity strength index (CSI) and connectivity count index (CCI) as well as the temporal means of their sliding-window time series from the acquired resting-state fMRI data. By comparing to the data form the demographically matched healthy controls with voxel-wise   t  -test, we aimed to address the following questions: 1) Is there any JME specific static abnormality in terms of CCI and CSI? 2) Is there any JME specific dynamic functional connectivity abnormality in the terms of the temporal means of CSI and CCI? 3) Is there any spatial overlap between the detected static and dynamic functional connectivity abnormalities? Clarification of these issues may increase the amount of diagnostic information that can be obtained from Resting-state functional MRI measurements in JME. Furthermore, it can improve our understanding of the brain functioning mechanisms in JME regarding to their cognitive impairment. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Data acquisition \n  \nThe Central Ethical Review Board for Stockholm region approved the ethical permission for the Resting-state functional MRI study. For this study, we recruited a total of 25 normal adult subjects (male/female = 14/10, age = 33.2 ± 13.5), and clinically diagnosed JME patients. All recruited patients are long-term consecutive patients at Karolinska University Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden). They were controlled at this hospital from the year of their seizure onset and were well known to the neurologists in charge. Only patients whose seizure phenomenology was reliably assessed with the aid of close relatives were included in the study. All patients were also investigated with high resolution MRI according to the epilepsy protocol, and those with abnormal structural findings were excluded from the study. The diagnosis of JME was based on seizure history, seizure semiology as described by relatives or recorded during hospitalization, and scalp EEG recordings. Eighteen patients (3 males and 15 females, mean age 30.11 ± 7.73 years, range 20–48 years) were diagnosed with JME. They had late childhood-or-teenage onset of awakening myoclonic jerks, often in the upper, but sometimes also in the lower extremities. All of them had history of myoclonies as well as Generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Four of them also experienced rare absences. None of the patients had a progressive condition. The inclusion criterion in education was 11 years in school, of which at least 2 years in non-mandatory education (equivalent to high-school and above). The included patients had on average 12.7 ± 1.7 years in school, and their intelligence was accessed to be not impacted by the disorder to the degree such that mandatory education in Sweden cannot be completed. The demographic, symptomatic, and medical history data are detailed in Supporting Information A. \n\nAll MRI scans were conducted using a 3 T whole-body clinical MRI scanner (TIM Trio, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). A single-shot 2D gradient-recalled echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence was used to acquire the Resting-state functional MRI data with the following essential acquisition parameters: 32 transverse slices (3.6 mm thickness), TR/TE = 2000/35 ms, FOV = 220 mm, matrix size = 64 × 64, flip angle = 90°, 300 dynamic time-frames, IPAT = 2. A 32-channel phased-array head coil was used for the signal reception. Foam paddings were used for every subject to reduce the head motions. During the Resting-state functional MRI scans the participants were instructed to close their eyes but not fall asleep, they were also instructed to not think about anything specific during the Resting-state functional MRI scans. \n\n\n### Resting-state functional MRI data preprocessing \n  \nAll Resting-state functional MRI datasets underwent the same preprocessing procedure, which was performed with AFNI ( ) and FSL ( ) programs with a bash wrapper shell. The first 5 time-frames in each dataset were removed to ensure signal steady state. After de-spiking, six-parameter rigid body image registration was performed for motion correction. The average volume for each motion-corrected time series was used to generate a brain mask to minimize the inclusion of the extra-cerebral tissue. Spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard-space T1-weighted average structural template image was performed using a 12-parameter affine transformation and mutual-information cost function. During the affine transformation, the imaging data were also re-sampled to isotropic resolution using a Gaussian kernel with 4 mm Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) as dictated by the largest voxel dimension. Nuisance signal removal was performed by voxel-wise regression using the 6 motion correction parameters, average signal of the ventricles and their respective 1st order derivatives, totaling on 14 regressors. After removing baseline trend up to the third order polynomial, effective band-pass filtering was performed using low-pass filtering at 0.08 Hz. Local Gaussian smoothing up to FWHM = 5 mm was performed using an eroded gray matter mask. \n\n\n### Static functional connectivity with quantitative data-driven analysis \n  \nFor each subject, the Pearson's cross-correlation coefficients of the resting-state functional MRI time courses were computed for voxel-pairs inside a brain mask, generating a N × N (where N is the number of voxels within the brain mask) correlation coefficient matrix. For data reduction, the following functional connectivity index maps were calculated from the huge correlation coefficient map for each subject: 1) Connection Strength Index (CSI) which is defined as the non-zero mean value of the Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) ≥ 0.3 for all voxel pairs involving the current voxel in question. 2) Connection Count Index (CCI) which is the number of voxel pairs involving the current voxel in question with the absolute CC ≥ 0.3. \n\n\n### Dynamic functional connectivity with SWATCH analysis \n  \nTo characterize the time variations of the CCI and CSI maps we incorporated a 2 min sliding window into the quantitative data-driven analysis procedure. We computed CCI and CSI maps for every 2 min window (60 time-frames). The increment between the adjacent sliding windows was one frame, therefore, we obtained a time series of CCI and CSI maps with 235 time-frames for each Resting-state functional MRI dataset. Then, we computed the voxel-wise temporal averages of the 2-min sliding window CCI and CSI time series for each Resting-state functional MRI dataset for further statistical analysis. The pipeline of the SWATCH analysis for 10-min acquisition with a 2-min sliding window is schematically outlined in  .   \nSchematic illustration of the quantitative data analysis (top row) and SWATCH (bottom row) pipelines. With quantitative data-driven analysis the entire time course of the resting-state functional MRI data is used to compute the CC matrix for all voxels within the brain. The CC matrix size is typically in the order of 15 × 103 for Resting-state functional MRI data with 4 mm spatial resolution. For data reduction in quantitative data-driven analysis, we compute the number of correlated voxel-pairs and their average CC values ≥0.3. The threshold was selected based on the empirical assessment of the statistical sensitivity of the derived metrics ( ). With SWATCH, a 2-min window of the time course was used to compute the CC matrix. While the 2-min window sliding along the time course, a time series of CC matrixes were obtained, from which a time series of metrics can be derived as in quantitative data-driven analysis. The dynamic aspects of the time series of metrics can be evaluated using temporal statistics, such as the temporal means of the time series. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nDifferences in motion during data acquisition between the two groups were accessed by extracting the maximum of each parameter in the transformation matrix across time for each subject and compared between healthy control and JME patients. \n\nTo test the possible differences in functional connectivity between JME patients and the healthy controls, we performed un-paired, Welch's 2-way   t  -test of the CCI and CSI data for the entire time course and the temporal averages, <CCI> and < CSI>, corresponding to their respective 2-min sliding window series using the AFNI program   3dttest++  . Age and sex of the individual subjects were included as confounders in the statistical tests. The statistical significance of the   t  -tests was assessed first by setting an uncorrected voxel-wise threshold at   p   < .01 and then imposing a minimum voxel cluster size of at least 20 contiguous voxels. The probability of random field of noise producing a cluster of size ≥ 20 was estimated at family-wise error rate (FWER)   p   < .05. This was concluded from the Monte-Carlo simulation result obtained by using the AFNI program,   AlphaSim+  . The simulations we used following essential input parameters: matrix size = 45 × 45 × 54, a gray matter mask based on MNI template, voxel-wise threshold value   p   < .01, 10  iterations, and FWHM = 5.8 mm, which was the estimated average by applying the AFNI program, 3dFWHMx, to the CSI and CCI image data, which was quite close to FWHM = 5 mm used in the final imaging smoothing procedure described above. On top of the cluster simulation results, any resulting clusters are further filtered with the ETAC (Equitable Thresholding and Clustering) approach, ensuring global false positive rates (FPR) of <5% through (equitable) multiple thresholding of randomization/permutation technique ( ). Due to the cluster size filtering was performed prior to ETAC, the resulting clusters may be smaller than 20 voxels in size. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nNone of the transformation parameters showed significant differences between JME patients and healthy controls (  p   > .12), indicating that JME patients did not move more than the healthy control subjects during acquisition. The confounders did not result in any regions of significance (  p   < .01) that survived our thresholding scheme (global FPR < 5%), and hence not shown. However, it should be noted that the confounders, especially age, showed regions of significance (p < .01) without cluster thresholding. \n\nA shows a typical set of static and dynamic functional connectivity images for a JME patient participated in the study, as computed from the resting-state functional MRI measurements with the SWATCH analysis method described above. There is an overall consistency in tissue contrast among the different connectivity metrics. The brain regions with high functional connection density and strength both in the entire data acquisition period and 2-min sliding window include the anterior and posterior cingulate, precuneus, insula, visual and sensory motor cortices, which have been previously identified as the major functional connectivity hubs. The contrast differences between the connection density metrics (CCI and <CCI>) and the connection strength metrics (CSI and <CSI>) are also quite noticeable. This can be better appreciated by the corresponding histograms shown in  B. The contrast differences can also be seen on density plots of the static and dynamic metrics averaged across all subjects ( ).   \nA: Cross-sectional display of the static and dynamic functional connectivity metrics for a JME patient participated in the study.

As detailed in  , both CCI and CSI are significantly (Global FPR < 5%) higher for the JME patients in multiple brain regions. The involved brain areas are mainly in the left hemisphere, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, precentral and middle temporal gyri. Compared with the normal controls, the ROI averages of the CSI and CCI metrics for the JME patients were about 3.2 and 52% higher, respectively (see  ,  B and  B).   \n(A) Brain regions with statistical significant difference (Global FPR <5%) in CCI between healthy controls and JME patients; (B) Boxplots of the average CCI values for the individual subjects in the brain regions of interests depicted in (A).

The brain region with significant CSI difference was about 4 times of that for CCI (see  , 79 voxels versus 20 voxels). There were no overlapping voxels between the CCI and CSI results. \n\nThe <CCI> and <CSI> data from the 2-min sliding window revealed also multiple brain regions with significant (Global FPR < 5%) differences in dynamic functional connectivity metrics between the JME patients and healthy controls.  ,   depict the   t  -test results of the <CCI> and <CSI> data, respectively.

Comparing to the results for healthy controls, the time courses showed that JME patients have not only higher average values over the entire time period (i.e. higher <CCI> and <CSI>), but also higher level of variations as indicated by the standard deviations of the time series. The ROI averages of <CSI> and <CCI> for the JME patients were about 3.3 and 14% higher than those for the normal controls (see  ,  C and  C, respectively). \n\n depicts the overlapping brain areas between the static and dynamic functional connectivity results. As detailed in  , there were only 16 overlapping voxels between the CCI and <CCI> results, whereas there none for CSI and <CSI>. As detailed in  , in this overlapping brain region, all the static and dynamic functional connectivity metrics were systematically higher for JME patients compared with healthy controls.   \nOverlapping brain regions between static CCI results shown in   and dynamic <CCI> results shown in  . \n  Fig. 8   \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we incorporated a 2-min sliding-window into the previously developed quantitative data-driven analysis framework to investigate the static and dynamic functional connectivity abnormalities in JME patients. The key findings of the study are the followings:   \nThe static metrics, CCI and CSI, based on quantitative data analysis of the entire 10-min acquisition window of the Resting-state functional MRI data revealed significant higher static functional connectivity in JME patients compared with healthy controls in dorsal striatum and middle frontal gyri. \n  \nThe dynamic metrics, <CCI> and <CSI> derived from 2-min SWATCH analysis, demonstrated also significant hyper functional connectivity dynamics dominant in the left hemisphere in multiple brain regions including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle temporal gyrus and dorsal striatum. \n  \nThe brain regions with abnormal functional connectivity density (CCI and <CCI>) are much smaller (one-half to a quarter) than those with hyper functional connection strength (CSI and <CSI>). Large portions of the abnormal functional connectivity density overlaps between the static and dynamic metrics, while the functional connectivity strength regions that show hyper-connectivity in JME patients do not overlap at all. \n  \n\n### The quantitative data-driven analysis and SWATCH analysis methods \n  \nThe quantitative data-driven analysis method has the following characteristics: It does not require prior parcellation of the Resting-state functional MRI data into anatomical regions, either using anatomical atlases or spatial independent component analysis (ICA). It is data-driven and hence does not require user input. For each dataset, quantitative data-driven analysis generates functional connectivity metrics based on voxel-wise Person's correlation coefficients, which can facilitate direct statistical comparison between subject groups. To capture the abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity for the JME patients, we extended our existing framework to incorporate a 2-min sliding window and evaluated the temporal average of the time-varying functional connectivity metrics. \n\nDifferent approaches have been used to study the temporal variations of the resting-state brain functional connectivity, ranging from sorting of resting-state functional MRI data into distinct co-activation patterns ( ) to more sophisticated temporal ICA on top of spatial ICA ( ). Time-frequency decomposition using the wavelet transform ( ) has also been successfully applied to investigate the temporal variations of the RFNs ( ). The sliding-window approach is intuitive and commonly used ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). It can be readily incorporated with well-established analysis methods for resting-state functional MRI data, such as, ICA ( ;  ;  ) and ROI seed methods ( ;  ). \n\nThe sliding-window approach was also opted here to assess the dynamic characteristics of RFNs, as it is straightforward to be combined with our previously developed quantitative data-driven analysis framework ( ;  ). However, there are a number of known issues with sliding-window approaches ( ;  ), particularly regarding to the window size. Empirical evidence from previous studies suggests that 1-min window size is sufficiently robust to detect functional connectivity networks corresponding to distinct cognitive states ( ) and brain network topology ( ) in typical fMRI scans. The loss of signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) becomes an issue of concern for shorter window sizes, as there are fewer time points available in each window and the higher frequencies will be increasingly dominate. Overall this will increase the variability in the sliding-window metrics independent of neuronal activity. If the sliding window and sliding step are large, the temporal resolution will be too low. After a systematic testing with different window sizes (detailed in Supplementary Information B), we choose to use a 2-min window size and the minimum sliding increment of 1 timeframe for the present study to achieve sufficient SNR for the dynamic functional connectivity metrics without losing temporal resolution. \n\nStatic metrics provide an ‘average’ picture of brain network dynamics. By quantifying dynamic metrics, we obtain a view of the brain's dynamic interactions (Hutchison et al., 2013). This is especially useful when studying JME subjects with paroxysmal characteristics. We used the temporal averages, <CCI> and <CSI>, to assess the dynamic characteristics of their corresponding sliding-window time series for CCI and CSI. However, they are still rudimentary measures and do not fully capture the nature of temporal dynamics. We conducted extensive testing of different measures that can assess the temporal dynamics of a sliding window time series, including standard deviation, variance, and entropy. The temporal averages were opted as the measure of choice in this study because they are robust with sufficient SNR and sensitive to detect the dynamic functional connectivity differences between JME patients and normal volunteers. \n\nLarger clusters formed through dynamic compared to static functional connectivity may be attributed to the overall larger values in the dynamic metrics as compared to the static, but more likely due to slight differences in the distribution of values, where there is a larger portion of large values for dynamic metrics as compared to the static as seen in  . However, there is no overlap between the static and dynamic connectivity strength indices, suggesting that while our dynamic approach may reveal additional information, it cannot be solely to replace the static. Multi-length sliding-window approaches are currently being investigated to capture the slower variations in dynamic functional connectivity. \n\n\n### Neuropathological characteristics of JME \n  \nSince its initial identification in 1957, JME has now been widely recognized as a common epilepsy form with brain function network abnormality via a variety of underlying causes ( ;  ). Typical clinical characteristics of JME include the following: 1) Myoclonic jerks of the upper limbs, tonic-clonic seizures and infrequent absence seizures; 2) a lack of apparent structural pathology in MRI and computer tomography; 3) close association with cognitive and emotion deficiency indicative of frontal lobe dysfunctions. Identifying the precise JME specific abnormalities in brain functional networks has been considered as the key for understanding neural mechanisms underlying the cognitive impairments. Neuroimaging studies in last two decades have provided several lines of evidence suggesting that JME is characterized by common brain functional network abnormalities despite the heterogeneous nature of this patient group. For example, positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrated metabolic and neurotransmitter changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and midbrain structures reflecting the particular cognitive and behavioral profile of JME patients ( ;  ;  ). 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H -MRS) has shown evidence of progressive frontal and thalamic dysfunction ( ;  ). BOLD fMRI studies have also shown that JME patients have aberrant functional integration between the motor and frontal networks ( ). More recent resting-state functional MRI studies have further shown that JME patients depict hyper synchronized RFNs in multiple brain regions involving mainly the thalamo-prefrontocortical networks ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Hyper dynamic functional connectivity in JME \n  \nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate abnormalities in dynamics of RFNs in a group of JME patients. Several studies have previously shown similar behavior for TLE ( ;  ;  ;  ). Taken together with the literature results from static functional connectivity studies, our finding provides further evidence for ‘common’ fronto-cortical-subcortical network abnormalities among subjects with clinically and genetically heterogeneous JME. This is also supported by the results from neuropsychological studies ( ;  ), which revealed cognitive deficits in patients with JME, mainly implicating the thalamo-frontocortical network dysfunction. \n\n\n\n## Limitations of the study \n  \nIt remains important to test the overall specificity of the brain network changes we have observed in this cohort of JME subjects. Recent dynamic functional connectivity studies of TLE patients have reported the engagement of similar but not identical networks ( ;  ;  ). However, this appears not valid for the generalized epilepsies. A limitation of this study is that we were not able to account for functional brain changes potentially caused by anti-epileptic drug use ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). However, it is unlikely that our results can be accounted for by anti-epileptic drug effect at group level considering the different types of drugs and years of treatment (see Supporting Information A). \n\nSince the current sample of JME patients did not perform MRI scans during seizure, it is unlikely that our findings indicate network properties that are directly involved in instigation or propagation of seizures. \n\nTo better characterize the brain regions displaying abnormal functional connectivity between JME patients and healthy controls. Whether the hyperactive brain regions have a specific target in their hyperactive states in the form of specific functional connectivity network, or another brain region, is not characterized in this study. Neither EEG, nor PET/SPECT data were acquired as a part of this study. Hence it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions concerning the exact nature of any abnormalities detected in static, or dynamic, functional connectivity from the resting-state fMRI data presented here since we cannot confirm any potential hypothesis for their underlying mechanisms. Also, without complementary imaging modalities, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that the brain regions shown to be abnormal in functional connectivity in our analysis are not false positives. We have attempted to confirm the validity of each resulting cluster with published literature and have found that all brain regions found to be abnormal between JME patients and healthy controls in this study support existing literature on the disease. While this does not constitute as definitive proof that our results are not, at least in part, contaminated by false positives, it does give indication that our analysis methods show promise in detecting true functional connectivity abnormalities. \n\nThe presented clusters in in this study undergone filtering through both cluster simulation and ETAC thresholding, which is somewhat redundant and overly zealous to guarantee global false positive rates <5%, we are currently looking into alternative analysis methods in conjunction with cluster enhancement methods ( ) to control global false positive rates in a more consistent fashion. This is especially impactful when the results as presented here consists mostly of small focal areas, of which some are sub-cortical. Our acquisition method is optimized for detecting abnormalities in large cortical regions foremostly, and due to the spatial resolution, not suited for spatially defining focal regions. By strict control of global false positive rates in the statistical analysis, we sacrifice spatial definition for robustness. Further studies, hopefully in conjunction with other modalities such as EEG and PET/SPECT, should be undertaken with higher spatial resolution to more clearly define structure, and substructure, boundaries. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, neuroimaging studies have provided multiple lines of evidence to support the notion that JME is a frontal lobe variant of a multi-regional, thalamocortical ‘network’ epilepsy form, rather than a generalized epilepsy syndrome. Incorporating a 2-min sliding window approach into quantitative data-driven analysis of resting-state functional MRI data can reveal additional information on the temporally fluctuating functional connectivity networks of the human brain, which indicate that RFNs involving dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have unique hyper dynamic characteristics in JME patients. Accessing the static along with the dynamic functional connectivity analysis may provide additional information for temporally transients diseases such as epilepsy, providing further insights into the abnormalities in functional connectivity underlying the cognitive deficiency in JME. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"62aa7e8a05d8295c5c9396406868e7ee"},

Correlations in these signals, known as functional connectivity, can be averaged over several minutes of data to provide a stable representation of the functional network architecture for an individual. However, associations between these stable features and behavioural traits have been shown to be dominated by individual differences in anatomy. Here, using kernel learning tools, we propose methods to assess and compare the relation between time-varying functional connectivity, time-averaged functional connectivity, structural brain data, and non-imaging subject behavioural traits. We applied these methods to Human Connectome Project resting-state fMRI data to show that time-varying fMRI functional connectivity, detected at time-scales of a few seconds, has associations with some behavioural traits that are not dominated by anatomy. Despite time-averaged functional connectivity accounting for the largest proportion of variability in the fMRI signal between individuals, we found that some aspects of intelligence could only be explained by time-varying functional connectivity. The finding that time-varying fMRI functional connectivity has a unique relationship to population behavioural variability suggests that it might reflect transient neuronal communication fluctuating around a stable neural architecture. \n \n\n# Body\n \n   Significance statement   \nComplex cognition is dynamic and emerges from the interaction between multiple areas across the whole brain, i.e. from brain networks. Hence, the utility of functional MRI to investigate brain activity depends on how well it can capture time-varying network interactions. Here, we develop methods to predict behavioural traits of individuals from either time-varying functional connectivity, time-averaged functional connectivity, or structural brain data. We use these to show that the time-varying nature of functional brain networks in fMRI can be reliably measured and can explain aspects of behaviour not captured by structural data or time-averaged functional connectivity. These results provide important insights to the question of how the brain represents information and how these representations can be measured with fMRI. \n \n\n## Introduction \n  \nThe emergence of large-scale distributed networks in spontaneous brain activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a widely-studied phenomenon ( ;  ). These networks have been consistently identified using cross-regional temporal correlations – referred to as functional connectivity (FC) ( ;  ;  ). Typically, FC is estimated by averaging over several minutes of data (e.g. across a scanning session, for each pair of regions) to provide a stable representation of the functional network architecture for an individual ( ). This   time-averaged FC   has previously been associated with mental performance ( ;  ) and, more generally, to widespread behavioural phenotypes ( ). However, there is evidence that some of these associations are to a large extent driven by structural differences between subjects ( ;  ). We hypothesised that, while time-averaged FC might to some extent be dominated by structural information, the temporal deviations of FC might be less so, and could thereby have a distinct relationship with behaviour. This would provide evidence that time-varying FC from fMRI can reflect momentary neuronal communication fluctuating around a stable functional architecture, and might be related to dynamic elements of cognition such as attention and thinking ( ;  ). \n\nWhile there is clear evidence that electrophysiologically-derived FC relates to momentary mental states ( ;  ;  ;  ), whether dynamic changes in fMRI-derived FC reflect distinct and transient patterns of communication between neuronal populations is still controversial ( ). In the absence of stimuli, measures of ongoing behavioural outputs or any ground truth, discerning whether time-varying FC carries biological meaning in the resting state is indeed not straightforward ( ;  ). One possibility is to use indirect behavioural correlates, for example, by assessing the extent to which FC prior to task onset influences task performance ( ), quantifying how the execution of a task induces differences in subsequent resting-state FC ( ), or using a low demanding task with well-defined behavioural information as a surrogate of actual resting-state ( ). However, these are normally subtle effects, and other researchers have reported little or no differences in FC between task and rest ( ;  ). \n\nHere, we take a different route, by relating time-varying FC to population variability in behavioural traits. For this purpose, we implemented a framework to predict subject behavioural traits from either time-varying FC, time-averaged FC, or structural data. Critically, this was done in such a way that the prediction could be abstracted from the very distinct nature of the features used to represent each of the three modalities, allowing us to compare their relative and unique contribution to the prediction in an unbiased manner. Using different groups of behavioural traits, we used this approach to explore the relationship between population behaviour, time-averaged FC and time-varying FC, after accounting for the explanatory power of the structural connectivity features. We reasoned that if fMRI time-varying FC represents biologically meaningful communication between neuronal populations, then it should be capable of accounting for aspects of the subjects’ behavioural phenotypes not explained by the time-averaged FC or the structural information. We found that this was the case, particularly for the traits that are generally related to intelligence. \n\nTo measure time-varying fMRI FC, we used a state-based model where each state is associated with a specific pattern of FC ( ), such that instantaneous changes in FC manifest as a change of state. This approach is based on a version of the hidden Markov model (HMM) that, in comparison to previous versions of the HMM used on fMRI ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), emphasises changes in FC over changes in amplitude. To model each subject, the HMM uses a temporally-organised mixture of (quasi-) stable FC patterns in the form of region-by-region covariance matrices. This is an appropriate choice to compare time-varying FC with time-averaged FC, since time-averaged FC is also based on region-by-region covariance matrices. To model structural variability, we used fractional anisotropy (FA;  ), mean diffusivity (MD;  ) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM;  ). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn this section, we first summarise the basic steps of the analysis, which are presented in more detail in Methods, and then go on to show that there are aspects of behaviour that are uniquely expressed in both time-averaged and time-varying FC. We also show how each of these representations explicitly relate to each other, and to the structural data, in terms of their relation to behaviour. Overall, these analyses suggest that time-averaged and time-varying FC can indeed reflect separate aspects of brain activity. \n\n### Functional representations of the data \n  \nWe used 1003 subjects’ resting-state fMRI data with TR=750ms from the Human Connectome Project (HCP;  ), where each subject underwent four 15-min sessions (two per day). We used a data-driven parcellation obtained through spatial independent component analysis (ICA), and extracted 50 components ( ). The time series of these ICA components were then standardised separately for each session. \n\nWe considered two different FC-related representations of the data. The first representation is a time-averaged FC model, where we represented each subject as one (50 by 50) Pearson's correlation matrix across all ICA component time series ( ). Because the time series have unit-variance, these correlation matrices are equivalent to the corresponding covariance matrices. \n\nThe second representation corresponds to a time-varying FC model, where the ICA time series were fed to a hidden Markov model (HMM), which we first ran at the group level – i.e. on the concatenated time series for all subjects. The HMM represents the data as (i) a collection of states, each represented by a certain probability distribution; (ii) time series of state activation probabilities, one per state and time point, referred to as state time courses; and (iii) a transition probability matrix containing the probability of switching from one state to another within a session ( ;  ); see Methods and Fig SI-1 for an illustration. As opposed e.g. to   or  , which represented states using ordinary Gaussian distributions, here we implemented an HMM designed to emphasise periods in time with distinct FC (also see Fig SI-2 for a graphical, exemplary comparison). Specifically, each HMM state is represented by a covariance matrix across ICA components, so changes of state activations within session –expressed by the state time courses– correspond to modulations of covariance above and beyond the average covariance or FC. In this model, the state-specific covariances and transition probability matrix are estimated at the group level, whereas the state time courses are subject-specific ( ). Akin to the procedure known as dual regression in ICA ( ), we then performed a process of   dual-estimation   to obtain subject-specific versions of the group-level HMM in order to get a fuller subject-specific description of time-varying FC, where each subject has their own set of state-specific covariances (i.e., FC matrices), transition probability matrix, and state time courses. \n\nWe trained the models with eight states, without optimising for this number; previous work, however, suggested that the relations to behaviour are relatively robust across a reasonable range of states ( ). As often occurs with other models where the estimation depends on an optimisation process, the inference of the HMM can potentially produce different solutions depending on the initialisation ( ). Thus, in order to ensure that our conclusions were robust, we conducted five repetitions of the inference. \n\n\n### Prediction of behavioural variability \n  \nFrom the two functional representations just described, and the three considered anatomical descriptors (FA, MD, and VBM), we went on to assess how each of these can predict the considered behavioural traits. Within a 10-fold cross-validation scheme that respected the family structure of the HCP data ( ) by never splitting families between folds, we predicted a number of behavioural traits within six different groups of variables: demographic, cognitive, affective, personality and sleep-related (Table SI-1). The word “behavioural” is used here in a general sense, even though we included demographic and life-factor traits that are not purely behavioural. \n\nFor predicting behaviour, we used an approach based on distance matrices (DM) and cross-validated, motion-corrected kernel ridge regression (KRR;  ;  ;  ). Specifically, we computed (  N   by   N  ) distance matrices (DM), where   N   is the number of subjects and where the distances are calculated to capture how different a specific representation is between each pair of subjects. Overall, there is one representation for the time-averaged FC (i.e. the FC time-averaged network matrix), five representations for the HMM-based FC (i.e. one per repetition of the HMM inference), and one representation for each of the structural information measures (FA, MD, VBM); this yielded one time-averaged-FC-DM, five HMM-DMs (one per repetition of the inference), and three structural-DMs (FA-DM, MD-DM and VBM-DM). Therefore, whereas the approach to compute the distances is specific to each modality, all modalities end up being reduced to the same format (a DM); see Methods for details about how the pairwise distances for each modality were computed. The motivation of the KRR approach is two-fold. First, because the prediction is based exclusively on distances, we can decide on a sensible distance measure to use between different representations, instead of manually deciding what features to use to represent a representation. This offers a clean solution to the problem of how to make predictions using a complex object like an HMM, which it is not obvious how to convert into a vector of representative features; instead, using an appropriate measure to quantify how different two HMMs are is relatively straightforward. Second, having all types of representation (time-averaged FC, HMM or structural) in the same format (a DM) makes it easier to compare the explanatory power of each modality in predicting the subject traits, which otherwise could be heavily dependent on their specific parameterisation. See Methods for a mathematical description of KRR. \n\nWith the goal of exploring the influence of the structural information on the functional representations, we ran the predictions on the uncorrected behavioural traits, as well as on the behavioural traits after regressing out (deconfounding) the structural (FA, DM or VBM) information; see Methods for details. A scheme of the prediction procedure is illustrated in   for the dual-estimated HMMs: on top, the prediction from the structural information; at the bottom, the subsequent structure-deconfounded estimation from the dual-estimated HMM. The estimation for the time-averaged FC is analogous.   \nPrediction scheme using representations in terms of distance matrices (DM). On top, cross-validated prediction from the structural information; at the bottom, structure-deconfounded prediction from the dual-estimated HMM, which contains information of time-varying FC. The CV-deconfounded residuals represent the traits after discounting the influence of the structural information. An analogous procedure is used for the time-averaged FC \n  Fig 1   \n\n\n### Time-varying FC explains distinct aspects of behaviour \n  \nTaking into account the structural information, we next show that time-varying FC contains information from some behavioural traits that is not contained in the time-averaged FC, and vice versa that the time-averaged FC is a better predictor than the time-varying FC representation for other behavioural traits. \n\n shows a comparison of the prediction performances between the HMM representation and the time-averaged FC representation for the six behavioural groups listed in Table SI-1. This is presented for both the structure-deconfounded (i.e. for FA, MD and VBM; see above for details about deconfounding) and the non-deconfounded case. The top panels present the cross-validated explained variance (  r  , computed from Pearson's correlation) for the HMM and time-averaged FC representation; statistical significance through Bonferroni-corrected Student's t-tests is indicated by colour. Note that although the predictions are not very high ( ;  ), several are still significant. The middle panels reflect the difference between the two – which is positive when the HMM representation is a better predictor and negative otherwise; and the bottom panels contain an average of these differences per behavioural group. Statistical significance of whether one representation has a higher   r   than the other across traits is indicated within the bottom panels (*<0.05; **<0.01; permutation testing) for each behavioural group. Note that, as mentioned above, in the case of the HMM there are five different predictions per trait, one per run of the HMM inference; therefore, also, there are five prediction differences between the HMM and the time-averaged representation per trait, and five dots per trait in the middle panels. As observed, there is considerable variability in which type of representation (HMM- or time-averaged-FC-based) represents the traits better. Also, structure-deconfounding affects the prediction accuracy considerably, confirming previous studies on the influence of the structural information on FC-based predictions ( ;  ). In this regard, Fig SI-3 shows the loss of accuracy in percentage after correcting for the structure for each modality, grouped by behavioural group. As observed, the time-averaged representation is more affected by the corrections than the HMM-based representation. For reference, Fig SI-4 shows the (uncorrected) explained variance by each structural representation.   \nExplained variance   r   (in terms of squared Pearson's correlation) for the prediction of behavioural traits using the time-averaged-FC-DM and the HMM-DMs. In the top panels,   r   values (upwards for the HMM and downwards for the time-averaged representation; lighter colours represent statistically significant predictions and darker non-significant; Bonferroni-corrected Student's t-tests); in the middle panels, difference between the HMM and the time-average FC representations; in the bottom panels, the average differences aggregated by behavioural group (* and ** reflect statistical significance for significance levels of 0.05 and 0.01; permutation testing). \n  Fig 2   \n\nFrom this analysis, two conclusions are apparent. First and most importantly, that the behavioural groups are well separated by which representation is more effective in predicting them, with intelligence being particularly well predicted by the HMM representations. Second, that correcting by the structural information improves the relative performance of the HMM-DM compared to the time-averaged-FC-DM (see also Fig SI-3). \n\n\n### Changes in variance and amplitude of the signal do not explain behaviour \n  \nIn order to investigate the possibility that the predictions are primarily driven by within-session changes in the variance or amplitude of the signal instead of FC, we ran two additional varieties of the HMM. These will be compared with the FC-based version of the HMM used throughout the paper –here referred to as FC-HMM–, where each state is parametrised as a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and a full covariance matrix. In the first of the new varieties, referred to as mean-HMM, the states where characterised by Gaussian distributions with distinct patterns of signal amplitude (encoded in the mean parameter), and a common full covariance matrix shared across states. In the second, the var-HMM, the states were characterised by Gaussian distributions with a diagonal covariance matrix and zero mean, modelling just variance and not actual covariance between regions. In these models, the FC was not allowed to vary between states. Furthermore, while the mean-HMM takes into consideration the time-averaged FC through the shared covariance matrix, the var-HMM does not model FC at all.   presents the explained variance of the FC-HMM versus the explained variance of each of the other two HMM varieties. As observed, the explained variance for FC-HMM is consistently superior, highlighting the importance of accounting for time-varying FC above and beyond changes in amplitude and variance. Note that, although these models differ on the number of parameters and their complexity (which in principle could influence the quality of the predictions) here we are abstracting ourselves from these differences by performing the predictions on the base of DMs only. This means that the KRR models have always the same number of parameters regardless of the modality (see Methods)   \nBehavioural explained variance   r   (defined as squared Pearson's correlation) by the FC-based HMM model (which is the type of HMM used throughout the paper, Y-axis) vs (i) the mean-HMM, a type of HMM with one shared covariance matrix and one “mean” parameter per state that models changes in amplitude (top row; X-axis), and (ii) the Var-HMM, a type of HMM with state-specific variance parameters, i.e. with no cross-region covariances (bottom row; X-axis). \n  Fig 3   \n\n\n### Time-varying FC is more dissimilar to the structural information than time-averaged FC \n  \nThrough their differences in prediction accuracy of traits, we have investigated the amount of information contained in either the time-averaged or the time-varying FC representations with respect to behaviour. A complementary question is to what extent, specifically, do these brain representations contain similar or different information about behaviour. That is, if two representations are very similar with respect to a given behavioural group, that means that they represent similar information about that specific aspect of behaviour; if they are very dissimilar, it means that their information about the behavioural group is mostly non-overlapping. \n\nFor each group of behavioural traits (see Table SI-1), we correlated the trait predictions between each pair of brain representations: time-averaged FC, each of the three structural measures, and each of the five HMM runs for the three HMM configurations described in the previous section (i.e. FC-HMM, which is the main model used throughout this study; mean-HMM, which only models the amplitude; and var-HMM, which models changes in variance). In the spirit of the   Representation Similarity Analysis   literature ( ), this procedure produced a (no. of brain representations by no. of brain representations) similarity matrix per behavioural group, capturing how correlated the prediction of the behavioural traits was between each pair of representations. \n\nA presents the corresponding similarity matrices, for each behavioural group. The five matrices have some common patterns but some differences are also apparent. The most relevant pattern here is that, in all cases, the structural representations were much more related (in terms of explaining behaviour) to the time-averaged FC than to the FC-HMM representations, confirming that time-varying FC is more unrelated to the structure than time-averaged FC. This is further explored in  B, where we show the probability density of the corresponding correlations in terms of explaining behaviour between the structural representations on the one hand and either the FC-HMM (blue) or the time-averaged FC (red) representations on the other hand. The probability densities of the correlations were estimated by bootstrapping ( ). As observed, the differences are large and significant (p<0.001, bootstrap-based testing). We can also observe that the five FC-HMM representations are more consistent in explaining the demographic traits (i.e. the correlation between HMM runs is higher) than they are in the other behavioural groups, and they are also more related to the time-averaged FC representation for this behavioural group than for the others. The latter point can be seen in  C, which shows the probability density of correlations (estimated by bootstrapping) between the FC-HMM and the time-averaged FC in terms of how they explain each behavioural group. The larger similarity for the demographic group is apparent. The other two types of HMM estimations, having fewer parameters and without capturing any information about time-varying FC, are in general more similar across runs and quite different from the FC-HMM, indicating that the FC-HMM approach is unlikely to be purely driven by changes in amplitude. In terms of the structural information, MD and FA are fairly similar to each other for all behavioural groups, but their similarity to VBM varies according to the behavioural group (highest for intelligence and sleep; lowest for demography).   \nA. How similar are the different representations in explaining behaviour? Similarity matrices (in terms of Pearson's correlation) capturing how similar the prediction of behavioural traits was between each pair of representations are shown for each of the five behavioural groups: time-averaged FC, HMM-based representations including time-varying FC (FC-HMM; used throughout the paper), HMM representations including only changes in amplitude (mean-HMM) or variance (var-HMM), and structural (FA, MD and VBM). B. Distribution densities (obtained via bootstrapping) of between-modality correlations (in terms of explaining behaviour) show that the time-averaged FC representation is more related to the structural representations than the time-varying FC (p<0.001, bootstrap hypothesis testing). C. The correlations between the time-varying and the time-averaged FC representations are higher for the demographic traits than for the other behavioural groups (p<0.001, bootstrap hypothesis testing). \n  Fig 4   \n\nAltogether, this analysis revealed clear differences and similarities between the different neuroimaging representations in terms of explaining behaviour, and provides further evidence that time-varying FC is more unrelated to the anatomy than the time-averaged FC. \n\n\n### Reproducibility of DMs \n  \nThe reproducibility of the estimation of both the representations and the behavioural predictions can be relevant in terms, for example, of a clinical application. In the previous section, we have considered how different estimations of the various representations differ in their relation to behaviour. Here, we analyse another aspect the representations’ reproducibility: how robust are these representations, per se, across scanning sessions. \n\nThe HCP data contains four sessions per subject, with the first two (1 and 2) being acquired on one day and the last two (3 and 4) on the following day. In order to further quantify the reproducibility of the estimations, we estimated separate time-averaged FC and (FC-)HMM models for the first day and for the second day, i.e. for sessions 1 and 2, and then for sessions 3 and 4. We also estimated models for the first session of the day, and then separately for the second session of the day. For each of these two half-split estimations, (HMM- or time-averaged FC-related), we then computed DMs.   presents a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of the estimations in terms of how similar their respective DMs were across half-splits of the data. Here, the dots represent a measure of distance between one pair of subjects.   \nReproducibility of the estimations between the first and the second day of scanning (top), and between the first session and the second session of each day (bottom), for the HMM (left) and the time-averaged FC representation (right). Each dot corresponds to an element of the DM, i.e. a distance measure between a pair of subjects, and the colour reflect the density of dots. For each panel, the correlation between the DMs (i.e. across dots) is reported as a Pearson's correlation   r  . \n  Fig 5   \n\nAs expected, the reproducibility within day is considerably larger than between days for both types of representation. Importantly, the time-averaged FC description (being a simpler quantity to estimate) exhibits in general a higher between-session reproducibility than the HMM representation ( ). This can be due to the time-averaged FC not just being a simpler quantity to estimate, but also to the HMM being potentially better able to capture session-specific information thanks to its time-resolved nature. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn resting state fMRI, the quantification of time-varying functional connectivity (FC) has elicited considerable interest and controversy: that is, to what extent can we measure and interpret within-session changes in the patterns of FC between areas? Whereas many studies rely on the average magnitude of activation that is evoked by a task or stimulus, FC is a second-order statistic and therefore is harder to estimate accurately. Similarly, it is unclear whether FC can reflect changing patterns of communication between distant neuronal populations, and therefore be meaningful for investigating cognition. Even though the total amount of between-subject variability attributed to stable subject FC features (i.e. that do not change within session and are preserved for each subject across sessions) is considerably higher than the within-session variability (i.e. that change within a session;  ), here we show that fMRI-derived FC indeed contains both stable and time-varying behaviourally meaningful information, and that time-varying FC can explain behavioural variability that is less likely to be mediated by structural connectivity and other anatomical features. This suggests that time-varying FC may represent meaningful neuronal dynamics related to certain aspects of behaviour. As a consequence, the study of FC fluctuations remains promising for the understanding of transient cognition. \n\nTo answer this question, it is informative to disentangle the different mechanisms by which time-varying FC computed from fMRI data could be non-informative: first, the characterisation of time-varying FC may be limited by fundamentally technical issues; second, the actual amount of information contained in the time variations, when assessed unbiasedly, may be negligible; and third, even if we can prove that there is non-negligible information in time-varying FC that can be reliably quantified, it may still not be cognitively significant. We argue that certain technical limitations do not apply to all methods of estimating time-varying FC equally. In the case of the HMM, for example, the technical limitation of having a statistically unstable estimation due to limited amounts of data (e.g. when using sliding windows) is overcome by using large amounts of data in the estimation of each state through the ability to pool over all the data from repeated visits to the state (on average, 125h per state in the present data set). \n\nIt has been shown that the time-averaged (subject-specific) FC features represent most of the variance in fMRI data ( ). However, the fact that time-varying FC explains considerably less variance does not necessarily mean that time-varying FC is deficient in explaining behavioural traits. We consider that discussing the physiological relevance of a brain representation in terms of explained variance (of the data) is not appropriate for two reasons: (i) that “physiological relevance” must be connected to a specific scientific question – e.g. relevant to the study of attention; and (ii) that, provided such a question, there is not prior evidence that the most informative aspect of the signal (for that question) is the one that explains the most variance in the data. For example, in the context of prediction it is a well-known phenomenon that the first principal components of the predictor data are not necessarily the most explanatory to predict the target variable ( ). As an example closer to neuroscience, electrophysiological signals hold most of their variance at lower frequencies. In comparison, only a small fraction of variance is contained e.g. in the gamma frequencies (>40 Hz). These, however, have been demonstrated to be essential to behaviour ( ). In summary, the argument that there is considerably more variability in the between-subject than in the within-subject differences cannot be used to claim the lack of biological relevance of these features. \n\n### Relation to previous work \n  \nSome of the conclusions of this study relate to the recent work from  , who found, in fMRI, that the autoregressive model (which linearly represents how on average the signal at time point   t   depends across regions on the signal at time point   t  -1) was often more explanatory of behavioural variability than the standard time-averaged FC estimation. Because the autoregressive model is known to describe the dynamics of the signal well ( ), the conclusion of this study was that the dynamic aspects of the data can often explain behaviour better than (average) instantaneous fMRI correlations. Critically, there is a conceptual distinction between a model of the multivariate dynamics of the system (as captured by the autoregressive model) and time-varying FC (as captured by the HMM) that is important to the message of this study. Specifically, while both the HMM and the autoregressive model can capture time-varying FC, the autoregressive model also captures other elements such as spectral information ( ), while the HMM captures aspects of the data that the autoregressive model does not explicitly account for, such as the identification of time-resolved transient events. Therefore, the autoregressive model is not able to answer our question, which is focussed specifically on FC: i.e., do variations over time in the fMRI FC have biological significance above and beyond the temporally averaged FC, and also the structural information? This question is important as it speaks to the extent to which FC can represent instantaneous neural communication. These questions require a model that explicitly considers variations around the time-averaged FC in a way that is not mixed with these other elements. The version of the HMM used here is one way to achieve this, but not the only one. Other data descriptions capturing related or different aspects could also be considered, such as those based on signal events ( ) or quasi-periodic patterns ( ). \n\nIt is worth noticing that, in accordance with the growing body of work on predicting behavioural traits from functional connectivity on the HCP data, the predictions were modest; see  ,  ,   and   among many others. However, these are still clearly significant ( ;  ), allowing us to disentangle the time-varying from the time-averaged FC behavioural relevance in terms of trait prediction. Future work will aim at replicating these results on the UK Biobank, where higher prediction accuracies have been observed ( ). \n\n\n### Limitations and open questions \n  \nIt is also important to appreciate that neither the HMM nor other commonly used time-varying FC estimators are explicitly biophysical models. Decisions about the appropriate number of states and other parameters are useful insofar as they affect the extent to which we can address the specific question at hand. For example, estimating more states will offer a more fine-grained representation of the data, which might be necessary in certain applications but cannot be interpreted as more or less faithful to the biology. In general, different parametrisations just offer different perspectives of the data, and, assuming model identifiability, the HMM is not more or less valid than other models. We also acknowledge that, while the version of the HMM used in this work is designed to emphasise time-varying FC, it could also be sensitive to changes in amplitude ( ). However, we have explicitly tested that a version of the HMM only based on changes in amplitude is unable to explain behaviour to the same extent, emphasising the importance of time-varying FC. Other aspects of the data that can influence the HMM estimation are long-range temporal dependencies, which are not explicitly modelled by the HMM ( ). A quantitative assessment of the long-term dependencies in the data and how they affect the HMM estimation will be subject of future work. \n\nAn important methodological consideration is that, even though all the representations are unbiasedly compared at the level of prediction because of their common DM representation, our analysis still depends on the choice of how to compute the distances. For example, in this study we used a Kullback-Leibler divergence approximation to compute distances between HMM representations ( ; see Methods). Alternatively, one could compute differences purely based on the temporal aspects of the model (e.g. the transition probability matrix) or its spatial properties. Related to this point, the merits of kernel-based approaches come at the expense of neuroanatomical interpretation: since we no longer have one regression coefficient per spatial area, but one regression coefficient per subject (see Methods), and given also that the distances matrices (on which the prediction is based) are computed in an unsupervised fashion, it is not straightforward to see which areas have actually driven the prediction. Future work will address these questions, including how to compute between-model distances as part of the prediction and in an interpretable manner, so that the most predictive features of the models are identified in a data-driven way. \n\nOne aspect to consider about models for which inversion does not have a mathematically closed formulation (as is the case of ICA and the HMM among many others – but not of Pearson's correlation or the autoregressive model) is the fact that, every time we estimate the model, we might get a slightly different description of the data insofar as the estimation has a random seed (see for example  ). Even though the HMM inference is relatively stable on this data set ( ), that is not guaranteed to be the case always. Again, these are not biophysical models, so all estimations are theoretically valid as far as they are considered as what they are: data-driven descriptions. Although there exist statistical testing approaches available to combine across estimations so that statistical power is boosted ( ), in this work we have analysed each estimation separately to ensure the comparability of the results. \n\nA further caveat is that the ICA maps are known to contain important subject-specific differences that can be relevant to behaviour ( ). These differences were not considered in this paper, as we estimated both time-varying and time-averaged FC using only the ICA time series. In future work, we will study the combination of these analyses with techniques that are more suitable to account for this information ( ). \n\nFinally, it is worth noting that, to be conservative, we have performed the (group-level) HMM estimation within the cross-validation loop. However, since the HMM estimation is completely unsupervised and does not make any use of the labels, it would have been also correct to obtain the (dual-estimated) HMMs prior to, and outside of, the prediction cross-validation loop. Whether or not this is acceptable to do depends on the practicalities of the application. For example, if we wish to predict whether a new subject is going to develop a disease in the future given their brain data, it would not be a problem to rerun, on the entire data set (i.e. including the new subject), an unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm (like the HMM) before doing the prediction as far as such algorithm is unsupervised. Doing this would not make a diagnosis any less valid – only perhaps slower. But sometimes we would not have access to the original data at the time of prediction, in which case a proper validation of the method would need to cross-validate the HMM estimation as we did here. \n\nIn summary, this study presents methods to use different sources of brain data and/or models for prediction, in a way that makes comparisons possible in terms of their explanatory power of behavioural or clinical variables. Using this method, we have shown that time-averaged and time-varying FC explain distinct aspects of behaviour, above and beyond the behavioural variability expressed on the considered structural brain data. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe provide some details on preprocessing, the nature of the hidden Markov model estimation and its different varieties, the computation of the distances between each pair of subjects for each of the considered measures or subject variables, and the use of kernel regression to test the relation between imaging and non-imaging variables, how we accounted for the structural information and the influence of motion. \n\n### Preprocessing \n  \nWe used the “minimal preprocessed” data from the HCP. Since the preprocessing of this data has already been described in detail ( ), we will provide an overview here. Structured artefact removal using independent component analysis (ICA) and FIX ( ) removed more than 99% of the artefactual ICA components in the data set. No low-pass temporal filter was used, and only minimal high-pass filtering was applied (cutoff= 2000s), essentially removing the linear trends of the data. Since ICA-based methods have been shown to better characterise the signal than other data-driven approaches such as k-means (in particular on the HCP data;  ), we used group spatial-ICA to obtain a “parcellation” of 50 components that covers both the cortical surfaces and the subcortical areas (without using global signal regression). This parcellation was then used to project the fMRI data into 50-dimensional time series. These time series were finally standardised separately for each scan, subject and ICA component.. \n\n\n### An FC-focused hidden Markov model \n  \nThe hidden Markov model (HMM) is a probabilistic framework used to model time series using a finite number of recurring patterns that succeed each other in some order ( ). The key assumptions of this approach are: that the data can be reasonably represented using a discrete number of probabilistic models; that occurrence of these models is exclusive – i.e. the state time courses’ summation across states is one for each time point; and that we can reasonably model the states dynamics by a Markovian process – i.e. that the probability of a state being active depends purely on the data and which state is active in the previous time point. \n\nEach of these patterns or states are an instantiation of a certain probability distribution. The HMM is generic in the sense that it can accommodate different state probability distributions, depending of the type of data we are processing and the features that we wish to model. A suitable state choice for fMRI data is the Gaussian distribution ( ), where each state, indexed by   k  , is modelled by a certain \"mean activity  \"   parameter   μ   and a covariance matrix   Σ  . Let   x   be the data at time point   t   – i.e. the value of the ICA time courses at   t  . The probability density function that describes   x  , assuming that state   k   is active at time   t  , is given by where   J   is the number of brain regions (here ICA components), |  Σ  | is the determinant of the state-specific covariance matrix   Σ   and exp is the exponential function. Here,   Σ   represents the covariance of the residuals, i.e. after subtracting the mean parameter   μ   to the signal. \n\nIn this paper, each state is parametrised as Gaussian distribution with no mean parameter. Note that the interpretation of   Σ   as FC is not analogous to what is typically referred to when time-varying FC is assessed using sliding-window analysis ( ). This is because, as opposed to sliding windows, in this type of HMM the mean   μ   is also allowed to be time-varying. Therefore, in order to focus the HMM decomposition on the FC changes, and in order to make the HMM estimation more comparable to standard analyses of time-varying FC, we enforced   μ   = 0, by describing the probability density function for state   k   as where   Σ   represents state-specific FC. In this model,   Σ   is assumed to be distributed as a Wishart distribution. Note that this is equivalent to having each state being Wishart distributed. Importantly, this model carries information of   both   time-averaged FC and time-varying FC. \n\nAnother important element of the HMM, also estimated from the data, is the transition probability matrix (TPM), which encodes the probability of transitioning from one state to another at any time point. Practically speaking, the TPM serves two purposes: it identifies the transitions that are more probable, and it regularises the state switching to minimise the amount of spurious transitions. In particular, whenever we have a more persistent (temporally regularised) solution, the diagonal elements will be comparably larger than the off-diagonal elements of the TPM. \n\nThe estimation of the HMM, carried out through a procedure of Bayesian variational inference ( ;  ), was first computed at the group level, such that the state probability distributions were shared across subject – though the state time courses and the time spent in each state were subject-specific. \n\nNext, we computed subject-specific HMMs using a process that we refer to as   dual-estimation   (in analogy to dual-regression in ICA;  ). To do this, we simply used the subject-specific state time courses to compute a subject-specific estimation the states; then, based on these state estimations, we recomputed the state time courses and the TPM for each subject. In order to make cross-validated behavioural predictions (see below), we followed the conservative procedure of estimating the group-level HMM only on the cross-validation training sets, so that, afterwards, we could obtain the dual-estimated HMMs on both the training and testing sets. \n\n\n### The HMM contains time-averaged FC information \n  \nThe HMM contains information not just on time-varying FC (how FC changes within each session), but also regarding the time-averaged FC (the subject-specific FC information that remains stable across sessions for each subject). This is because it is possible to fully reconstruct the time-averaged FC estimation from the dual-estimated HMM simply by computing a weighted average of the states’ covariance (FC) matrices for each subject, where the weights are given by the fractional occupancies and the fractional occupancies are defined as the total proportion of time spent at each state for every given subject ( ). \n\nGiven   N   subjects and   K   states, the group level HMM estimation represents some of the subject-specific time-averaged (or static) FC (avFC) information, according to the following expression: where   i   indexes subjects and   represents the fractional occupancy for subject   i   and state   k   (i.e. the total time spent on that state for that subject). Given that the number of states is lower than the number of subjects (  K   <   N  ), this is an approximation, and therefore there is some time-averaged FC information that is not captured by the HMM. Likewise, the HMM has information (for example in the TPM) that is not captured by a standard time-averaged FC estimation; formally, we refer to this differential information as time-varying FC. \n\nAs opposed to the group level estimation, the dual-estimated HMM estimation captures all the time-averaged FC information where   d-e   denotes dual-estimated. This is because: where   is the probability for subject   i   to be in state   k   at time point   t  ,   by the definition of a probability, and  . \n\n\n### The HMM contains time-varying FC information \n  \nWe have established that the HMM contains some time-averaged FC information. But, to which extent does the HMM capture time-varying FC information, above and beyond the time-averaged FC? \n\nAs a sanity check, in Fig. SI-5 we show that the time-averaged FC contains information that is essentially uncorrelated to the FC temporal variability. To compute a measure of the extent to which there is time-varying FC for each pair of regions, we first constructed an instantaneous estimate of FC at each time point, using a weighted sum of the dual-estimated HMM states’ FC, weighted by the assigned HMM state probabilities at that time point. We then took the variance of these instantaneous estimates of FC across time to produce a (regions-by-regions) matrix of estimated FC temporal variability for each given subject. We then compared this to the time-averaged FC, confirming that these are unrelated. \n\n\n### Other HMMs with no time-varying FC information \n  \nPreviously, we have shown that the dual-estimated HMMs contain all the information there is about time-averaged FC. Having   K   FC descriptions per subject instead of one, plus a TPM ruling the transitions between these states, it is apparent that the HMM contains additional information beyond time-averaged FC. An important question is then what that additional information represents. There are three possible sources of variability: actual within-session changes of FC (i.e. time-varying FC), within-session changes in the variance of the signal, and estimation noise. By meaningfully relating the HMM information to behaviour above and beyond the influence of time-averaged FC (see below, and Results) we can rule out the possibility that the HMM extra parameters are purely noise-driven. However, given that both variances and correlations (i.e. FC) are part of the state descriptions, there is no straightforward analytical way to disambiguate how much these two elements drove the inference of the HMM. In order to prove the relevance of pure time-varying FC in the HMM estimation, we obtained alternative HMM estimations where the states are purely derived by changes in the variance of the signal. The probability density function of this model is given by where   represents multiplication across regions,   is the variance for region   j   and state   k  , and   is the value of the signal for region   j   at time point   t  . \n\nThe fact that HMM using full covariances matrices can explain aspects of behaviour that this model was unable to explain (see  ) suggests that there is relevant information in the HMM that is not related to changes in variance. \n\nEven though the mean parameter of the Gaussian distribution (which reflects the amount of activity of each state with respect to the average signal) was not included in the model in the first place, we estimated a third HMM model where the states were solely defined by the mean, i.e. without state-specific covariances – and with a shared, global covariance. The purpose of this analysis is to rule out the possibility that this type of information, though not explicitly included in the HMM description used here, permeated the state covariance matrices and determined the HMM inference. The probability density function of this model is given by  with one single covariance matrix   shared across states. Note that this model holds important similarities with ICA, in the sense that each state or component is represented by a map of activation. Again, as reflected in  , this model is less predictive of behaviour. \n\n\n### Measures of structural variability \n  \nWe applied independent component analysis (implemented by the Melodic tool in FSL;  ) on the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) values for each subject across the whole brain (2mm resolution); resulting in 50 independent components of FA, MD, and VBM variability across subjects. \n\nIn more detail, the structural T1 weighted data was preprocessed using the computational analysis toolbox (CAT)−12 ( ), which extends the SPM's VBM pipeline ( ). Before grey matter volume estimation, all participants’ T1 images were affinely aligned, segmented, normalized, and bias-field-corrected, yielding images containing grey and white matter segments and CSF. DARTEL ( ) was then used to normalize all images to a standard grey matter template provided by CAT-12. Subsequently, all grey matter volumes were smoothed with a 9.4 mm FWHM Gaussian smoothing kernel (sigma = 4 mm). The diffusion weighted data was preprocessed using the DTIFIT routine from FSL ( ) in order to extract FA and MD. More details about structural preprocessing can be found in  . \n\n\n### Measuring dissimilarities between subjects \n  \nThe kernel-based prediction algorithm employed in this paper is based on distance matrices (DM) containing the dissimilarities between each pair of subjects within the geometrical space defined by each type of representation (see  ). As mentioned, the main purpose of this approach here is to abstract ourselves from the specifics of each representation (e.g. time-averaged or time-varying FC) and their complexity, so that the prediction is made in a comparable fashion. Furthermore, there is not a straightforward way to unwrap the parameters of an HMM model into a vector of predictive features, so that a standard regression model can be applied. Because it is possible to compute distances between HMM models more straightforwardly, a kernel-based approach is a more natural way to make predictions in this case. \n\nWe next detail how to compute DMs in the spaces defined by the different imaging-based modalities: time-varying FC, time-averaged FC, and structural. \n\nWe first discuss the HMM model, which, as discussed above, contains information about both the time-averaged FC and time-varying FC. In particular, we computed the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence between each pair of (dual estimated) subject HMMs, denoted as   M   and   M  . where KL(  M   ||   M  ) represents the standard (non-symmetric) Kullback-Leibler divergence between probabilistic models   M   and   M  . More specifically, the Kullback-Leibler divergence represents how much information a probability distribution contains in relation to a second reference probability distribution. Whereas the Kullback-Leibler divergence has a closed form for various well-known distributions (e.g. the Gaussian distribution), this is not the case for more complex probability distributions such as the one represented by the HMM. For this reason, we adapted the mathematical approximation proposed by   for discrete state distributions to the Gaussian case: where   represents the (Dirichlet-distributed) probabilities of transitioning from state   k   to any of the other states according to model   i   (i.e. the   k  -th row of the TPM);   is the state Gaussian distribution for state   k   and model   i  ; and   ν   is a factor representing the weight of state   k   in   M   (see below). Given the initial probabilities   π   of the HMM state time courses for model   M   (which are computed from the data together with the TPM),   ν   can be numerically computed such that it meets the following necessary criteria (see  ): \n\nThe expressions for   and   are standard and can be found elsewhere ( ). The code to compute the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence between two HMM models is provided in . Note that these expressions require the states to be matched between HMM models; i.e. the first state of   must correspond to the first state of  . This is guaranteed here by the fact that the dual-estimated HMMs are derived from the same group-level HMM. \n\nThe second type of DM corresponds to the time-averaged FC. To keep the comparisons fair, and in line with the approach taken for the time-varying FC, we described the time-averaged FC by fitting a Gaussian distribution per subject. Given that the time series were standardised for each subject (i.e. they are demeaned and have variance equal to 1.0), the resulting Gaussian distributions only contain a covariance matrix that is mathematically equivalent to using a Pearson's correlation matrix. The time-averaged FC's DM was computed using the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence between each pair of the subject-specific Gaussian distributions, \n\nNote that, because this way we are taking into account the non-Euclidean geometry of the covariance matrices, this approach is mathematically more principled and therefore statistically more efficient than using correlations across the off-diagonal elements of the FC matrices (as is more commonly done in the literature). \n\nFinally, the third type of DM is computed from the structural information, using the three considered structural measures: FA, MD and VBM. As discussed earlier, we have 50 ICA components for each measure, so the data consist of 50 weights per subject in each case. Given that there is no specific geometrical constrain on these values, we just used Euclidean distances between each pair of subjects in order to estimate the corresponding DMs. \n\n\n### Predicting subject traits using kernel ridge regression \n  \nOur goal is to capture the relationship between the representations of the brain imaging data (time-varying FC, time-averaged FC, and structural information) and subject traits. One way to achieve this is by regressing a set of nonlinear mappings of the imaging-derived features onto the behavioural traits, e.g.: where  is the (  N   by 1) behavioural trait of subject   i  , and   is a nonlinear function that operates on a representation   of the brain imaging data. To implement this regression model, we need to specify the choice of the function   and also the imaging-derived features it should operate on – a not straightforward task. \n\nAn alternative and simpler approach to working with this regression model is to take advantage of the so-called kernel trick, whereby predictions of an out-of-sample subject's behavioural trait,  , are made to depend on a kernel function without the need of manually defining   ( ). Specifically, we use kernel ridge regression (KRR), which is formulated as where   is a (  N   by 1) vector of KRR weights, and   represent the observed (  N   by 1) vector of values of the behavioural trait from the training CV-fold. As shown in the mathematical derivations by  , we can make use of the kernel trick to estimate   as where   is a regularisation parameter. As with other kernel-based approaches, such as the support vector machine or Gaussian processes, KRR works on a (  N   by   N  ; where   N   is the number of subjects) kernel matrix   Η  , which is computed by applying some kernel function on the corresponding DM. Here, we chose a Gaussian radial basis function kernel, parametrised by a radius parameter τ ( ): where   is the distance between the representation for two different subjects within the training CV-fold, and   is the corresponding element of the kernel matrix. That is, once we have computed the corresponding DM, the KRR approach does not need to consider where these distances come from. The choice of the Gaussian kernel function is motivated by the fact that it generalises well to most domains, given its lack of strong assumptions ( ). On these grounds,   h   is a (1 by   N  ) vector containing the result of applying the Gaussian kernel to the   N   distances between each of the subjects in the training set and subject   i   in the test CV-fold. \n\nIn summary, the KRR formulation (also benchmarked in a neuroimaging context against deep learning methods by  ) is equivalent to having a nonlinear prediction using an explicit nonlinear function  , but without having to directly design, use, or even know, such function; instead, we only need to specify a distance measure between the representations (e.g. of the HMMs, the structural images, or the time-averaged FC matrices) and a valid kernel function. The code for KRR, which uses a nested cross-validation loop to select both   and τ, is provided in  . \n\n\n### Accounting for brain structure in the predictions \n  \nA central goal of this paper is to assess how the predictive power of the time-averaged and time-varying FC representations relates to the anatomy. For this purpose, we used cross-validated KRR to estimate FA-, DM- and VBM-based predictions for each behavioural trait, using their respective DMs. That is, we estimated regularised KRR coefficients on the training folds and applied them on each testing fold, in turn, to eventually produce an (  N   by 1) vector of predicted traits for each behavioural variable and structural modality. Then, we computed the corresponding residuals as the difference between the predicted and the empirical traits, and used these as FA-, MD- or VBM-deconfounded behavioural traits in the subsequent time-averaged-FC-based and HMM-based predictions. Cross-validation-based deconfounding was chosen because it is less aggressive and biased than standard deconfounding ( ). \n\n\n### Motion correction \n  \nSince motion is known to influence both the estimation of time-varying FC and the prediction of behavioural variables, we used FIX and confound regressors at the level of the individual subject time series ( ). Furthermore, we included the derived motion parameters as confounds in the KRR prediction in order to also control for between-subject differences in motion. \n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"037207ee9720ca68669c44057cca8a7d"},

AVHs are defined as hearing and perceiving voices in the absence of an external auditory stimulus. Based on the technology of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), recent findings suggested that AVHs might be traced back to abnormally intrinsic functional organizations involving multiple brain regions and networks (Cui et al.,  ; Hoffman et al.,  ; Kumari et al.,  ; Northoff & Qin,  ; Scheinost et al.,  ; Silbersweig et al.,  ; Simons et al.,  ; Stripeikyte et al.,  ). Although multiple existing conceptual models of AVHs, such as top‐down and bottom‐up (Hugdahl,  ), corollary discharge (Ford et al.,  ), nondominant language intrusion (Sommer et al.,  ; van Lutterveld et al.,  ), and interhemispheric miscommunication (Curcic‐Blake et al.,  ; Gavrilescu et al.,  ), were indicated by the previous studies, it is unclear which model is the most relevant for AVHs. \n\nA large number of resting‐state fMRI studies indicate abnormal local and long‐range connectivity in AVHs (Chang et al.,  ;C. Chen, Wang, et al.,  ; Hare et al.,  ; Mondino et al.,  ; Zhuo et al.,  ). Local functional connectivity was usually estimated using regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis, and long‐range connectivity was usually estimated using resting‐state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis (Hare et al.,  ). On the one hand, the researchers, respectively, explored local and long‐range connectivity and found abnormal local and long‐range connectivity mainly in the frontal and temporal language‐related areas (Chang et al.,  ; Hoffman & Hampson,  ; Vercammen et al.,  ; Wolf et al.,  ; Zheng et al.,  ; Zhuo et al.,  ). On the other hand, Chen, Wang, et al. ( ), Chen, Cui, et al. ( ), and Cui et al. ( ), respectively, utilized both the two measurements and found that schizophrenia patients with AVHs showed stronger ReHo in the putamen and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and weaker rsFC between the putamen and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Moreover, structure functional analysis also indicated stronger interhemispheric auditory connectivity in schizophrenia patients with AVHs (Mulert et al.,  ; Steinmann et al.,  ). Chang et al. ( ) adopted a newly developed index, voxel‐mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), to quantitatively describe interhemispheric functional connectivity, and showed aberrant bilateral connectivity of default mode network (DMN), IFG, and cerebellum in the AVH group. These inconsistent findings mean that it is important and necessary to investigate abnormal interhemispheric and intrahemispheric functional connectivity in AVHs across the board using a better approach. The analysis of functional connectivity density (FCD) represents the number of connections between voxels throughout the global or interhemispheric and intrahemispheric brain and is a data‐driven graph theory method, which can identify the distribution of highly connected hubs in brain networks (Bullmore & Sporns,  ; Lee et al.,  ; J. Zhu et al.,  ). To the best of our knowledge, the previous studies adopted FCD to explore altered voxel‐wise interhemispheric and intrahemispheric functional connectivity in schizophrenia patients (Agcaoglu et al.,  ; Y. Zhang et al.,  ; F. Zhu et al.,  ; F. Zhu et al.,  ) but not in AVHs. The previous studies only found abnormal ROI‐wise interhemispheric connections between auditory and language‐related areas (Curcic‐Blake et al.,  ; Gavrilescu et al.,  ). The language, auditory, and memory/limbic networks are of particular relevance for AVHs (Ćurčić‐Blake et al.,  ). Therefore, voxel‐wise interhemispheric and intrahemispheric FCD might be necessary to identify the distribution of highly connected hubs in abnormal brain networks for AVHs. \n\nThe above abnormal connections in schizophrenia patients with AVHs are static. The traditional functional connectivity, including interhemispheric and intrahemispheric parts, is based on the implicit assumption of spatial and temporal stationary of fMRI data, which is over simple for complex activities of the human brain (Allen et al.,  ). When the mental activity is unconstrained, dynamics are potentially even more prominent under the resting state. Evidence suggested that dynamic functional connectivity supply us new information about abnormal functional connectivity on the brain of patients with various diseases (Chen et al.,  ; Y. Chen, Cui, et al.,  ; Demirtaş et al.,  ; Y. Li et al.,  ; R. Wang, Sun, et al.,  ; J. Zhu et al.,  ). Previous findings showed altered dynamic functional connectivity in the DMN and the language network in schizophrenia patients with AVHs (Geng et al.,  ; Weber et al.,  ; W. Zhang et al.,  ). Moreover, Guo et al. ( ) explored altered temporal variability of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dynamic FCD (dFCD) using a sliding window approach in autism spectrum disorder, and the interhemispheric and intrahemispheric FCD were discomposed from the whole‐brain FCD. Although numerous studies explored the neural mechanism of AVHs, it was unclear whether schizophrenia patients with AVHs exhibited abnormal intrahemispheric and interhemispheric dFCD. \n\nIn this study, we explored the temporal variability of voxel‐wise contralateral and ipsilateral dFCD, denoting the interhemispheric and intrahemispheric parts, in drug‐naïve first‐episode schizophrenia (FES) patients with AVHs. The intrahemispheric and interhemispheric of the dFCD were further quantified using the standard deviation of dFCD variance patterns across time. Then, we compared the temporal changes of the intrahemispheric and interhemispheric dFCD between schizophrenia patients with AVHs and without AVH (NAVH) and healthy subjects. Moreover, the correlation analysis was performed between clinical measures with significant results between groups. In this study, we aimed to find abnormal temporal variability of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD in schizophrenia patients with AVHs and hypothesized that these might be exhibited in the pivotal components of auditory and language pathways. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThis study randomly recruited 100 drug‐naïve FES patients and 50 age‐ and sex‐matched healthy controls (HCs) (Table  ). All patients did not take any antipsychotic drugs. Schizophrenia diagnosis by a psychiatric specialist was made using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM‐IV). The illness duration of all patients was less than 3 years, and the diapause was less than 6 months. Symptom severity of schizophrenia was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Fifty patients reported experiencing AVHs within the past 4 weeks, most within the past week, while the other 50 patients reported no AVH in their lifetime or in the past 4 months. This was based on the PANSS scores at the time of screening, as well as detailed information regarding past symptomatology that was acquired in patient interviews and examination of the patients' medical records. The severity of AVHs was assessed using the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS). Eleven patients reported that the voices appeared at least once a week; the other 39 patients reported hearing these voices at least once a day. Twelve patients reported that the voices continued for several seconds at a time; 26 patients reported voices lasting several minutes; 5 patients reported voices lasting more than an hour; and 7 patients reported that the voices could continue for several hours at a time. We collected PANSS data for 33 of the AVH patients and for all NAVH patients and collected AHRS data for all AVH patients. All participants were right handed. Exclusion criteria for all participants were as follows: (1) contraindications for MRI, (2) alcohol or drug abuse, and (3) severe physical disability or traumatic head injury. HCs had no history of neurological or psychiatric illness. All subjects gave the informed consent, and this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. \n  \nThe demographic and clinical data of schizophrenia patients, with and without AVH, and healthy controls \n    \n\n### Data acquisition \n  \nAll subjects were scanned using a 3.0 T MRI scanner (Discovery MR750, GE, USA) with an eight‐channel receiver array head coil. Head motion and scanner noise were reduced using foam padding and earplugs. All participants were asked to remain alert with their eyes closed. We collected MRI data from all participants. Structural images were acquired using a 3D T1 BRAVO sequence with the following settings: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 8.2/3.2 ms, slice number = 188, slice thickness = 1 mm, slice gap = 0 mm, flip angle = 12°, field of view (FOV) = 25.6 × 25.6 cm , number of averages = 1, matrix size = 256 × 256, voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm , scan time = 4.33 min. Functional images were acquired transversely with gradient spin echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following settings: TR/TE = 2000/30 ms, slice number = 32, slice thickness = 4 mm, slice gap = 0.5 mm, flip angle = 90°, FOV = 22 × 22 cm , number of averages = 1, matrix size = 64 × 64, voxel size = 3.4375 × 3.4375 × 4 mm . A total of 180 volumes were collected, resulting in a total scan time of 6 min. The patients in the AVH group reported that they experienced no hallucinations during scanning, and all participants also reported that they were alert in the scanning session. \n\n\n### Data preprocessing \n  \nData were preprocessed using Data Processing Assistant for Resting‐State fMRI (DPARSF) programs, which are based on Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) and MATLAB (MathWorks). The first five volumes were discarded due to unsteady magnetization. Slice‐timing and realignment were performed. We excluded the subjects whose head motion with translational or rotational motion was higher than 3 mm or 3°, and three patients in the NAVH group were excluded. Then, data were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute template (resampling voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm ), detrended, and filtered (0.01–0.08 Hz). Image volumes with framewise displacement (FD) >0.2 mm were scrubbed to reduce the effect of head motion using spline interpolation (He et al.,  ). In this study, we failed to find significant differences in FD between groups (  F   = 0.302,   p   = .740). Nuisance covariates were regressed, including Friston 24 head motion (Friston et al.,  ) parameters and white matter and cerebrospinal fluid signals). The global signal was not regressed out as has been recently suggested (Yang et al.,  ) when processing functional data from patients with schizophrenia. \n\n\n###  dFCD   estimation and temporal variability \n  \nGlobal, contralateral, and ipsilateral dFCD were computed using a sliding‐window method. The length of the window we set was 50 TRs (He et al.,  ; R. Li et al.,  ), and this window was used to slide on the time course with a step of 1 TR (2 s). In total, 126 (175–50 + 1) temporal windows were produced, then we calculated FCD for each window. We first calculated the global FCD for each window as the mean number of functional connectivity between one voxel (seed) and other voxels (target voxels) in the whole brain. The global FCD was limited voxels within the gray matter template. Functional connectivity between voxels was calculated using Pearson's correlation, with a correlation coefficient threshold of   p   < .05, uncorrected. Then we discomposed the global FCD into contralateral and ipsilateral FCD based on the relative positions of seed and target voxels. Contralateral (interhemispheric) FCD at each voxel referred to the number of functional connectivity with all voxels in the opposite hemisphere, and ipsilateral (intrahemispheric) FCD at each voxel referred to the number of functional connectivity with all voxels in the same hemisphere. To examine the reproducibility of our findings, we repeated our findings with different window lengths (30 TRs and 80 TRs), correlation thresholds (  p   < .01 and   p   < .001) and shifting step (2 TRs) (Figures S ). We employed one common metric to describe its dynamic characteristics in global, contralateral, and ipsilateral dFCD that was the standard deviation of the dFCD variance patterns over time. After that,   Z  ‐transformed dFCD variance maps were obtained and spatially smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian kernel (full width at half maximum [FWHM] = 6 mm). \n\nWhen we set the window length as 175 TRs, global, contralateral, and ipsilateral static FCD (sFCD) was obtained in accordance with FCD analysis for each window. For comparing with dFCD, we also calculated sFCD using Pearson's correlation, with a correlation coefficient threshold of   p   < .05, uncorrected. Finally,   Z  ‐transformed connectivity maps were also obtained and were spatially smoothed (6 mm). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nOne‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA), two‐sample   t   test, and   χ   tests were, respectively, used to compare demographic data between groups with SPSS software. One‐way ANOVA was also performed to compare the group differences in global, contralateral, and ipsilateral dFCD variances and sFCD between the AVH, NAVH, and HC groups, with age, sex and mean FD as covariates. The statistically significant threshold was set at voxel‐wise   p   < .001, cluster‐wise   p   < .05, and the minimum cluster size of 19 voxels after Gaussian random field (GRF) correction. We extracted the average dFCD variance or sFCD values of all voxels within each cluster from corrected statistical maps and performed post hoc comparisons using Bonferroni's test. Moreover, the correlation analysis was performed for clinical measures with significant results between groups. Multiple comparisons were corrected using the Bonferroni method (  p   < .05/92 = .0005). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Demographic and clinical data \n  \nNo significant between‐group differences in age or sex were found, and no significant between‐group differences in PANSS total, positive, negative, or general scores between the AVH and NAVH groups, except for hallucination scores (Table  ). \n\n\n###  dFCD   variance \n  \nThe mean global, contralateral, and ipsilateral dFCD variance maps for the HC, AVH, and NAVH groups were presented in Figure  . DFCD variance patterns in the HC group were maximal in the bilateral superior and middle temporal gyri, medial part of bilateral superior frontal gyri, bilateral middle and inferior occipital gyri, bilateral lingual and fusiform gyri, left IFG, whereas minimal in the right inferior parietal lobe, bilateral subcortical regions (thalamus, caudate, and hippocampus). \n  \nAverage dynamic functional connectivity density (dFCD) variance for healthy controls (HCs) and schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) and without auditory verbal hallucination (NAVH) \n  \nOne‐way ANOVA revealed significant between‐group differences in global dFCD variance in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), left IFG and medial dorsal (MD) nuclei of the bilateral thalami, contralateral dFCD variance in the left MTG, anterior nucleus (AN) of the right thalamus and right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and ipsilateral dFCD variance in the left MTG and left IFG (Table   and Figure  , left). We extracted global, contralateral, and ipsilateral dFCD variance values for each subject in the above regions that had significant between‐group differences and performed one‐way ANOVA followed by post hoc comparisons using Bonferroni's test. Compared with the HC group, the AVH and NAVH groups showed weaker global and ipsilateral dFCD variances in the left MTG and stronger global dFCD variance mainly in the MD nuclei of the bilateral thalami (Figure  , right). Compared with the HC and NAVH groups, the AVH group showed stronger global and ipsilateral dFCD variances in the left IFG, stronger contralateral dFCD variance in the AD of the right thalamus and right ITG and weaker contralateral dFCD variance in the left MTG (Figure  , right). Moreover, compared with the HC group, the NAVH group showed weaker global and ipsilateral dFCD variances in the left IFG (Figure  , right). \n  \nBetween‐group differences in the global, contralateral, and ipsilateral dFCD variances \n      \nBetween‐group differences for global, contralateral and ipsilateral dFCD variances.

However, these significances did not remain after Bonferroni correction (  p   < .05/92 = .0005).

Compared with the HC group, the AVH and NAVH groups showed higher global, contralateral, and ipsilateral sFCD mainly in the MD nuclei of the bilateral thalami (Figure  , lower). Moreover, compared with the HC and NAVH groups, the AVH group showed weaker ipsilateral sFCD in the right IFG (Figure  , lower).

Compared with the NAVH and HC groups, the AVH group showed weaker interhemispheric dFCD variability in the left MTG, as well as stronger interhemispheric dFCD variability in the right ITG and the AN of the right thalamus and stronger intrahemispheric dFCD variability in the left IFG. Both the AVH and NAVH groups showed weaker intrahemispheric dFCD variability in the left MTG than the HC group. Moreover, abnormal contralateral dFCD variance of the left MTG correlated with the severity of auditory hallucinations in the AVH group. These findings help us further understanding the abnormal functional connectivity in AVHs. \n\nOur findings showed some pattern in interhemispheric and intrahemispheric FCD abnormalities in drug‐naïve FES patients with AVHs, which further supported the findings of abnormal local and long‐range connectivity in the previous studies (Chang et al.,  ; C. Chen, Wang, et al.,  ; Hare et al.,  ; Mondino et al.,  ; Zhuo et al.,  ). It suggests the importance to consider the factors of topological location and anatomical distance in future research investigating abnormal brain network in AVHs. Moreover, we explored voxel‐wise interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD variances and sFCD in drug‐naïve FES patients with AVHs. In our previous study, we investigated voxel‐wise resting‐state functional connectivity of the thalamic nucleus in drug‐naïve FES patients with AVHs and found that the critical structure in the thalamus underlying AVHs is the PuM nucleus, and the DM nucleus and AN of the thalamus dysconnectivity are specific for schizophrenia, but not AVHs (Wei et al.,  ). Here, we found abnormal interhemispheric dFCD variance of the thalamic AN in AVHs and abnormal dFCD and sFCD of the bilateral thalamic DM nuclei in drug‐naïve FES patients. Therefore, dynamic functional connection or a combination of static and dynamic functional connectome approaches may provide more evidence for the neural substrate of AVHs. \n\nSimilar to global FCD, contralateral and ipsilateral FCD show interhemispheric and intrahemispheric functional hubs in the neural networks (Guo et al.,  ; Tomasi & Volkow,  ,  ). The AVH group showed abnormal interhemispheric and/or intrahemispheric dFCD variability in the left MTG, left IFG, right ITG, and AN of the right thalamus. The upper regions are the pivotal components of auditory and language pathways (Acheson & Hagoort,  ; Nauchi & Sakai,  ; Opitz et al.,  ; Wahl et al.,  ) and highly associate with the neural mechanism of AVHs (Shergill et al.,  ; Silbersweig et al.,  ; Vercammen et al.,  ; Wei et al.,  ). Abnormal activations and connectivity in auditory and language pathways have highly linked to schizophrenia patients with AVHs (Benetti et al.,  ; Chang et al.,  ; Lavigne & Woodward,  ; Steinmann et al.,  ; Xie et al.,  ). Our findings also indicated that interhemispheric dFCD variance could clearly distinguish the AVH group from the NAVH and HC groups. Moreover, the interhemispheric dFCD variance of the MTG correlated with the AHRS scores and PANSS general symptom scores. Our previous findings indicated aberrant cerebello‐thalamo‐cortical functional and effective connectivity in drug‐naïve FES patients with AVHs, and the cortex also included the MTG and IFG (Wei et al.,  ). A significant deficit in the static interhemispheric and intrahemispheric connectivity in the left MTG was revealed in schizophrenia (Y. Zhang et al.,  ), which is similar to our findings. The previous study also indicated that aberrant bilateral static interhemispheric dysconnectivity of the IFG might contribute to the occurrence of AVHs (Chang et al.,  ). The previous studies utilized the parameter of asymmetry (PAS) (static interhemispheric functional connectivity subtracts static intrahemispheric functional connectivity) to describe functional asymmetry, and reduced PAS scores of the MTG was found in schizophrenia patients and unaffected siblings compared with healthy subjects (F. Zhu et al.,  ). Abnormal activations and connectivity in these regions might be the core neurobiological markers of auditory and language impairments in schizophrenia patients with AVHs (Hashimoto et al.,  ; Hoffman & Hampson,  ; Lavigne & Woodward,  ). From a dynamic perspective, our present findings supplement evidence for the neural mechanism of AVHs and provide sensitive views of the temporal variability changes of functional connection hubs that may be masked in conventional static studies. The previous and present studies consistently demonstrate the important role of the auditory and language pathways associated with the MTG, IFG, and thalamus in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AVHs. \n\nThe findings of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD for AVHs also support hybrid models of AVH (i.e., top‐down and bottom‐up, corollary discharge, nondominant language intrusion, and interhemispheric miscommunication) that was overviewed by Ćurčić‐Blake et al. ( ). Part of our findings might support one of the above‐mentioned models, and another part of our findings might support anther model. First, abnormal interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD of the MTG might correspond to impaired bottom‐up sensory processing (perception deficit) and abnormal interhemispheric dFCD of the thalamus and intrahemispheric dFCD of the IFG might correspond to impaired top‐down prior expectation (attention deficit), which might also suggest the imbalance in top‐down/bottom‐up influences (Hugdahl,  ). Second, abnormal intrahemispheric dFCD of the MTG and IFG might also correspond to impaired corollary discharge. The previous studies showed deficient corollary discharge in schizophrenia patients with AVHs (Ford et al.,  ) and indicated that fronto‐temporal transcranial direct current stimulation improved corollary discharge function in schizophrenia (Bose et al.,  ). Third, our findings also showed abnormal interhemispheric dFCD and intrahemispheric sFCD in nondominant language areas, such as the right ITG and IFG, which was similar to the previous studies (Sommer et al.,  ; van Lutterveld et al.,  ). Finally, our findings directly support interhemispheric miscommunication (Curcic‐Blake et al.,  ; Gavrilescu et al.,  ). Compared with the NAVH and HC groups, the AVH group showed weaker interhemispheric dFCD variability in the left MTG, as well as stronger interhemispheric dFCD variability in the right thalamus and ITG. \n\nWe also investigated abnormal interhemispheric and intrahemispheric sFCD in drug‐naïve FES patients with AVHs. The findings showed higher interhemispheric and intrahemispheric sFCD on the DM nuclei of bilateral thalami in drug‐naïve FES patients with AVHs and NAVH and weaker intrahemispheric sFCD on the right IFG in patients with AVHs. As an important component of aberrant neural circuitry in schizophrenia, the gray matter volume of the DM nucleus of the thalamus is impaired in schizophrenia (Gilbert et al.,  ; Sui et al.,  ), higher functional connection might be a compensatory response to structural impairments. Moreover, the previous studies found reduced PAS scores of the thalamus and IFG was found in schizophrenia patients and ultra‐high risk for psychosis (F. Zhu et al.,  ). However, we found opposite pattern between the whole‐brain and intrahemispheric dFCD variances and sFCD in drug‐naïve FES patients with AVHs or NAVH, which is consistent with the findings in the previous study exploring the neural substrates of other neurological diseases, such as bipolar depression and major depressive disorders (Pang et al.,  ), generalized anxiety disorder (Lu et al.,  ), and Parkinson's disease (S. Wang, Cai, et al.,  ). Higher dFCD may reflect the indicative of flexible communication, but it may also be a sign of unstable interactions (S. Wang, Cai, et al.,  ). And weaker sFCD may be the result of unstable interactions. \n\nSeveral limitations should be noted when interpreting our findings. First, although we designed three groups that included 50 subjects for each group, the sample size is small. The future study should increase the sample size to make the findings more reliable. Second, we showed abnormal interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD in drug‐naïve FES patients with AVHs, but how temporal dynamics of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD develop in other illness stage was unclear. The interhemispheric connectivity between posterior auditory regions may depend on the phase of illness, with increases in nonpsychotic individuals and FES patients and decreases in chronic patients (Ćurčić‐Blake et al.,  ). The future study should explore whether the illness stage affect interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD in AVHs. Third, we collected resting‐state fMRI data, and it remains unknown whether abnormal interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD in AVHs associated with impaired auditory processing. Future task state fMRI studies are needed to examine the association between interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD variability and auditory cognitive function. \n\nIn conclusion, the findings demonstrate that abnormal temporal variability of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric dFCD in drug‐naïve FES patients with AVHs mainly focuses on interhemispheric pattern in temporal cortex and thalamus and intrahemispheric pattern in the frontal cortex, and these regions are pivotal components of auditory and language pathways. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nAll authors declared no conflict of interest. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"83f1c0c6585a6b3a2839636b2fbb7b82"},

However, little is known regarding the dynamic features of the brain network behind these symptoms in DLB. In the present study, the intra- and inter-brain network dynamics were explored on a time scale in 17 DLB and 20 healthy controls (HC) applying a sliding-window method followed by   k  -means clustering analysis. To further evaluate the impact of network dynamics on brain performance, the local and global efficiency of the brain network was calculated. Compared with HC, the dynamic functional connectivity variation matrix in DLB patients was represented by a mixed change of intra-network increase and inter-network decrease. DLB patients devoted more time to a negative connectivity pattern, which represents a state of functional separation. Furthermore, the local efficiency of DLB patients was significantly lower compared with HC. These observations indicate an altered dynamic variability and disorders to the time allocation of state sequences in DLB, which might result in a disturbance of the intricate brain network dynamic properties, thereby leading to a lack of integration and flexibility and an ineffective brain function. In conclusion, dynamic functional connectivity analysis could identify differences between DLB and HC, providing evidences for DLB diagnosis and contributing to the understanding of the widespread clinical features and complex treatment strategies in DLB patients. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a growing concern worldwide, accounting for up to 15% of dementia cases ( ). It is characterized by four core clinical features: fluctuating cognition, recurrent visual hallucinations, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and spontaneous parkinsonism ( ). Multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies revealed that the dysfunction of several brain connection networks is pertinent to the impairments in DLB. Fluctuating cognition and recurrent hallucinations, indicating transient abnormal brain functions, suggest that the connection disorders among brain's intrinsic networks may be dynamic. Studies on DLB, especially regarding fluctuation and recurrence, should focus more on the dynamic brain network properties enabled by time courses for a better understanding of its characteristics. \n\nRecently, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has become of increasing popularity in the exploration of the pathophysiological DLB mechanism employing various means. For instance, some studies delineated local functional connectivity (FC) patterns using seed region analysis, and found that the connectivity of default mode network (DMN), frontal-parietal network (FPN), sensorimotor network (SMN)-related brain regions ( ,  ), and visual network (VIS) ( ) of DLB were disrupted. In addition, functional brain network analysis based on independent component analysis (ICA) technique highlighted some disconnections within and between specific resting-state networks (RSNs), including DMN ( ), SMN ( ), and FPN ( ), and the correlation between some connections and the frequency and severity of cognitive fluctuations. Furthermore, Peraza et al. ( ) revealed altered network connectivity accompanied with frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes lower clustering coefficient in DLB patients by the graph theory, quantifying abnormal network characteristics. Generally, these findings provide an evidence regarding differences in functional brain network connectivity between DLB individuals and Parkinson's disease dementia or Alzheimer's disease, implying that the alterations in brain network organization play a potentially important role in comprehending the etiology of the core symptoms in DLB. \n\nNevertheless, static correlation between intra- and inter-networks is based only on the hypothesis that FC activity among different brain areas remains constant throughout the whole scanning process and the conventional methods mentioned above use static correlation ( ,  ). However, several findings reported that the FC of human brain is not invariable ( ,  ), showing a certain dynamic as time goes on, regardless of whether it is in the task state or under anesthesia ( ). Since DLB is characterized by fluctuant and recurrent clinical symptoms, static functional measures cannot completely reflect the dynamic neural activity; thus, these traditional methods have recently faced challenges ( ,  ). Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) brain network analysis using the sliding-window method has been used to evaluate the relevant FC variations directly by dividing the whole scanning time series into many segments of the same size and observe the evolution of FC over time. This method offers a promising way for assessing the dynamic temporal organization of the resting state brain activity and brings fresh insights into the brain network fluctuation caused by brain disorders. Therefore, a great number of neuropsychiatric studies on major depressive disorder ( ), schizophrenia ( ,  ), epilepsy ( ), and mild cognitive impairment ( ), have been carried out. Despite the fact that DFC measurements have been increasingly used to investigate the way the brain is affected by the disease, neuroimaging investigations of DFC in DLB patients remain scarce. A recent work ( ) applied the Product Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to compare the DFC changes between DLB and healthy participants, and a set of visual-related RSNs and FPN have been identified. However, this work mainly focused on the Product HMM from a modeling perspective, and less attention was paid on exploring the pathological mechanism of this disease. Thus, further investigations are needed to reveal the DFC characteristics of DLB, to deepen our knowledge in the underlying etiology, therefore providing important clues on the potential biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and treatment. \n\nHence, in the present study, sliding-window DFC analysis and exploratory   k  -means clustering technique were employed to systematically evaluate FC pattern dynamics in DLB patients. Our aim was to evaluate if the variability of DFC in DLB was significantly changed compared with HC both intra- and inter-network. In addition, a further aim considering the cognitive impairment was to evaluate if the temporal distribution among states of DLB subjects was aberrant, showing a less flexible state transition. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants and Assessment \n  \nA total of 17 DLB patients (mean age, 71.88 ± 5.69 years; range, 60–82 years; 13 male) and 20 healthy subjects (mean age, 67.80 ± 7.19 years; range, 56–77 years; 9 male) as controls were recruited from the Affiliated Brain Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from May 2015 to February 2019. HCs were selected by matching patients in gender and age. Clinical diagnosis was performed by two independent neurology experts, using McKeith's criteria for probable DLB ( ). All patients suffered from two or more core DLB symptoms. Motor symptoms were evaluated by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Part III (UPDRS-III) and the severity of disease was obtained by the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) score. All participants underwent cognitive condition assessments by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Subjects who had MRI contraindications, a history of focal brain lesions, other neurological or psychiatric diseases, and severe medical illness were excluded from both groups. The study was approved by the Human Participants Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Brain Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, China, and each subject enrolled in this study provided written informed consent. \n\n\n### Image Acquisition \n  \nAll MRI scans were obtained from a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner (Siemens, Verio, Germany) at the Department of Radiology of the Affiliated Brain Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China. Resting-state functional images were collected by an 8-channel head coil and a gradient-echo T2-weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence according to the following parameters: resolution = 3 × 3 × 3 mm ; time points = 140; repetition time (TR) = 2,000 ms; echo time (TE) = 30 ms; field of view (FOV) = 240 × 240 mm; flip angle = 90°; matrix = 64 × 64; slice number = 30; thickness = 3 mm; slice gap = 0 mm. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired using three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo (3D FSPGR) sequence in a sagittal orientation for each subject (resolution = 1 × 1 × 1 mm ; TR = 2530 ms; TE = 3.34 ms; flip angle = 7°; slice number = 128; thickness = 1.33 mm; slice gap = 0 mm; matrix = 256 × 256). During the scanning, participants were explicitly instructed to be relaxed, to close their eyes, to not think of anything, and to remain still and awake (confirmed by all subjects immediately after the scanning). Additionally, the head of all participants was fixed and earplugs were used in order to reduce the impact of head motion and noise. \n\n\n### Data Processing \n  \nImage preprocessing was performed using Data Processing & Analysis for (Resting-State) Brain Imaging (DPABI Version 2.3  ) implemented in MATLAB 2014a (MathWorks, Natick, MA). The preprocessing steps were as follows: reduction of the first 10 volumes of each rest session, slice timing, realignment to the middle image for head motion correction, registration to mean functional image; spatial normalization (3 × 3 × 3 mm ) to standard space (Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI) using Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL); segmentation of anatomical images into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); removal of the WM signals, CSF signals, and Friston 24-parameter; smooth with 6 mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) kernel, regressing out linear and quadratic trends and band-pass filter (0.01–0.08 Hz). This preprocessing order was in accordance with the standard protocol as described in Yan et al. ( ). Subjects with head motion >2.0° and 2 mm were excluded. \n\n\n### ROI Generation and Definition of Functional Brain Networks \n  \nThe complexity of time-varying DFC represents the main difference from static FC and the recruitment of more areas in the relevant networks could offer more comprehensive information. As shown in a previous study ( ), after preprocessing, the 264 spherical regions of interest (ROIs) with a diameter of 5 mm were defined around coordinates defined by Power et al. ( ). Then, the mean time courses of the 264 ROIs were extracted. According to previous studies, these functional regions form 13 brain networks, including DMN, SMN, cingulo-opercular network (CON), auditory network, VIS, memory retrieval, FPN, salience network (SAN), subcortical network (SC), ventral attention network (VAN), dorsal attention network (DAN), cerebellum network, and uncertain networks. This definition of brain network facilitates the study of FC within and between networks. Since the function of the “Uncertain” network is not specific, we mainly paid attention to the other 12 brain networks consisting of 236 seed sites. \n\n\n### Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity Construction \n  \nThe 236 available ROIs were used to analyze DFC using DynamicBC toolbox ( ). Since there was no formal consensus on window length, dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) was constructed using the sliding-window Pearson's correlation method with a length of 20 TRs (40 s) and a step size of 1TR, as previously performed ( ), resulting in 111 windows. In each window, we computed Pearson correlation coefficients between the time series of each pair of the 236 ROIs. As a result, we obtained a 236 × 236 matrix of Pearson correlation coefficients between any pair of ROIs to construct the brain network FC matrix for each window. Then, Fisher's   r  -to-  z   transformation was used to transform the unweighted individual correlation matrices into   z  -score matrices without thresholding, so as to improve normality. These Fisher's   z  -transformed correlation matrices were used to further calculate the variation of DFC. The static functional network connectivity was also calculated based on the whole time series. \n\n\n### Functional Connectivity Variation \n  \nTo characterize dynamics variability, the dynamic functional connectivity variation (dFCV) matrix was subsequently evaluated as the standard deviation of the Fisher's   z  -transformed Pearson's correlation coefficients across all of the windows for each participant. In this method, DFC stability could be quantitatively estimated and compared between different groups. The original FCV matrices were then Fisher   z  -transformed and were statistically compared. \n\n\n###  k  -means Clustering \n  \nTo identify dFNC patterns reoccurring across temporal matrices,   k  -means clustering was employed on all the dynamic correlation matrices to divide the dFNC into discrete clusters. The   k  -means algorithm aggregates information with similarities into “  k  ” groups, ensuring that the sum of squares within clusters is minimal. During the clustering estimation, the correlation distance metric was chosen because it is more sensitive to the dFNC pattern, regardless of magnitude ( ). Cluster analysis of a series of   k   values ranging from 2 to 10 was then performed based on all subjects. To obtain the optimal number of cluster centroids, we used the silhouette values, Calinski–Harabasz values and Davies–Bouldin values. The evaluation results showed that (silhouette) optimal   k   = 2, (Calinski–Harabasz) optimal   k   = 2, (Davies Bouldin) optimal   k   = 2, and (mean) optimal   k   = 2, where (mean) optimal   k   = 2 is the value obtained by rounding the first three ( ,  ,  ) simple average backwards. Finally, we gave the result of optimal   k   = 2. For each available cluster, a cluster centroid was generated, representing the FC for this cluster capturing all features. Therefore, two most frequent states of DFC were identified and further statistical analysis was carried out between patients and HC. \n\n\n### State Analysis \n  \nThe temporal indexes derived from each participant's transition state vector, which represents the change of state assignments over time, were explored. More specifically, we focus on three main measures of each subject, including (a) mean dwell time of each state, which refers to the average number of consecutive windows belonging to one state before changing to the other state; (b) frequency of each state, which refers to the number of windows per state; and (c) total number of transitions, which refers to the total number of conditions that the clustering state convert from one to another. \n\n\n### Topological Properties of Static Functional Connectivity \n  \nTo better understand the disease effects on the resting state fMRI, graph metrics for the static connectivity were also computed. Individual correlation matrices were converted into binarized matrices according to a predefined sparsity threshold (0.01–0.50, with an increment of 0.01). Network sparsity, defined as the fraction of the total number of existing edges divided by the maximum possible number of edges, was used to enable all networks to have the same number of edges. This threshold selection was based on the criteria proposed by previous studies ( ,  ), which could assure that the thresholded networks were estimable for small-worldness and had sparse properties with as few spurious edges as possible. Global efficiency and local efficiency, which are two key topological properties, were employed using the graph theoretical network analysis toolbox. Global efficiency computed the average inverse shortest path length of all network nodes, as a measure of global integration, quantifying the parallel information transfer ( ). Local efficiency estimated the information exchange capability of subnetwork, as an assessment of local connection efficiency, measuring the fault tolerance of networks ( ). Since each correlation matrix was thresholded repeatedly over a wide range of sparsity, the area under the curve (AUC) for each network metric was computed to be taken as a summarized scalar for the topological characterization of the brain networks. The statistical analysis was performed between DLB and HC subjects to compare the static network features. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nThe Fisher   z  -transformed FCV matrices were compared between patients and HC using two-sample   t  -test using the graph theoretical network analysis toolbox (  p   < 0.005). Analyses were performed using age and sex as covariates. Since data distribution was not normal, non-parametric Mann–Whitney test was used to compare the dwell time of each state, frequency of each state and total number of transitions between patients and controls using a threshold of   p   < 0.05. Besides, statistical analysis to evaluate local efficiency, global efficiency, age and clinical assessment was conducted using two sample   t  -test, while statistical analysis to evaluate significant differences in the number of males and females between the two groups was conducted applying the Chi-square test. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and Clinical Information of the Subjects \n  \nDemographic and clinical information of the participants is summarized in  . No significant differences were found in gender and age between patients and HC.

All changes in the DLB group indicated that most of the increased DFC variations are located within the networks (DMN, SMN, VIS, FPN, SA, SC, and DA), and few intra-network FCV showed a decrease within the DMN and SC. Inter-network changes were characterized by decreased DFC variations, especially between several subnetwork pairs related to DMN, VIS, and FPN, and between SMN and FPN. Besides, some subnetwork regions exhibited mixed changes including both increase and decrease. \n  \nDynamic functional network connectivity characteristics.

Thus, two representative states were identified for all obtained sliding windows from the clustering analysis and the centroids of the two dFNC states, indicating the median of all subjects for each state, as shown in  . The percentages located at the top of each centroid represent the occurrence of each state to total time series. In state 1, the whole network displayed slight negative connectivity, and slight positive connectivity intra-networks. State 2 showed moderate positive connectivity within and between most inter-networks, while the connectivity was negative between DMN and others. Additionally, based on the   k  -means algorithm results, the dwell time and frequency of each state and the total number of transitions were characterized, and the relevant indexes of connectivity states are shown in   ( ). Inter-group differences observed in the dwell time revealed that the average dwell time of state 2 in the DLB group was significantly shortened compared with normal volunteers (  p   = 0.040). Although no significant difference in dwell time of state 1 or total transition times between the two groups was found, the DLB patients showed an increasing trend in state 1 dwell time and a decreasing trend in the total transition time. \n  \nCentroids of the two dFNC states.

Our observations primarily demonstrated that the dFCV matrix of the DLB group presented a mixed change characteristic. Specifically, DLB patients displayed increased intra-network variability mainly involving DMN, SMN, VIS, FPN, and decreased dFCV between DMN, VIS, FPN, and between SMN and FPN. Subsequently,   k  -means algorithm identified two representative states among all subjects, and the dwell time of state 2 in DLB group was significantly decreased compared to healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the evidence provided by the supplementary graph theory analysis showed that the topological property of DLB was affected with lower local efficiency when compared with healthy volunteers. These findings suggest that the DLB group was characterized by a widely aberrant dFCV and altered functional connection patterns, thus offering a new perspective and ideas in understanding DLB. \n\n### Distribution of dFCV Changes in DLB Patients \n  \nEvidence was found regarding some pathophysiological activities of nerve cells associated with the changes of FC. These findings could reflect the intrinsic mechanism under different conditions. The dFCV of DLB patients increased within networks and decreased between networks compared with the normal control group, the former group showing different profiles of intra- and inter-networks. The intra- and inter-network variability characterizes the alterations with time of functional connectivity within and between brain networks. Generally speaking, less fluctuation of variability suggests a higher correlation of function construction among all sliding windows, signifying a lack of flexibility to change. Significant fluctuation of variability implies that the function construction is poorly correlated among different sliding windows, indicating an unstable state ( ). Dramatic increase or decrease in dFCV may be associated with potentially pathological neuropsychiatric activities related to cognitive activities ( ,  ), mental activities ( ,  ), and sensorimotor activities ( ). Our results indicated a significantly higher instability within network connectivity and significant lower flexibility between network connectivity in DLB patients, which reflects distinct patterns of functional intra- and inter-network damage, deepening our understanding on the pathological mechanism of DLB. \n\nNormally, each network module is equipped with specific functions, and the functional connection between network modules can be understood as the organic integration of different functions. Any abnormal function of either within and between brain network will affect the normal execution of specific functions undertaken by brain networks, leading to clinical symptoms in DLB patients. The increase of dynamic FCV within DMN, SMN, VIS, and FPN in the DLB group implies that the connection state is aberrant and more unstable. DMN is related to cognitive processing including episodic memory and making plans ( ). VIS is associated to visual perception ( ) and visual-constructive processing ( ). FPN is responsible for the execution control of attention ( ,  ). Since DLB individuals complain mainly about attention ( ), motor ( ), and visual ( ) impairments and these dysfunctions are roughly consistent with the functions of DMN, SMN, VIS, and FPN, respectively, we therefore speculate that the occurrence of these symptoms could be related to the functional instability of the networks mentioned above. Besides, these abnormal networks and the brain regions involved were also reported in previous imaging studies of DLB. Metabolism ( ) and perfusion ( ,  ) studies found a decrease of neural activities in the frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex areas. A large number of fMRI studies reported a disrupted functional connectivity of DMN ( ,  ), SMN ( ), VIS ( ), and FPN ( ,  ) in DLB patients. These studies further support the reliability of our findings. Therefore, we have reason to believe that these unstable intra-network connections could provide a theoretical support for transient clinical features such as spontaneous fluctuation in attention, cognition, and recurrent visual hallucinations in DLB patients. \n\nFrom the perspective of interconnection, large-scale brain network pairs with a lower variability, encompassing DMN, VIS, FPN and SMN, cannot be flexibly integrated, which may be related to the poor cognitive, motor, visual, sleep, and emotional impairments in DLB patients in general, resulting in a complex treatment strategy and no ideal therapeutic effect. Furthermore, previous works have been carried out to illustrate the neural basis of DLB, with substantial evidence suggesting widespread WM lesions ( ,  ) and structural atrophy ( ). Besides, a previous work indicated inconsistent regional homogeneity of neural activities ( ) and an abnormal graph model of information communication between distant and close brain regions in DLB participants ( ). A large number of structural damage and functional changes may be the neural basis of dysfunctional dynamics of intra- and inter-network connectivity in DLB. Taken together, these inter-group differences within and between networks consistent with clinical impairments suggest that the temporal dynamic characteristics of brain networks could reflect DLB dysfunction-related neural phenomena. \n\n\n### Clustering Indexes Alterations in DLB Participants \n  \nDFC study covering the whole brain in non-task state ( ) revealed that the human brain is in a dynamic transition process between diverse FCs, which are characterized by different connectivity patterns ( ) (commonly referred to as “state”). The dynamic change of FC underlined that the organization reconstruction takes place constantly, creating highly flexible and adaptable systems without fundamentally structural alteration ( ,  ) and some recurring patterns can be finally identified ( ). These patterns may undergo changes with internal external drivers, ranging from physiology ( ,  ) to pathology. For instance, with the development of DLB, the frequency, duration, and flexible switching between distinct states may be affected in the patient group. \n\nIn the current study, we captured the inter-group differences in the dwell time of state 2. The results showed a significantly fewer state 2 average dwell time in the DLB group, together with a trend of lower frequency. In addition, we provided evidence that the DLB group had the tendency of longer dwell time and higher occurrence frequency of state 1. In state 2, almost all intra-networks and most inter-networks displayed moderate positive connectivity, while DMN displayed a negative connectivity pattern between networks. This connectivity pattern may signify that the subjects are on the alert to gather information from their surroundings ( ). In state 1, the whole network displayed a slight negative connectivity, with slight positive connectivity located within networks. This pattern may mean that the participants reduced the focus on the outside and are in a resting state ( ). DLB individuals allocate less time to a state of positive connectivity and devote more time to negative connectivity pattern than controls, which might suggest that brain network connectivity of the DLB tends to be segregated, while the brain network connectivity of the control might prefer to be integrated during resting state. This may be relevant to the presence of cognitive decline in general. \n\nState conversions could be the foundation of segregation and integration between different brain networks/subnetworks or specific functional resources such as cognitive ( ,  ) and mental activities ( ). As expected, DLB individuals switched less frequently, which might indicate less response to the surrounding information and might result in a slow thinking and intermittent confusion, which are typical DLB features. Overall, the observed slowing and disturbance of state dynamics in DLB suggest that the brain of DLB patients might be in a less flexible and ineffective functional state. \n\n\n### Topological Characteristics of Resting Brain Network \n  \nDFC measures brain network properties well from a temporal perspective. In order to comprehensively depict brain network characteristics, we further complementarily analyzed the brain network properties of spatial topology and found that the local efficiency of the DLB group was significantly lower than that of healthy controls. Local efficiency is an assessment of local information exchange, measuring the fault tolerance of networks. This supplementary analysis proved from another point of view that DLB patients had abnormal network function. Time-based DFC analysis revealed a loss of brain network flexibility in DLB patients. From the perspective of space, we found that the local fault tolerance in DLB patients was reduced. Reduced fault tolerance means that the brain is less able to withstand failure and recover from failure, which might be associated with DLB's abnormally rigid brain networks, thus leading to the cognitive slowing. Interestingly, we found that the global efficacy of DLB is normal, suggesting that these patients only had abnormal local indicators while global indicators were not affected, which may be related to functional compensation driven from mixed changed within and between networks in respect of dynamic FCV. \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nSeveral limitations of our study should be considered. First, our sample size was relatively small and the statistical effect was consequently reduced, resulting in imaging results not passing multiple comparative corrections. Nevertheless, efforts are currently made to recruit more subjects, meaning that a larger sample size will be used in our further study to prove the validity of these findings. Second, DLB patients in our study received medication and the potential impact of drugs on nervous activity is difficult to be removed. However, dopaminergic drugs have been proved to normalize brain functional connections ( ), implying that the statistical differences between groups are not drug-related. Besides, a previous work reported that the administration of memantine resulted in an increased FC in Alzheimer's disease subjects ( ), but this drug was not administered to any of the DLB patients in our cohort. In addition, there are a variety of analytical approaches for calculating matrices and make inference on their significance. Based on this, we used the commonly accepted methods, including using Fisher   z   transformation to improve the normality and calculation of the AUC of each network metric as the sum scalar of the topological characteristics of brain network to prove the reliability of the results. Even if some output results could not be fully explained, a data-driven model based on extracting time series of brain networks for each DLB subject could be considered as a promising research method for describing the dynamics of resting state networks. The development of image analysis and the combination of multimodal techniques may be more helpful to reveal the disease characteristics accurately and comprehensively. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur exploratory experiments combining sliding-window and clustering methods analyzed the dynamics of functional network connectivity. In this work an increased intra-network variability and decreased inter-network in DLB was reported, clearly distinguishing DLB from HC and which might be associated with transient clinical features such as fluctuating cognition and recurrent visual hallucinations. Disturbances to the time allocation of state sequences and a less dynamic brain in DLB lead to a loss of integration and flexibility of the brain network, which might be related to symptoms such as slow thinking and intermittent confusion. Aberrant brain network dynamics of DLB could be considered as a neuroimaging marker of various clinical manifestations. The current study proves the power of the dynamic neuroscience method in the exploration of brain network activity of neurodegenerative diseases and deepens our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in DLB. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Human Participants Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Brain Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, China.

Statistical comparisons and correlation analysis were carried out for static and dynamic FC separately before combining both cases. We found decreased local efficiency (LE) and weighted degree (WD) in cerebellum from both static and dynamic graph attributes. For static FC alone, we identified increased betweenness centrality (BC) at left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left Cerebellum_Crus9 and decreased WD at Vermis_6. For dynamic FC alone, decreased BC, clustering coefficients and LE at several cortical regions and cerebellum were identified. All the features had significant correlation with total UMSARS scores. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that dynamic features had the highest area under the curve value. Our work not only added new evidence for the underlying neurobiology and disrupted dynamic disconnection syndrome of MSA, but also proved the possibility of disease diagnosis and progression tracking using rs-fMRI. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nMultiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder manifested by parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia syndrome, as well as autonomic nervous dysfunction [ ]. Pathologically, it is characterized by alpha synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs), which lead to the degeneration and death of neurons, finally result in the brain atrophy in several specific regions including the striatum, cerebellum, and olivopontine structures [ – ]. However, the mechanism of MSA remains unclear at present. The main hypothesis of MSA pathophysiology suggested that the disruption of functional connectivity (FC) among specific brain regions, caused by alpha synuclein-positive GCI, might contribute to the clinical performances of MSA. \n\nRecent advances in neuroimaging techniques provide the opportunity to study the disconnections (i.e., disruption of functional connectivity) in MSA in vivo. The resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) can explore statistical correlations of spontaneous activities among functional correlated brain regions and different brain networks [ ,  ]. In the previous studies, researchers found the disruption of the striatal-thalamo-cortical (STC) network, default mode network (DMN), visual associated network [ ], cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) network [ ], as well as motor network [ ] in MSA patients, which were associated with the movement dysfunction. Furthermore, recent MSA studies revealed the altered functional connectivity of DMN, sensorimotor network, visual associated cortices and cerebellum [ ,  ], which showed close correlation with structure atrophy and perfusion dysfunction. These studies provided evidence for the hypothesis of “disconnection syndrome”, suggesting that the accumulation of alpha-synuclein GCIs of the MSA may destroy the specific networks and finally result in associated clinical dysfunction [ ]. Besides resting state networks, graph theoretical analysis is another method to study brain networks. Researchers found altered network topology and graph theory attributes by diffusion tensor tractography [ ] and rs-fMRI [ ,  ]. Despite these advances, previous studies mostly assumed that the functional connectivity was constant during the MRI scanning, ignoring its dynamic nature [ – ]. \n\nCompared to static FC, dynamic FC offers the chance to investigate the rs-fMRI time series on a much finer scale (e.g., at specific time points or within predefined time windows), which brings two exclusive advantages. On the one hand, it facilitates observation of details that are averaged out in static FC and thus offers richer information for studying brain activities. On the other hand, it enables capture of spontaneously reoccurring functional connectivity patterns (i.e., FC states), which is essential for understanding the temporal variability in the intrinsic organization of the brain. Based on these advantages, researchers found that dynamic FC was a potential sensitive biomarker for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Schizophrenia [ ], Autism [ ], and Parkinson's disease [ ,  ]. The graph theory attributes are extended based on dynamic FC as well [ ,  ]. However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the dynamic FC in MSA patients until now. To fill in the gap, this paper intends to combine the static and dynamic FC to focus on the following two questions: 1) whether and how MSA patients differ from healthy controls (HCs) in the static and dynamic FC at the whole-brain level; 2) whether such differences in static and dynamic FC can serve as potential biomarkers of MSA. Based on the previous studies and the pathology of MSA, we can hypothesize that alpha synuclein-positive GCI may disrupt the connectivity of DMN regions, sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum, destroy the network topology pattern in these regions, which are associated with clinical dysfunction. By using static and dynamic FC analysis, we can deeply understand the differences between MSA and controls, and possibly capture the most sensitive biomarker to differentiate the two groups. \n\nIn the current study, we propose a novel joint analysis method, investigating the network topology of static and dynamic FC based on the resting-state fMRI data of 24 MSA patients and 20 HCs. Firstly, we calculated four graph theory attributes based on static and dynamic FC. Secondly, statistical comparisons were performed and the correlations between features and clinical performance were measured in static and dynamic cases independently. Then, we identified features that are significantly abnormal and correlated with clinical scores in both static and dynamic cases, as well as static specific and dynamic specific features. Finally, we used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to investigate whether the significantly different and correlated features can serve as predictors to distinguish MSA from HC. \n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Demographic and neuropsychological tests \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics are described in  . No significant differences of gender, age, education, MMSE and MoCA scores were found between the MSA-c type and control groups. However, the MSA-c type group exhibited increased total UMSARS scores which refer to the severity of the disease. \n   Clinical and demographical data.    \n\n### Graph attributes analysis \n  \nStatistical analysis on graph attributes identified a range of significantly different and correlated regions. A region is considered as significantly different if the non-parametric Mann Whitney test produced a p-value < 0.05. The correlation analysis between four graph theory attributes and total UMSARS scores selects regions that showed a p-value less than 0.05 in Kendall correlations. We identified regions and features that were significant (difference and correlation) in static-alone, dynamic-alone and both scenarios.

Patients showed increased BC values and decreased LE and WD values at these regions Cerebellum_Crus. The correlations of BC with scores were all positive, whereas CCFS, LE and WD were negatively correlated with scores ( ). \n\nFor dynamic feature results, BC at left frontal eye field (BA8), CCFS at right VACC, LE at right Cerebellum_Crus1 (AR92), right Cerebellum_Crus2, right Cerebellum_Crus6 and Vermis_6, WD at right Cerebellum_Crus6 were both significantly different and correlated with scores. Patients showed reduced CCFS, LE and WD values at these regions, while with decreased BC at left frontal eye field. The correlations of BC with scores were positive, whereas CCFS, LE and WD were negatively correlated with scores ( ). \n\nThe stability of dynamic graph attributes was also examined. The stability of patients was higher than healthy controls in several regions for LE and WD, while healthy controls were more stable for CCFS. The betweenness centrality (BC), however, exhibited mixed result. Only BC at left frontal eye field was both significantly different in strength (p<0.005) and stability (p<0.004), as well as correlated with scores (Kendall taur = 0.333). BC of AD patients at left frontal eye field was more stable than healthy controls. The detailed statistics can be found in  \n\n\n### Static and dynamic overlapping graph attributes \n  \nThe intersection of static and dynamic significant features were LE at right Cerebellum_Crus2, right Cerebellum_Crus6 and Vermis_6, and WD at right Cerebellum_Crus6. As reported before, statistical tests results were consistent in static and dynamic FC. Patients showed reduced LE and WD values at these regions. The correlations of CCFS, LE and WD with scores were negative. \n\nIn order to visualize dynamic graph attributes, we calculated the average and 95% confidence interval within each group at each time slice. Patients and healthy controls were shown as red and green respectively. The average value lies in the middle, bounded by the upper and lower 95% confidence interval curves.

The dynamic significant feature of LE at right Cerebellum_Crus2 reached the highest ROC AUC of 0.78, followed by dynamic significant feature of LE at right Cerebellum_Crus6 with ROC AUC of 0.75. \n\n\n### Static and dynamic specific graph attributes \n  \nIn order to investigate differences of static and dynamic graph attributes, we identified features that are significant only in static or dynamic cases. The static specific significant features include BC at left DLPFC, left Cerebellum_Crus9 and WD at Vermis_6, while dynamic specific significant features include BC at left frontal eye field, CCFS at right VACC, and LE at Cerebellum_Crus1. Patients had higher static BC at left DLPFC and left Cerebellum_Crus9, and lower static WD at Vermis_6. Static BC at left DLPFC and left Cerebellum_Crus9 were positively correlated with scores while static WD at Vermis_6 showed negative correlation. All dynamic specific significant features were lower in the patient group and had negative correlation except BC at left frontal eye field.

Our main findings are as follows. First, among the features identified from both static and dynamic graph attributes, LE at right Cerebellum_Crus2, right Cerebellum_Crus6 and Vermis_6, and WD at right Cerebellum_Crus6 had significant correlations with total UMSARS scores. Second, when investigating the differences between static and dynamic graph attributes, we identified features that are significantly abnormal only in static or dynamic cases. The static specific significant features include BC at left DLPFC, left Cerebellum_Crus9 and WD at Vermis_6, while dynamic specific significant features include BC at left frontal eye field, CCFS at right VACC, and LE at right Cerebellum_Crus1. All the features had significant correlation with total UMSARS scores. Third, the ROC analysis revealed that among all static and dynamic features, dynamic specific CCFS at right VACC showed the largest area under the curve, implying that the dynamic functional change of VACC may be the key imaging marker for MSA diagnosis. \n\n\n### Features identified from both static and dynamic graph attributes \n  \nAmong the features identified from both static and dynamic graph attributes, some features were found to have significant correlations with total UMSARS scores in several cerebellar subregions. BC, CCFS, LE and WD are measures of regional functional “importance” based on the strength of a region’s connections with other regions and importance of the connected brain regions themselves. In our study, we found LE and WD in MSA patients were lower than healthy controls in the identified areas and showed mostly negative correlation. The decreased LE at right Cerebellum_Crus2, right Cerebellum_Crus6 and Vermis_6, and WD at right Cerebellum_Crus6 suggested that the accumulation of alpha-synuclein GCIs of the MSA may destroy specific networks including the DMN and cerebellum networks [ ,  ]. \n\nApart from the overlapping significant graph attributes in both static and dynamic, there are several static and dynamic specific graph attributes. The static specific significant features include increased BC at left DLPFC and left Cerebellum_Crus9, decreased WD at vermis_6, while dynamic specific significant features include decreased BC at left frontal eye field, decreased CCFS at right VACC, and decreased LE at right Cerebellum_Crus1. This discrepancy between static and dynamic graph attributes indicates that dynamic functional connectivity can reveal extra significant features. As ROC analysis reported below, some features showed a strong predictive value only in dynamic cases. \n\nWe also identified BC at left frontal eye field as the only feature that showed difference on dynamic stability and strength, as well as correlated with scores. Stability measures the amount of changes of a feature during a period of time [ ]. BC at left frontal eye field in patients was more stable than healthy controls, meaning that the brain network's topology related to left frontal eye field of patients did not change as much as healthy controls. This network stiffness may be caused by MSA. The occurrence of BC at left frontal eye field in the set of significant difference and significant correlation dynamic features also implies the link of dynamic functional alteration, dynamic stability and clinical traits of MSA patients at left frontal eye field. \n\nAs the essential component of DMN, VACC was found to have lower CCFS in MSA patients than healthy controls. The DMN was a functional-anatomic network which is thought to be responsible for self-reflection, memory and stream-of-consciousness processing [ ,  ]. The disruption of DMN was consistently demonstrated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by many resting-state fMRI studies, which contributed to the memory deficit of AD [ ,  ]. However, with the gradually deeper understanding of DMN, researchers found that changes of DMN occurred in several other neurological disorders, including depression [ ], autism spectrum disorders [ ], schizophrenia [ ], as well as in MSA [ ]. These findings indicated that regions of DMN might be responsible for multiple functions beyond memory, including action, cognition, emotion, perception, interception and mental imaginary. Therefore, the disruption of DMN in the MSA-c type may result in the impairment of these functions. This result was consistent with the previous MSA studies, which also reported the disruption of DMN in the MSA-c type patients [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nThe decreased LE at right Cerebellum_Crus1, right Cerebellum_Crus2, right Cerebellum_Crus6 and Vermis_6, WD at Vermis_6 and right Cerebellum_Crus6 were found in our study. To our knowledge, as the afferent fibers of cerebellum, cerebello-cortical circuit mainly comes from the opposite cerebellopontine nucleus and the inferior olivary nucleus, passing through the middle and lower cerebellar peduncles to the new cerebellum. And then, the cerebellar cortex sends the efferent fibers to dentate nuclei and forms the main body of the superior cerebellar peduncles, which project into the contralateral thalamus and cerebral cortex. From the view of the process of the cerebello-cortical circuit, many cerebellum regions play an important role in the network, which is responsible for the planning, balance, and coordination of motor functions. In this study, the disconnection within several cerebellum regions was consistent with the pathology of MSA-c type, which emphasizes on the cerebellum atrophy and dysfunction [ ,  ]. In addition, these results matched well with several previous resting-state fMRI studies [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nIn the present study, we found that BC in MSA patients was higher than healthy controls at left DLPFC and left Cerebellum_Crus9. We speculate that this strange result may be related to its compensatory effect. In addition, we found BC in MSA patients was lower than healthy controls in left frontal eye field, which is a part of the visual network. According to the established international diagnostic criteria of probable MSA defined by the American Academy of Neurology and American Autonomic Society [ ], patients with MSA often show damage of visuospatial function. In addition, Kawai’s study [ ] reported that patients with MSA showed severe involvement of visuospatial and constructional function compared with control subjects. \n\n\n### The dynamic graph attributes analysis of ventral anterior cingulate cortex as biomarker \n  \nIn the previous studies, most researchers used structural changes as biomarker to differentiate the MSA-c type and controls. For example, a previous study used the “hot cross bun” sign as biomarker to diagnose MSA-c type, yielding a high specificity of 97%, but its sensitivity was only 50% [ ]. In the current study, to get a valuable imaging marker, we performed ROC analysis on all features identified from both static and dynamic graph attributes, finding that most of the dynamic significant features show higher AUC values than static significant features. When using the feature of CCFS at right VACC in dynamic graph attributes as the biomarker, we could differentiate the two groups at the cutoff value of 0.503, yielding a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 75.0%, and reach the highest AUC of 0.86. This is a meaningful result which could be used as a valuable imaging marker for the early diagnosis of MSA-c type. \n\n\n### The correlation between graph attributes and clinical performances \n  \nIn this study, we found a close relationship between motor impairment (total UMSARS scores) and the static and dynamic graph attributes in several regions of the MSA patients, which suggested a clinical relevance of static and dynamic functional disruption in MSA. The altered static and dynamic FC in these regions might be used as imaging markers for tracking disease progression. \n\n\n### Dynamic versus static graph attributes \n  \nIn our work, we analyzed dynamic graph attributes based on dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) and incorporated static graph theory attributes to identify significant regions. To our knowledge, no study has examined DFC in MSA patients before. Compared with static functional connectivity, DFC measures functional variation within a time slice of the scanning session and can reveal transient characteristics of brain activities that might be averaged out in static FC. We adopted a sliding-window approach with window length = 100 TR and step size = 3 TR. Our previous research proved that this combination can extract as much features while minimizing computation costs [ ]. It is, however, an open question regarding the selection of sliding-window parameters and other methods to estimate dynamic functional connectivity [ – ]. \n\nThe analysis results showed that dynamic graph attributes shared similar significant features with static graph attributes, as well as identifying dynamic specific significant features. The overlapping significant features were similar between static and dynamic cases, implying that dynamic graph attributes can preserve stable features identified by static analysis. On the other hand, dynamic analysis revealed significant features that were especially useful at classifying patients, reaching the top ROC AUC of 0.86. It can be seen from the dynamic attributes line plot of CCFS at right VACC that the feature distributions of two groups were mixed at first, and split away as time varies. This implies that such high AUC value can only be identified using dynamic functional connectivity. As a result, dynamic analysis can not only identify most significant features as static analysis does, but also reveal extra features that could possibly be used as biomarker for disease classification. \n\n\n### Future considerations \n  \nThere are still some issues to be addressed. First, recent studies have paid more attention to MSA-p type. In the future, exploring MSA different subtypes (parkinsonian and cerebellar variants) would provide valuable biomarkers for the early differential diagnosis of the disease. Second, in this study, we mainly focused on the motor function changes of MSA, as measured by UMSARS. Some MSA patients might present cognitive dysfunction with the disease progresses. In the future, we will collect more samples and classify MSA as two groups according to cognitive performances. We will analyze network attributes to compare the differences between MSA with and without cognitive decline. Third, the sample size is relatively small, and in the future, we will continue to expand the sample size. More samples could also validate statistical analysis methods such as stepwise multivariate logistic models. Finally, in the current study, when measuring dynamic functional connectivity (d-FC), we adopted a sliding-window method, with window length = 100 TR (200 s) and step size = 3 TR (6 s), as a previous research proved that this combination can extract as much features while minimizing computation costs [ ]. And the analysis was performed at each brain region. In the future, we can adopt different sliding-window methods for comparison as well as performing global comparison of graph attributes, which might reveal other evidence on the implications of MSA. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nIn conclusion, by using static and dynamic functional connectivity, we identified significant graph attributes in several specific regions in MSA patients. For the overlapped results, disrupted connectivity in several cerebellar subregions was found in MSA patients relative to controls. In addition, we also identified some static and dynamic specific significant graph attributes. Further ROC analysis revealed that dynamic CCFS at right VACC could be used as the most valuable imaging marker for the early diagnosis of MSA, indicating the advance of dynamic functional connectivity analysis. These findings provided new evidence for the disconnection syndrome of MSA and emphasized the importance of dynamic functional connectivity analysis in deepen the understanding of the disease. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty four MSA c-type patients and twenty controls were recruited at the clinic of Dongfang Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. The two groups were matched for age and gender and all the participants are right-handed. The diagnosis of MSA was according to the established international diagnostic criteria of probable MSA defined by the American Academy of Neurology and American Autonomic Society [ ]. All subjects were evaluated by complete physical and neuropsychological examinations including mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS). The clinical examinations were performed on the day before fMRI scanning. \n\nThe inclusion criteria for controls were as follows: (1) there were no neurological or psychiatric disorders including obsessive disorder, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy and so on; (2) there were lack of significant cognitive decline (MMSE score > 24);(3) there were no neurological deficiencies including visual or hearing loss; (4) there were no treatment with deep brain stimulation or operation (5) there were no evidence of movement disorder, vascular brain lesions, brain tumor, and/or marked cortical and/or subcortical atrophy on MRI scan. \n\nThe exclusion criteria for the subjects were as follows: The subjects of hemorrhage, infarction, tumors, trauma, or severe white matter hyper-intensity were excluded from the study. Clinical and demographic information of the subjects was shown in  . \n\nAll subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Medical Research Ethical Committee of Dong fang Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. \n\n\n### MRI acquisition protocol \n  \nMRI data acquisition was performed on a GE 3.0T Discovery 750 scanner. Foam padding and headphones were used to control head motion and scanner noise. The resting-state fMRI data was acquired by the following parameters with 6 minutes: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)/flip angle (FA) = 2000 ms/30 ms/90°, field of view (FOV) = 24 × 24 cm , resolution = 64 × 64 matrix, number of slices = 36, thickness = 3 mm, gap = 1 mm, voxel size = 3.75 × 3.75 × 3 mm , and bandwidth = 2232 Hz/pixel. In total, 6480 images were acquired for resting state fMRI. All the participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed, move as little as possible, think of nothing in particular, and stay awake during the scans. \n\n\n### Image preprocessing \n  \nThe preprocessing of fMRI data was carried out using DPARSFA (V4.3) [ ] and SPM12 (V6906). We discarded the first 10 time points to let subjects be familiar with the scanning environment. Slice timing correction was then performed. Head motion was corrected before normalizing the image to a 2mm-isotropic BOLD EPI template in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 standard space. The image was resampled to 3-mm isotropic voxels and spatially smoothed by a Gaussian kernel with 4mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM). Then, we removed the linear trend and nuisance covariates, including head motions, cerebral fluid, white matter and the global signal. Finally, the signal time course was filtered to keep signals within 0.01-0.08Hz. \n\nThe data processing was carried out using an in-house software, Multi-Modal Data Processing System (MMDPS) [ ]. We applied both static and dynamic functional connectivity (s-FC and d-FC) to evaluate functional changes in MSA patients. Graph theory attributes were also calculated based on static and dynamic FC. The whole processing pipeline is shown in  . \n  \n Processing pipeline.   Both static and dynamic functional connectivity was calculated based on BOLD fMRI signal. For static functional connectivity, the pair-wise Pearson correlation between two regions was obtained using the whole time series. For dynamic functional connectivity, we utilized the sliding window method to produce a range of functional networks. After network construction, graph theory attributes were calculated based on each functional networks, yielding sFeat for static feature, and dFeats for dynamic features. \n  \n\n### Network construction \n  \nDuring network construction, we adopted a brain atlas to define nodes and constructed brain network for each participant. The atlas consists of 84 whole-brain Brodmann areas [ ] and the cerebellum parcellation from the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas with 26 regions [ ]. Since cerebellum is actively involved in the progression of CMSA, we hope the inclusion of it could reveal disease-specific features. For static functional connectivity (s-FC), the BOLD time course was averaged within each brain area and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for each pair of regions, representing the functional connectivity between these two nodes in the network. \n\nWhen measuring dynamic functional connectivity (d-FC), we adopted a sliding-window method, with window length = 100 TR (200 s) and step size = 3 TR (6 s). A previous research proved that this combination can extract as much features while minimizing computation costs [ ]. The preprocessed data contained 170 TRs so the sliding window method yielded 24 dynamic networks for each subject. \n\n\n### Graph theory attributes calculation \n  \nWe calculated four graph theory attributes to reflect the topology of brain networks. The graph theory attributes are all associated with nodes in networks. The betweenness centrality (BC) of a node is the fraction of all shortest paths in the network that pass through the given node, indicating the nodal ability of information flow throughout the network. The clustering coefficient (CCFS) is the fraction of triangles around a node, measuring the tendency of all nodes in its neighborhood to form a cluster. The local efficiency (LE) of a node is measured as the average sum of inverse shortest path of other nodes to the given node. It quantifies the efficiency of a network to transfer information. And the weighted degree (WD) of a node is the sum of its connectivity strength. Among these four graph theory attributes, CCFS and LE fall in range [0, 1]. BC can be normalized to [0, 1] by dividing by (  n   − 1) × (  n   − 2), where n is the \n\nThese graph theory attributes were calculated based on individual node in each brain network, including both static (s-BC, s-CCFS, s-LE and s-WD) and dynamic networks (d-BC, d-CCFS, d-LE and d-WD). The static network produced one set of graph attributes for each subjects, while dynamic networks yielded graph attributes at each time slice. As a result, 24 data points were calculated for each subject and each attribute. These data points were arranged by time order, forming a fluctuating series of attributes for a participant during the scanning interval. We also measured the stability of dynamic graph attributes using methods proposed in [ ]. All graph theory attributes were normalized to range [0, 1] before calculating stability. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis and feature selection \n  \nThe statistical analysis procedure, including comparison and correlation, is summarized in  . At the first stage, static and dynamic features were analyzed separately and the same procedure was repeated for each one of the four graph attributes. For dynamic graph attributes, since each subject was associated with multiple data points at a range of time slices, we firstly calculated the strength of the dynamic attributes using methods described in [ ] before performing comparison and correlation. \n  \n Statistical analysis procedure.   At the first stage, comparison and correlation analysis was performed for static and dynamic features separately. At the second stage, significantly different and correlated features were combined. At the third stage, significant features found by static and dynamic functional connectivity were merged, as well as incorporating dynamic stability measurements. The circle-plus sign stands for intersection. sFeat, static feature; dFeat, dynamic feature; corr., correlate; Sig., significant; Feat, feature; diff, difference. \n  \nSince the features were not normally distributed, and the sample size was relatively small, we performed non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests between MSA patients and NCs. Significant regions (p < 0.05, uncorrected) were selected, forming a set of significantly different features (Sig. diff. feat. static / dynamic). The comparison of dynamic stability between patients and healthy controls was also performed. On the other hand, the Kendall correlation coefficients were calculated between features and total UMSARS scores. Areas that had a significant correlation (p < 0.05, uncorrected) were extracted, forming a set of significantly correlated features (Sig. corr. static / dynamic). \n\nThen, at the second stage, the significantly different and correlated sets of static and dynamic graph attributes were intersected, yielding static and dynamic significant features (Sig. Feat. static / dynamic). At the third stage, the static and dynamic significant features were further intersected, identifying features that were significant in both static and dynamic cases. Static and dynamic specific features were left out at this stage. The stability of dynamic graph attributes were also incorporated into the dynamic significant features and the intersection gave stability different features. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"d7da701278e99e82257a50a54b107de1"},

Examining time-varying (dynamic) functional connectivity may help explain some inconsistencies. We assessed dynamic network connectivity using resting-state functional MRI in patients with schizophrenia, while unmedicated (  n   = 34), after 1 week (  n   = 29) and 6 weeks of treatment with risperidone (  n   = 24), as well as matched controls at baseline (  n   = 35) and after 6 weeks (  n   = 19). After identifying 41 independent components (ICs) comprising resting-state networks, sliding window analysis was performed on IC timecourses using an optimal window size validated with linear support vector machines. Windowed correlation matrices were then clustered into three discrete connectivity states (a relatively sparsely connected state, a relatively abundantly connected state, and an intermediately connected state). In unmedicated patients, static connectivity was increased between five pairs of ICs and decreased between two pairs of ICs when compared to controls, dynamic connectivity showed increased connectivity between the thalamus and somatomotor network in one of the three states. State statistics indicated that, in comparison to controls, unmedicated patients had shorter mean dwell times and fraction of time spent in the sparsely connected state, and longer dwell times and fraction of time spent in the intermediately connected state. Risperidone appeared to normalize mean dwell times after 6 weeks, but not fraction of time. Results suggest that static connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia may partly be related to altered brain network temporal dynamics rather than consistent dysconnectivity within and between functional networks and demonstrate the importance of implementing complementary data analysis techniques. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSchizophrenia is often described as a disorder of brain connectivity characterized by abnormal structural and functional network integration between cortical areas and likely related to clinical symptoms ( – ). A common approach to examining functional networks is through resting-state functional connectivity—the measure of temporal coherence of low frequency blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations between spatially separate regions of the brain in the absence of a task being performed ( ,  ,  ). \n\nTraditionally, functional connectivity is evaluated over the length of the scan. In schizophrenia, a number of intrinsic network connectivity aberrations have been reported, albeit with widespread inconsistencies among studies ( – ). Importantly, this “static” approach to connectivity analysis disregards the dynamic nature of brain activity by assuming constant connectivity patterns over time ( ,  ). Recent reports attribute inconsistencies across studies to the oversimplification of data in static functional connectivity analyses ( ,  – ). The recent emergence of dynamic functional connectivity analysis aims to address this data averaging issue by calculating transient patterns of functional connectivity through windowed time course sampling ( ,  ,  – ). Clustering of these patterns results in connectivity states that are believed to be representative of discrete mental states of connectivity that subjects pass through during the scan ( ,  ,  ,  ). In capturing the fluctuations in network interactions over time, and ultimately more descriptively characterizing network integration, the progress toward identifying imaging biomarkers may be enhanced. However, the obstacle of determining the correct window size for sliding window analysis still remains. While some studies have indicated a window size between 30 and 60 s robustly estimates functional connectivity ( ,  ), others have explored window sizes ranging from 30 to 240 s ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nPrior resting-state functional connectivity studies reporting dysconnectivity in schizophrenia have been overwhelmingly obtained in medicated subjects. Because antipsychotic medications are known to affect brain activation ( – ), it is unclear to what extent prior findings are related to antipsychotic medication effects. In addition to examination of unmedicated patients with schizophrenia, functional connectivity studies of first episode schizophrenia patients and subjects at ultra-high risk of psychosis ( – ) allow for not only examination of earlier stages of psychosis but also non-confounded (i.e., antipsychotic medication exposure) functional connectivity abnormalities. More specifically Anticevic et al. and Cannon et al. ( ,  ), found that subjects at ultra-high risk who converted to psychosis more prominently exhibited thalamocortical dysconnectivity, whereas Yoon and colleagues found that first episode and ultra-high risk subjects demonstrated frontotemporal dysconnectivity ( ). \n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) in unmedicated patients with schizophrenia and to test if, and how, antipsychotic medications change brain network dynamics after 1 and 6 weeks of treatment in an effort to disentangle medication effects form intrinsic illness characteristics. The corresponding description of dynamic connectivity patterns that may remain unaffected by antipsychotics could in turn contribute to the discovery of biomarkers for the development of new therapeutic interventions targeted at the other symptom domains (i.e., negative and cognitive symptoms) that are not alleviated by traditional antipsychotics ( ). We hypothesized that static and dynamic analyses would provide complementary connectivity results. In accordance with previous studies examining temporal dynamics in schizophrenia ( ), we also hypothesized that connectivity abnormalities would not be observed in all connectivity states; in addition, based on previous studies, we hypothesized that connectivity state abnormalities exhibited would be observed between thalamus and sensory network [i.e., auditory (AUD), visual (VIS), and somatomotor (SM)] connections ( ,  ). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThirty-four unmedicated patients with schizophrenia seeking treatment at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) were recruited from the emergency room, inpatient units, and various outpatient clinics. Additionally, 35 healthy controls matched on age, gender, smoking status, and socioeconomic status (SES) were recruited using flyers and advertisements in the university newspaper. This study was approved by the UAB Institutional Review Board and written informed consent for participation was obtained after participants were found competent to provide informed consent ( ). \n\nDiagnoses were established with review of medical records and evaluation by two board certified psychiatrists (Nina V. Kraguljac and Adrienne C. Lahti) and confirmed using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies ( ). Patients included in the study had been off antipsychotic medication for at least 10 days; medication was not stopped to meet this criterion. Exclusion criteria were major medical conditions, neurological disorders, history of head trauma with loss of consciousness, substance abuse within 6 months of imaging (with the exception of nicotine), use of medication affecting brain function, pregnancy, and MRI contraindications. Healthy control exclusion criteria also included a history of Axis I disorders personally or in first-degree relatives. \n\nSubjects who were either medication naïve or had been off antipsychotic medications were enrolled in a 6-week trial with risperidone using a flexible dosing regimen. Dose determinations were based on therapeutic and side effects. Starting doses were 1 mg; titration was done in 1–2 mg increments. Compliance was monitored by pill counts at each visit. Concomitant antidepressant or mood stabilizing medication was allowed to be used as indicated. \n\n\n### Study Design \n  \nParticipants completed a resting-state fMRI scan of at least 5 min (150 volumes) in length. For data length consistency across participants, additional volumes over 5 min were discarded ( ). All participants were scanned at baseline. Patients were then scanned after 1 and 6 weeks of treatment to allow adequate time for clinical response ( ,  ). Dropout and scanner intolerability are potential issues when working with a patient population. Therefore, of the 34 patients with schizophrenia enrolled, three subjects dropped out of the study prior to the week 1 scan and three more subjects dropped prior to the week 6 scan. One subject was excluded from baseline analysis due to an insufficient number of scan volumes. In addition, no resting-state scans were obtained for two subjects at week 1 and four subjects at week 6, leaving imaging data for 33 patients at baseline, 29 patients at week 1, and 24 patients at week 6 in the final analysis. Additionally, 19 of the 35 recruited controls were scanned for a second time 6 weeks after the baseline scan. Resting-state data from some subjects have been included in earlier reports ( – ). The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) ( ) was used to assess symptom severity weekly due to its briefer time to administer as time is critical when collecting data from unmedicated patients with schizophrenia. Cognitive function was assessed for both groups at baseline using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) ( ). \n\n\n### Scanning Parameters \n  \nAll scans were performed with a 3 T head-only scanner (Magnetom Allegra, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany), with a circularly polarized transmit/receive head coil. High-resolution structural scans were acquired for anatomical reference using the 3-dimensional T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo sequence [repetition time/echo time/inversion time (TR/TE/TI) = 2300/3.93/1100 ms, flip angle = 12°, 256 × 256 matrix, 1-mm isotropic voxels]. Resting-state fMRI scans were acquired using a gradient recalled echo-planar imaging sequence (TR/TE = 2000/30 ms, flip angle = 70°, field of view = 192 mm × 192 mm, 64 × 64 matrix, 6 mm slice thickness, 1 mm gap, 30 axial slices). Participants were instructed to keep eyes open and stare passively ahead during the scan. \n\n\n### Preprocessing \n  \nData preprocessing was performed with SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK ). Resting-state fMRI data were slice-timing corrected, realigned, normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space ( ), resampled to 1.5 mm , and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel to 6-mm full width at half maximum. Prior to group independent component analysis (ICA), data were variance normalized to facilitate decomposition of subcortical (SC) and cortical networks ( ). \n\n\n### Group ICA \n  \nGroup-level spatial ICA was performed   via   the Group ICA of fMRI Toolbox (GIFT ) ( ). Subject-specific principal component analysis (PCA) was implemented in the GIFT toolbox by reducing the data to 120 principal components, which were subsequently decomposed into 100 components   via   group data reduction ( ). The expectation maximization algorithm was used to carry out PCA in a memory-efficient manner ( ,  ). The Infomax algorithm ( ,  ) was then applied to the PCA reduced data to generate 100 spatially independent components (ICs). Component stability/quality was measured by repeating the Infomax algorithm 20 times in ICASSO and the most representative run was used in subsequent steps ( ,  ,  ). Subject-specific spatial maps and time courses were generated   via   GICA back-reconstruction ( ). Scanning data for patients after 1 week of medication (  n   = 29) was also included in the group ICA and clustering analysis. Following back-reconstruction, subject spatial maps and time courses were scaled to   z  -scores. \n\n\n### Postprocessing \n  \nSimilar to procedures carried out in previous studies ( ,  ,  ), three reviewers (Kristin K. Lottman, Nina V. Kraguljac, David M. White) collectively classified ICs as resting-state networks (RSNs)—as opposed to artifact—based on criteria-dependent visual inspection of group-level component spatial maps and evaluation of power spectra data. Group-level component spatial maps were inspected and classified as RSNs based on the criteria that peak activation clusters should occur primarily in gray matter, correspond anatomically to brain networks, and meet additional RSN expectations presented in ( ,  ,  ). To facilitate component classification as RSNs, component power spectra data were evaluated using the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFFs) ( ,  ) in order to validate that component time courses were characterized by predominantly low-frequency fluctuations ( ,  ,  ). Based on reviewer consensus, the three reviewers collectively identified 41 group-level RSNs from the 100 extracted components, as illustrated in Figure  . RSN labels were identified based on results from brain atlas toolboxes utilized in SPM8—xjView  and WFU_PickAtlas . Additionally, RSN labels were determined based on correspondence to the 50 components presented in ( ), as well as label consensus among all three reviewers (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material for RSN peak activations). Labeled RSNs were then organized into seven different networks including SC, AUD, SM, VIS, cognitive control (CC), default mode (DM), and cerebellar (CB) ( ). \n  \n Composite maps of the 41 independent components comprising resting-state networks extracted from the data   via   group independent component analysis and categorized into subcortical, auditory, somatomotor, visual, cognitive control, default mode, and cerebellar networks  . Each color in the composite map represents a different component and the number of components grouped in each category is indicated next to the category name. Peak activations of individual components can be seen in Table S1 in Supplementary Material. \n  \nFollowing RSN identification, framewise displacement was regressed from the subject-specific RSN time courses prior to static and dynamic connectivity analyses. Framewise displacement was computed as the absolute frame-to-frame displacement of the brain from the six realignment parameters using a radius of 50 mm to convert angle rotations to displacements ( ,  ). Ultimately, this resulted in individual displacement values for each volume of the time course (i.e., 150 frame-to-frame displacement values—with an initial displacement value of 0—were used as regression covariates for each subject). While controls and unmedicated patients (baseline) exhibited differences in mean framewise displacement (  F   = 6.867,   p   = 0.011) as expected, patients did not demonstrate significant differences in mean framewise displacement from baseline to week 6 (  F   = 0.200,   p   = 0.659) or week 1 to week 6 (  F   = 3.517,   p   = 0.075). However, mean framewise displacement was found to be significantly different between baseline and week 1 patients (  F   = 4.325,   p   = 0.047) Subsequently, subject-specific RSN time courses were detrended, despiked, and band-pass filtered (0.01–0.15 Hz) using a fifth order Butterworth filter in accordance with previous studies ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Static Functional Network Connectivity Analysis \n  \nStatic functional network connectivity was estimated for each subject as the pairwise Pearson correlation between whole RSN component time courses, resulting in a 41-by-41-component   z  -scored correlation matrix for each subject. Correlation matrices for subjects in a group were then averaged together resulting in a group-level connectivity matrix (Figures  A–E). Subsequently, within and between-group differences in static functional network connectivity matrices were evaluated on subject-level matrices   via   respective paired and two-sample univariate   t  -tests with a significance value of   p   < 0.05 (Figures  F,G). \n  \n Static functional network connectivity  . Group-level mean static functional network connectivity for   (A)   35 controls at baseline (HCb),   (B)   19 controls after 6 weeks (HC6),   (C)   33 unmedicated patients with schizophrenia (SZb),   (D)   29 patients after 1 week of medication (SZ1), and   (E)   24 patients after 6 weeks of medication (SZ6). Group differences are shown between   (F)   controls and unmedicated patients (HCb-SZb) and   (G)   unmedicated patients and week 6 patients (SZb-SZ6). Significant group differences outlined with a small black box are indicated if   p   < 0.05. No significant differences were observed when week 1 patients were compared to baseline and week 6 patients. \n  \n\n### dFNC Analysis \n  \nA sliding window technique was used to estimate dFNC where windowed segments of the component time courses were used to compute transient functional network connectivity patterns (Figure  ). Sliding window analysis was iteratively performed with window sizes of 30, 40, 44, 50, and 60 s. Window sizes were selected based on previous studies indicating functional connectivity can be robustly estimated using a window size between 30 and 60 s ( ,  ), as well as previous implementation of a 44 s window in a dataset of patients with schizophrenia ( ). A Gaussian (σ = 3 TRs) window of the respective size was slid through the time course in steps of one TR in order to obtain windowed correlation matrices for each subject (Figure  A). Due to potential effects of noise on covariance estimation from sampling short time windows, windowed correlation matrices were generated by estimating the covariance of the L1 regularized inverse covariance matrix, which was carried out utilizing a graphical LASSO framework in the GIFT Toolbox ( ,  ,  – ). \n  \n Schematic depicting dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analyses  .   (A)   dFNC analysis computes functional network connectivity on windows of the independent component time courses and hence windowed correlation matrices are generated for each subject.   (B)   Concatenation of dFNC windows for all subjects and subsequent   k  -means clustering of the windows results in cluster centroids or connectivity states.   (C)   dFNC cluster centroids for 44 s window. \n  \n\n### Window Size Classification \n  \nA 44 s window was chosen based on implementation in previous studies in a similar subset of subjects. Subsequently, similar to a previous study ( ), the optimal window size of 44 s for dynamic analyses was validated by the accuracy of a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier in predicting group (i.e., controls and unmedicated patients) based on the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation of functional connectivity (ALFF-FC) for each subject and respective window sizes. ALFF-FC is utilized in order to demonstrate the variability in network connections over time ( ). In order to calculate the ALFF-FC, the fast fourier transform (FFT) was applied to the windowed correlation values for each subject ( ). Subsequently, the FFT values divided by the largest frequency value (i.e., 0.5 Hz) that fell within the frequency band of 0.01–0.08 Hz were summed to obtain ALFF-FC maps for each subject ( ). \n\nA linear SVM classifier was utilized to discriminate between controls and unmedicated patients. A leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) method was applied to determine the average accuracy values of the SVM classifier. For each iteration of LOOCV, one sample is designated as a test sample and the remaining samples are designated as the training set. A two-sample t-test between the ALFF-FC values of controls and unmedicated patients in the training set was performed at each LOOCV fold ( ). In order to reduce the number of features, as well as the possibility of overfitting, only the significant resultant values (  p   < 0.05) were selected as predictor features ( ). Therefore, the number of predictor features varied from fold-to-fold of the LOOCV. Additionally, SVM classification was only performed to discriminate between controls and unmedicated patients; thus, only 68-folds of the LOOCV were carried out. SVM classifier analysis was performed on dynamic data from implementation of the five different window sizes (30, 40, 44, 50, and 60 s). The optimal window size was determined as the window size with the best accuracy in differentiating control and patient ALFF-FC using the SVM classifier. This SVM classification was performed using the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox in MATLAB ( ). \n\n\n### Clustering \n  \nIn order to characterize reoccurring patterns of connectivity across groups and time,   k  -means clustering was performed on the windowed correlation matrices for all subjects (Figure  B). Clustering of a sub-sampled number of windows (i.e., windows with relative maxima of variance) for all groups and time points was carried out in order to estimate initial cluster centroids (cluster medians) ( ,  ). The sum of absolute differences or L1 distance method was used with a maximum of 150 iterations for   k  -means cluster computation. The optimal number of cluster states was determined to be three based on evaluation of the elbow criterion of the ratio of within cluster sum of squares distance to between cluster sum of squares distance ( ,  ). More specifically, the number of clusters is determined as the point or “elbow” in the plot (i.e., ratio by cluster number) followed by a flattening of the plot where increasing number of   k   clusters provides marginal information ( ). Resultant centroid states from the clustering of sub-sampled data were subsequently used as initial clustering positions for clustering of all subject and group data. \n\n\n### Group Differences in dFNC \n  \nFollowing   k  -means clustering of data from all subjects mean group-level connectivity centroid states were calculated from the group’s subject medians of windows assigned to each respective state ( ). Subsequently, respective paired and two-sample univariate   t  -tests were performed on the subject-level connectivity states to evaluate group differences. Group differences of   p   < 0.05 were considered significant. It is important to note that implementation of L1 regularization using the graphical LASSO framework for dynamic windowing resulted in small variations in windowed correlations from run to run. Therefore, in order to account for potential fluctuations in significant group differences from iteration to iteration, as well as determine connectivity reliability, bootstrap resampling (i.e., resampling with replacement) was conducted on clustered windowed correlation values with a resampling rate of 10,000. Group differences (  p   < 0.05) that occurred in at least 95% of the 10,000 bootstrap resamples were considered significant. \n\nExploratory   post hoc   analyses examining group differences in state statistics including dwell times (i.e., average amount of time spent occupying a state before switching to another) and overall amount of time spent in a state were implemented using two-sample and paired univariate   t  -tests, where appropriate. Transition matrix differences for each group were also evaluated   via   chi-square methods ( – ). More specifically, transition matrices represent the probability of transitioning from one state to another (e.g., state 1 to state 2, etc.) ( ). Additionally, the relationship between clinical improvement and state statistics were examined   via   correlation analysis of mean dwell time/fraction of time spent in a state and treatment response. Treatment response was defined as the percent change in positive BPRS scores from baseline to week 6. In order to demonstrate the complementary nature of connectivity analyses, the effectiveness of static, dynamic, and both static and dynamic connectivity analyses in classifying controls and patients was evaluated   via   group classification using a linear SVM and LOOCV. Significant connectivity values, fraction of time spent in a state, and mean dwell time were used as predictor variables. More specifically, the effectiveness of static connectivity analyses was evaluated with seven connectivity predictor variables. The effectiveness of dynamic connectivity analyses was evaluated with fraction of time spent in a state and mean dwell time values (i.e., six predictor variables). Both static and dynamic connectivity analysis accuracy was evaluated with all aforementioned predictor variables (i.e., 13 predictor variables). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographics \n  \nNo significant differences in age, gender, parental SES, smoking status, or daily cigarette use were observed between controls and patients. Patients exhibited a decrease in total BPRS scores from 48.29 ± 9.38 at baseline to 30.57 ± 8.47 after 6 weeks of medication. Average dose of risperidone was 4.36 ± 1.45 mg at the week 6 scan. Twelve subjects were concomitantly treated with benztropine, two with trazodone, one each was prescribed mirtazapine, amitriptyline, and valproic acid. In comparison to healthy controls, patients scored significantly lower on RBANS (Table  ). \n  \n Demographics and clinical assessments  . \n  \n HC, healthy control; SZ, schizophrenia; SES, socioeconomic status; Y, yes; N, no; BPRS, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; RBANS, Repeated Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status  . \n  \n\n### RSN Identification \n  \nThe 41 maximally ICs identified as RSNs are depicted in Figure  . Labeled RSNs were then organized into seven different networks including SC (3 RSNs), AUD (3 RSNs), VIS (9 RSNs), SM (8 RSNs), CC (10 RSNs), DM (5 RSNs), and CB (3 RSNs; Table S1 in Supplementary Material). \n\n\n### Window Size Classification \n  \nThe 44-s window size is in accordance with the window size implemented in previous studies examining dynamic connectivity in controls ( ) and in patients with schizophrenia ( ). The optimal window size was validated to be 44 s since classifier accuracy was highest (i.e., 77.94%) at this window size. A 10,000-iteration permutation test indicated the probability of obtaining this accuracy value with a 44 s window was not by chance (  p   < 0.05) ( ). \n\n\n### Group Differences in Static Functional Network Connectivity \n  \n#### Between Group Differences \n  \nMean static functional network connectivity matrices for baseline controls, week 6 controls, unmedicated patients, week 1, and week 6 patients are illustrated in Figures  A–E. In comparison to controls, unmedicated patients demonstrated increased connectivity within the CC network and between the SC-SM, VIS-CC, and SM-CC network connections, but decreased connectivity between the SC-CC and AUD-CC networks (Figure  F). \n\n\n#### Connectivity Changes over Time \n  \nNo significant differences (  p   > 0.05) in connectivity were exhibited when comparing unmedicated and week 6 medicated patients (Figure  G), as well as baseline and week 6 controls. Additionally, week 1 patients demonstrated no significant connectivity differences (  p   > 0.05) when compared to baseline and week 6 patients. \n\n\n\n### Group Differences in dFNC \n  \n#### Between Group Differences \n  \nCluster centroids for all subjects and time points are shown in Figure  C. Three discrete connectivity states, a relatively sparsely connected state (State 1), a relatively abundantly connected state (State 2), and an intermediately connected state (State 3) were identified. No significant differences (  p   > 0.05) in connectivity were exhibited when comparing controls to unmedicated patients, week 1 patients, and week 6 patients. While bootstrap resampling of windowed correlations was implemented to determine connectivity stability/reliability, analyses resulted in no significant connectivity differences in more than 95% of the 10,000 resamples. It is important to note that, in comparison to controls, unmedicated patients exhibited some instances of hyperconnectivity (  p   < 0.05) between SC (i.e., IC 45 (thalamus) and SM network connections in the sparsely connected state (State 1) among the 10,000 resamples. \n\n\n#### Connectivity Changes over Time \n  \nEvaluation of significant state connectivity differences across time in patients with schizophrenia indicates no significant change in connectivity (i.e., hyper- or hypo-connectivity—between baseline and week 1, baseline and week 6, and week 1 and week 6 over time (  p   < 0.05)). In addition, no significant connectivity differences (  p   < 0.05) were exhibited between baseline and week 6 in controls. \n\n\n#### Connectivity State Statistics \n  \nExploratory   post hoc   analyses reveal no significant group differences in transition probabilities between states across groups. Comparison of mean dwell times indicates that unmedicated patients tend to dwell in the sparsely connected state 1 for significantly less time (  p   = 0.0334) and the intermediate state 3 for significantly more time (  p   = 0.0055) than controls (Figure  ). After 6 weeks of risperidone treatment, state 1 dwell times significantly increased in patients (  p   = 0.0115), but state 3 dwell times remain unchanged (  p   = 0.1718) in comparison to unmedicated patients (Figure  ). Additionally, comparison of the fraction of time groups occupy in individual states indicate that unmedicated patients occupy state 1 significantly less (  p   = 0.0105) and state 3 significantly more than controls (  p   = 0.0029), but this was not affected by treatment (  p   > 0.05). Comparison of healthy controls over time indicates no significant differences in mean dwell time (  p   > 0.05) and fraction of time spent in a state (  p   > 0.05) for all three states (intraclass correlation coefficients for controls over time presented in Table S2 in Supplementary Material). Patients after 1 week of medication demonstrated no significant differences in mean dwell time (  p   > 0.05) and fraction of time spent in a state (  p   > 0.05) for all three states when compared to patients at baseline and week 6. See Table S3 in Supplementary Material for all   post hoc   connectivity state statistics. \n  \n Connectivity state statistics  . Exploratory   post hoc   analysis of mean dwell time   (A)   and fraction of time   (B)   subjects spend in each state at each window size. Mean group dwell times   (A)   and mean fraction of time groups spend in a state   (B)   are depicted with error bars representing the standard error of the mean. Significant group differences (  p   < 0.05) obtained   via   respective two-sample and paired   t  -tests are indicated with asterisks. \n  \nAdditional exploratory   post hoc   analyses of clinical symptoms revealed no significant correlation between dwell times/fraction of time spent in a state and treatment response. Group classification using linear SVMs demonstrated a higher effectiveness (i.e., classification accuracy) of 83.8% (sensitivity: 91.4%; specificity: 75.8%) when incorporating both static and dynamic data as predictor variables, compared to the utilization of individual static (accuracy: 73.5%; sensitivity: 80%; specificity: 67%) and dynamic (accuracy: 58.8%; sensitivity: 74.3%; specificity: 42.4%) predictor variables. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first resting-state functional connectivity study examining brain network temporal dynamics in unmedicated patients with schizophrenia and the effects of antipsychotic medication. We describe widespread static connectivity abnormalities, both hyper- and hypo-connectivity, between controls and unmedicated patients with schizophrenia. Dynamic analyses suggest three discrete connectivity states, a relatively sparsely connected state, a relatively abundantly connected state, and an intermediate state. Significantly increased connectivity was present only between the thalamus and SM network in one state in unmedicated patients compared to controls, but we found no evidence of decreased connectivity in any states. Exploratory analyses of state statistics indicate that, in comparison to controls, unmedicated patients have shorter mean dwell times and fraction of time spent in the sparsely connected state, and longer dwell times and fraction of time spent in the intermediately connected state. Risperidone appears to normalize mean dwell times, but not fraction of time spent. \n\nIn unmedicated patients, our static functional network connectivity results reveal altered patterns of functional connectivity within the CC network and between the SM-SC, CC-VIS, AUD-CC, SM-CC, and CC-SC networks. These results are in line with recent studies in medicated patients demonstrating altered systems-level brain network dysfunction that suggest impaired integration within and between bottom-up and top-down networks ( ,  ). Similar to studies that use a seed-based ( ,  ) or static and dynamic ( ) functional connectivity approaches in medicated patients, we observed increased SC-SM static connectivity in unmedicated patients compared to controls. Likewise, previous studies in subjects at ultra-high risk of psychosis demonstrated thalamocortical ( ,  ) and frontotemporal ( ) dysconnectivity. Interestingly, risperidone did not appear to change this SC-SM dysconnectivity pattern, despite several recent reports that suggest that antipsychotic medications may affect functional connectivity ( ,  ,  – ). However, it is important to note that although a similar sample was utilized in ( ), disparate findings may be attributable to varying analysis techniques. \n\nAlthough widespread dysconnectivity in schizophrenia is reported throughout the literature [see Pettersson-Yeo et al. ( ), for review], a large portion of the literature reports decreased functional connectivity strength in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls, as well as the involvement of prefrontal brain region connections ( ,  ,  ,  ). In comparison, our static connectivity results (with the exception of a CC-SC and AUD-CC connection) demonstrate increased connectivity in patients compared to controls. While differences in our dysconnectivity results may be attributable to the inclusion of an unmedicated population, as well as variable experimental design and analysis, the heterogeneity of the disorder and inconsistencies in the underlying neural mechanisms may also impact the functional outcome ( – ). \n\nDynamic connectivity analyses only replicate thalamus-SM hyperconnectivity found in static analyses in one of the three connectivity states, but do not demonstrate evidence of dysconnectivity within or between any other RSNs in any state. While the exact etiology of the connectivity states presented in this work is unknown, recent studies have reported that connectivity states may correspond to stages of consciousness ( ,  ). Therefore, these characteristic state-dependent connectivity patterns exhibited in dynamic analysis are promising for future identification of potential imaging biomarkers representative of the disorder of schizophrenia ( ). The limited evidence of connectivity abnormalities in dynamic analyses may very well be a more comprehensive illustration of connectivity abnormalities in comparison to analyses that “oversimplify” the data with static time course assumptions ( ,  ). \n\nExploratory   post hoc   analyses of state statistics revealed that controls spend the majority of time in a sparsely connected state, while unmedicated patients with schizophrenia do so less. In accordance with these results, mean dwell time analysis demonstrated that controls tend to dwell for a significantly longer time in the sparsely connected state compared to unmedicated patients; however, patient dwell time in the sparsely connected state normalizes after 6 weeks of risperidone treatment. It is tempting to speculate that dwell time abnormalities may be related to disorganized patterns of neuronal activity, potentially secondary to glutamatergic hyperactivity ( ) thought to be present in unmedicated patients with schizophrenia ( – ). Conceivably, this disorganized firing pattern could result in patients being unable to reside in a sparsely connected state for extended periods of time leading to an impaired ability to filter out irrelevant information. Alternatively, dopaminergic hyperactivity attenuated by antipsychotic medication may also explain findings. Pharmacological animal models of schizophrenia have demonstrated restoration of cortical synchronization with antipsychotic medications ( ,  ), which could in turn result in dwell time normalization to control levels following risperidone treatment. \n\nThe lack of connectivity abnormalities before and after antipsychotic medication in the presence of medication-dependent dwell time abnormalities further substantiate the non-specific impact of antipysychotic medications on functional connectivity illustrated by Lui and colleagues ( ). Additionally, these results are not discernible in static analyses, therefore, indicating the value of assessing functional connectivity dynamically in order to more accurately distinguish patient populations ( ). \n\nThe differences in connectivity demonstrated in static analyses, as well as dwell time and fraction of time abnormalities in dynamic analyses, not only reiterate the advantage of the dynamic approach to examining functional connectivity but may also suggest the complementary nature of static and dynamic functional connectivity analyses ( ,  ). Additionally,   post hoc   classification analyses support this complementary relationship. Based on this information, future studies would benefit from utilizing both static and dynamic analyses for assessing functional connectivity ( ). \n\nSeveral strengths and limitations have to be considered in the interpretation of our findings. To avoid the confounding effects of medication on functional connectivity, we only enrolled subjects free of exposure to antipsychotic medications for at least 10 days preceding the baseline scan. To minimize variance in the data, we carefully matched groups on several factors including parental SES and smoking, did rigorous preprocessing, and used a longitudinal design with a single antipsychotic medication to evaluate whether baseline dysconnectivity patterns normalized with treatment. In addition, we controlled for the effect of time on functional connectivity by scanning a group of matched controls 6 weeks apart. A sliding window analysis was implemented with a window size of 22 TRs (44 s) in order to estimate connectivity dynamics. Previous studies have indicated a window size between 30 and 60 s robustly estimates functional connectivity ( ,  ). In addition, Telesford and colleagues demonstrated that smaller window sizes are more sensitive to detecting individual differences, whereas group-level differences can be better estimated at larger window sizes ( ); however, a standard window size has yet to be established. While we are confident in our machine learning approach to validating the optimal window size, future work exploring potential data-driven window size determination methods would be welcomed. Similarly, time-frequency approaches may also be useful as such approaches do not require windowing ( ). Furthermore, physiological artifacts such as heart rate and breathing were not directly controlled for during acquisition. Although image preprocessing and ICA indirectly controls for these, results may be impacted by physiological and motion artifacts. While the complementary nature of static and dynamic analyses of resting-state fMRI was demonstrated   via   utilization of a linear SVM (i.e., 83.8% classification accuracy), future studies utilizing multimodal data may further increase this classification accuracy ( ). Although the sample size used in this study is sufficient for robustly estimating static functional connectivity, state connectivity patterns and group differences may be impacted from an inadequate number of subjects exhibiting certain states. Additionally, due to the complex nature of dynamic connectivity patterns, development of multifaceted statistics to capture these complexities would be advantageous. For example, current analyses restrict subjects to exhibiting a single connectivity state at a specific time when there may in fact be an overlap in connectivity state manifestation. The ability to capture potentially overlapping connectivity states ( ,  – ) may provide critical information to ultimately understanding the intricacies of brain function. It is also important to note that the choice of the frequency band utilized when filtering data may impact functional connectivity ( ), as well as the classification accuracy in differentiating patients and controls ( ). Due to the lack of a placebo group in this study, changes in functional connectivity cannot definitively be characterized as medication effects. In addition, schizophrenia is a highly heterogeneous disorder in which there are likely multiple pathological mechanisms causing patients to react differentially to antipsychotic medications. Therefore, until the underlying pathological mechanisms and ultimately the heterogeneity of the disorder are identified, analysis results may continue to remain variable as no one specific analysis technique can be distinguished as optimal. \n\nOur results suggest that static connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia may partly be related to altered brain network temporal dynamics rather than dysconnectivity of within and between functional networks alone. Medications appear to partially attenuate, but not fully reverse, brain network dynamic alterations, suggesting that dynamic connectivity could be leveraged as biomarker for the development of novel treatments targeted toward symptom dimensions that are unaffected by antipsychotic medications.

Close examination of temporal changes have revealed a small set of whole-brain connectivity patterns called dynamic states. Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) studies have demonstrated that it is possible to replicate the dynamic states across several resting state experiments. However, estimation of states and their temporal dynamicity still suffers from noisy and imperfect estimations. In regular dFNC implementations, states are estimated by comparing connectivity patterns through the data without considering time, in other words only zero order changes are examined. In this work we propose a method that includes first order variations of dFNC in the searching scheme of dynamic connectivity patterns. Our approach, referred to as temporal variation of functional network connectivity (tvFNC), estimates the derivative of dFNC, and then searches for reoccurring patterns of concurrent dFNC states and their derivatives. The tvFNC method is first validated using a simulated dataset and then applied to a resting-state fMRI sample including healthy controls (HC) and schizophrenia (SZ) patients and compared to the standard dFNC approach. Our dynamic approach reveals extra patterns in the connectivity derivatives complementing the already reported state patterns. State derivatives consist of additional information about increment and decrement of connectivity among brain networks not observed by the original dFNC method. The tvFNC shows more sensitivity than regular dFNC by uncovering additional FNC differences between the HC and SZ groups in each state. In summary, the tvFNC method provides a new and enhanced approach to examine time-varying functional connectivity. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nConnectivity studies have uncovered a complex functional organization of brain connectome thanks to the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) ( ;  ). The existence of disease-related abnormalities in the human connectome brings progress toward the use of fMRI acquisition in the clinical setting ( ). As with any biological system, the brain connectome does not function in a static manner. Researchers have recognized the importance of developing techniques to characterize dynamic features embedded in the connectome dynamics ( ;  ). Although one of the most basic measures of dynamicity is the derivative, this feature is underexplored in the context of functional connectivity. This limitation is related to the fact that functional connectivity is linked to the phase between neuronal activations ( ). Study of the phase dynamics is more difficult to characterize than the dynamics of the actual activations. This work fills the gap by focusing on the derivative as a measure of the instantaneous variation of brain connectivity. \n\nFunctional connectivity measures the level of co-activation of fMRI time-series from anatomically separated brain regions ( ). Previous connectivity studies considered functional connectivity to remain constant during the scan duration ( ;  ). Recent studies applying the dynamic FNC method (dFNC) have demonstrated that temporal functional network connectivity (FNC) analysis (i.e., co-activation between covarying networks estimated via independent component analysis) can uncover reoccurring connectivity patterns at resting state or during task performances. Their results also indicate that brain connectivity patterns iterate through time and show smooth variations of connectivity ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The dFNC method provides a way to explore temporally transient changes in the functional connectivity among brain networks using sliding windows to compute FNC across time ( ;  ). Among the limitations of the dFNC method, is the lack of justification for the reporting of very similar connectivity states identified by k-means clustering algorithm. At glance, the similar states can be combined into one state without taking into account the states temporal behavior. In this work, we aim to improve the ability of the dFNC method to characterize connectivity dynamics by including derivatives of windowed FNC in the identification of reoccurring states of connectivity. \n\nOur approach referred to as temporal variation of functional network connectivity (tvFNC) is validated with a simulated data sample, and then applied to a resting-state fMRI sample formed by healthy controls (HC) and schizophrenia (SZ) patients that was previously analyzed with the original dFNC method ( ). Among our goals were: to extend time-varying FNC states characterization by including the first derivatives of the windowed FNC; to provide complement states differentiation by including their derivatives information; to expose group differences not captured by the current dFNC method. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Static Functional Network Connectivity \n  \nStatic FNC (sFNC) analysis is based on the assumption that functional connectivity, defined as statistical dependence among N number of fMRI time-courses does not change during scanning time. Currently available connectivity measures include correlations ( ), coherence ( ;  ) and mutual information ( ;  ) among others. In this study, functional connectivity is measured via the Pearson’s pairwise correlation, which is the most widely used approach to date ( ;  ). Correlations between each pair of time-courses generates a FNC vector with N (N-1)/2 unique FNC values. The FNC vector is then represented by an NxN symmetric FNC matrix ( ). \n  \nFunctional network connectivity (FNC) subject’s data,   (A)   Static FNC,   (B)   Dynamic FNC, and   (C)   Temporal variation of FNC. \n  \n\n### Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity \n  \nThe dFNC analysis is an extension of sFNC, developed to capture time-varying FNC. In this method each time-course is discretized into a set of time domains using the sliding windowed approach ( ;  ). Then, in each time-windowed domain a FNC vector is calculated. This procedure generates a discrete sequence of windowed FNC (wFNC) vectors that are then represented by wFNC matrices ( ) describing connectivity behavior across time ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Subjects’ dFNC data is formed by all wFNC vectors, and is referred to as the zero order derivatives of the sliding window correlations. In summary, the dFNC method pipeline is as follows, for all subjects compute sliding windowed correlations (wFNC); form dFNC data by stacking time-wise all subjects’ dFNC data; run clustering analysis on dFNC data to identify reoccurring connectivity states. \n\n\n### Temporal Variation of Functional Network Connectivity \n  \nThe tvFNC analysis is an extension of dFNC, aiming to improve state classification by including wFNC derivatives in the clustering step. First order time derivatives of wFNC vectors are computed using finite difference approximations. For each subject, the discrete derivative of the first wFNC was estimated using the forward difference formula, Dw FNC = w FNC – w FNC. The discrete derivatives of the interior wFNC were estimated using central difference formula, Dw FNC = (w FNC – w FNC)/2, for   i   = 2 to W−1, where W is the number of windows. Lastly, the discrete derivative of the last wFNC was estimated using the backward difference formula, Dw FNC = w FNC – w FNC. Subjects’ DdFNC data is formed by all wFNC derivatives, and is referred to as the first order derivatives of the sliding window correlations. \n\nThe tvFNC method pipeline is as follows, for all subjects (1) compute dFNC data (sliding windowed correlations wFNC); (2) estimate DdFNC data (derivatives of sliding windowed correlations DwFNC); (3) concatenate row wise zero and first order windowed correlations [wFNC and DwFNC] divided by their corresponding standard deviations ( ). The tvFNC data is formed by stacking time-wise all subjects [dFNC and DdFNC] data, and is referred to as the zero and first order derivatives of the sliding window correlations; (4) run clustering analysis on all subjects’ tvFNC data to identify reoccurring connectivity states and their derivatives patterns. \n\n\n### Clustering Analysis \n  \nIn both methods dFNC and tvFNC, time-varying connectivity is captured by performing k-means clustering analysis, assigning all subjects’ temporal FNC data into a selected number of clusters representing distinct functional connectivity states. The clustering algorithm selection is based on previous connectivity studies that successfully applied k-means algorithm to identify reoccurring patterns of connectivity within and between subjects across time ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). We refer to  ,  , and   for details on k-means clustering validation. The k-means clustering algorithm is applied to the temporal FNC data with the number of clusters ranging from 1 to K along with the Elbow criterion to identify the optimal number of clusters referred to as states. The optimal number of clusters is selected from the Elbow criterion cluster index results. The cluster index is defined as the ratio between the sums of the within-cluster sums of point-to-centroid distances to the sums of all the distances from each point to every centroid ( ). \n\n\n### Simulated Data \n  \nThe simulated data was designed to show the tvFNC method for a given a number of subjects S, and their corresponding N number of fMRI time-courses. For simplicity, we considered   N   = 12 and generated tvFNC data for   S   = 300 subjects. For simulation purposes, the subjects were divided into five groups with the same number of individuals in each group. For each subject, a time-varying sequence of 136 wFNC vectors describing subjects’ dFNC behavior during scan duration was created. The number of windows,   W   = 136 was chosen to match the one obtained in the dFNC analysis of the selected fMRI data sample. Each simulated FNC and wFNC vectors contains 66 [=N (N−1)/2)] unique FNC pairs. Subjects’ dFNC data sets were created using three distinct connectivity patterns referred to as FNC seeds plus perturbation seeds created using random noise and white Gaussian noise (σ = 0.003). The first FNC seed shows a pattern with positive connectivity in the upper left block. The second FNC seed shows a pattern with positive connectivity in the lower right block. The third FNC seed shows a pattern with positive connectivity in the upper right and lower left blocks. FNC seed patterns are shown in  . The perturbation seeds were chosen to be the first derivatives of the FNC seeds. These derivatives were tailored to have unique patterns simulating subject specific differences existing in real data. FNC seed derivatives patterns are shown in  . \n  \nSimulated data,   (A)   FNC seeds,   (B)   derivatives of FNC seeds,   (C)   Elbow criterion results for dFNC and tvFNC methods, panels   (D,E)   show FNC states and their derivatives choosing optimal number of clusters = 5. \n  \nThe simulation is initialized by setting the first window to the seed pattern plus noise: w FNC = FNC seed. Windowed FNC vectors are then simulated by using the recursive equation: w FNC = w FNC ± DFNC seed + N(0,σ),   i   = 1 to W−1. The symbol ± indicates that DFNC seed was added in some subjects, but subtracted in others. The recurrent equation was applied only to generate dFNC data from seeds 1 and 2. Dynamic FNC data generated from the third FNC seed did not include the derivative term DFNC seed. This way we covered the cases where states can have different derivative patterns across time (derivatives could go in opposite directions) and where there are no significant derivative changes. Next, first order time DdFNC of simulated data were computed, and tvFNC data was formed as previously explained. Then, the k-means clustering algorithm was applied to each simulated temporal FNC set ([dFNC] and [dFNC DdFNC]) with the number of clusters ranging from 1 to 10 along with the Elbow criterion to identify the optimal number of clusters. The simulations were repeated one hundred times and mean values of cluster index were computed. \n\n\n### Resting State fMRI Data \n  \n#### Data Sample \n  \nThe resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data used in this study was taken from the Functional Imaging Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN) Phase III study. Participants (healthy controls and patients) were recruited in seven sites across the United States. Participants’ information and scan collection was approved by all seven sites’ institutional review boards (IRB). The sample is formed by a total of 314 participants. The cohort includes 163 healthy controls (117 males, 46 females; average age 36.9 years) and 151 age- and gender matched patients with SZ (114 males, 37 females; average age 37.8 years). \n\n\n#### Data Acquisition \n  \nAll participants provided written informed consent before scanning. Resting-state fMRI scans were collected at seven sites using a 3T Siemens Tim Trio System scanner in six locations and a 3T General Electric Discovery MR750 scanner in one location. Participants were asked to lay still, stay awake and keep their eyes closed during the whole scan duration. In all sites, T2 -weighted gradient-echo echo-planar images (EPIs) were acquired with the following parameters: voxel size = 3.4375 × 3.4375 × 4.0 mm , repetition time (TR) = 2 s, eco time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle (FA) = 77 degrees, field of view (FOV) = 220 × 220 mm (64 × 64 matrix), slice thickness = 4 mm, gap = 1 mm, number of slices = 32 sequential ascending slices. Scans lasted 5:4 min, a total of 162 volumes of echo planar imaging BOLD fMRI were collected. \n\n\n#### Data Pre-processing, Group Independent Component Analysis, and Post-processing \n  \nDetail information of selected rsfMRI scans quality control, pre-processing, group independent component analysis (GICA), and post-processing can be found in  . In summary, functional images were preprocessed using custom written Matlab scripts along with three available toolboxes, Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) , Spatial Parametric Mapping (SPM) , and Group ICA/IVA of fMRI Toolbox (GIFT) . Rigid body motion correction was performed using INRIalign ( ). Resting-state fMRI scans were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space ( ), resliced to 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm voxels, and smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 6 mm. Lastly, each voxel time-course was variance normalized completing the data preprocess step. Participants (HC and SZ) whole brain functional parcellation was obtained by applying the spatial GICA algorithm implemented in the GIFT toolbox ( ;  ) to the preprocessed fMRI data. Spatial GICA is an extension of spatial ICA, which decomposes all subjects’ fMRI data into linear mixtures of maximally spatially independent components and provides their unique time-course profiles. One hundred independent components (ICs) representing whole brain functional parcellation were obtained using principal component analysis ( ) and the infomax algorithm ( ). Subjects’ ICs anatomical brain regions referred as spatial maps and their corresponding time-courses were obtained using the spatiotemporal regression back reconstruction approach ( ;  ). Out of the 100 ICs that were estimated,   N   = 47 ICs were identified as meaningful resting state networks (RSNs) by evaluating the ratio of high to low frequency power in the spectra of components, as well as whether peak activations took place in gray matter ( ;  ;  ). Post-processing of the selected 47 RSNs time-courses included: detrending and despiking using 3DDespike, filtering using a fifth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a high frequency cutoff of 0.15 Hz, and variance normalization. \n\n\n\n### Estimation of dFNC and tvFNC Data \n  \nWhole brain dFNC is computed by obtaining a sequence of time domains for each of the selected 47 RSNs time-courses using the tapered sliding window approach ( ). A total of 136 widows (  W   = 136) were obtained using a rectangular window width of 22 TRs (=44 s, TR = 2 s) convolved with a Gaussian of sigma 3 TRs, and sliding in one TR step until covering the whole time domain. Then, for each subject’s windows 1 to 136, FNC among the RSN windowed time-courses was calculated generating a discrete sequence of wFNC vectors containing 1081 [=N (N−1)/2] unique FNC pairs. Each wFNC vector is then represented by a full covariance matrix named wFNC and/or dFNC matrix. Since time-courses of short length may have insufficient information to characterize full covariance matrices, the graphical LASSO algorithm ( ) was used to overcome this limitation. Covariance matrices were estimated from regularized inverse covariance matrices ( ). A penalty on the L1 norm of the precision matrix was applied to enforce sparsity. The cross-validation scheme for estimating covariance with graphical lasso framework is as follows: For each subject, a random windowed data is chosen and rest of the subject’s windowed data is considered as unseen data. The regularization parameter defined as the optimum hyperparameter lambda (among a set of lambda values selected   a priori  ) that maximizes the log likelihood of the unseen data is chosen. This process is repeated for few randomly chosen windows of the subject and the mean lambda across the repetitions is then used for estimating covariance for all of the windows of that subject. Overall 42,704 (=314 participants times 136 wFNC) dFNC matrices were obtained representing subjects’ FNC as a function of time. To account for nuisance effects, subjects’ dFNC data (zero order sliding windowed correlations) were Fisher z transformed, and residualized with respect to age, gender and multi-site ( ). Next, time derivatives of the dFNC data were computed (first order derivatives of sliding windowed correlations). Lastly, tvFNC data was formed as previously explained. \n\n\n### Clustering of dFNC and tvFNC Data \n  \nThe dFNC data was represented by five FNC states using the K-means clustering algorithm along with the correlation distance metric. The optimal number of states/clusters   k   = 5 was identifying using the elbow criterion of the cluster index ( ). To be able to compare our results to the dFNC results, the tvFNC data was clustered with the same cluster algorithm, number of clusters and distance metric. Connectivity dynamism was assessed by two measures computed from the clustering results (1) mean dwell time and (2) fraction time. Mean dwell time provides an average time an individual spend in each state before changing to another state, and fraction time provides a percentage of total time an individual spend in each state. \n\n\n### Group Differences \n  \nGroup differences in tvFNC between HC and SZ subjects were tested using two sample   t  -tests and results were corrected for multiple comparisons applying false discovery rate threshold at a significant level of   q   < 0.05. Group differences were tested for connectivity dynamism on the clustering measures, mean dwell time and fraction time; and for FNC states on all FNC pairs. In each state, first we identified subjects with at least one tvFNC element ([wFNC DwFNC]) in that state. Then, the median of all identified tvFNC elements was calculated as the subject state contribution. Therefore, the number of subjects in each state is not fixed. Next, we separate subjects’ states’ median FNC as states FNC and their corresponding derivatives. Lastly, SZ-HC group differences were tested in each state and their corresponding derivatives for each FNC pair. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Simulated dFNC Data \n  \nSimulations were designed to extend three original FNC states ( ) into five states ( ). Dynamically, the first two states show two patterns of positive and negative derivatives, and the last state show small connectivity changes across time ( ). From the Elbow plot  , we can observe that the dFNC method shows a sharp decay in the cluster index from two to three clusters. This result could imply that three could be selected as the optimal number of clusters/states. However, we can notice no changes in the cluster index for the number of clusters bigger than five. In other words, this data can be well represented by five clusters. On the other hand, the tvFNC method shows smooth cluster index decay from two to five clusters and small decline for the higher number of clusters. The tvFNC clustering results with the optimal number of clusters,   k   = 5 are shown in   (states) and   (states derivatives). These results show that the inclusion of a derivative pattern in the simulation allowed for a clearer identification of similar clusters with different temporal behavior. \n\nThe tvFNC method supports the identification of very similar states capturing different temporal behavior not shown in the dFNC method. The absence of derivatives in the clustering estimation resulted in a poor differentiation of similar states even at small noise perturbations. As in the simulation, clustering of real data analyzed in the next subsection can also benefit from the extra information provided by the derivatives. \n\n\n### Resting State fMRI Data \n  \nFunctional classification of the selected 47 RSNs is based on anatomy and brain functioning. The 47 RSNs were grouped into seven functional domains: sub-cortical [(SC), 5 RSNs]; auditory [(AUD), 2 RSNs]; visual [(VIS), 11 RSNs]; sensorimotor [(SM), 6 RSNs]; attention/cognitive control [(CC), 13 RSNs]; default mode network [(DMN), 8 RSNs]; cerebellar [(CB), 2RSNs]. Table 1 in   of the 47 RSNs along with their Brodmann area numbers, number of voxels in each components cluster, component numbers and peak activation coordinates x, y, and z.   depicts the spatial maps of the 47 RSNs grouped by seven functional domains. \n  \nSpatial Maps and their corresponding independent component numbers of the 47 selected resting state networks group into seven domains subcortical (SC), auditory (AUD), sensorimotor (SM), visual (VIS), default mode network (DMN), cerebellar (CB), and cognitive control (CC). \n  \n\n### Temporal Variation of Functional Network Connectivity Characterization \n  \nUsing sliding-window and k-means clustering whole brain temporal variation of FNC during scan duration were represented by five connectivity states.   displays the centroids of the five states broke down as FNC states 1–5 (first row) and their corresponding derivatives (second row); the total number of wFNC in each state along with its equivalent percent frequency in parenthesis is also listed. States numbering was assigned based on the order of clustering formation. States’ FNC pattern description is presented in descend order based on their wFNC frequency distribution. \n  \nFunctional network connectivity states   (A)   and their derivatives   (B)  . \n  \nState 5, the one with the higher frequency distribution (30% wFNC) shows weak connectivity overall. This state displays mostly negative correlations between domains and positive correlations within visual, cognitive control and default mode domains. The derivative of State 5 is represented by an unstructured weak connectivity pattern. Small positive and negative correlation values display a mix of increasing and decreasing connectivity. \n\nState 4, the one with the second higher frequency distribution (19% wFNC) shows slightly stronger connectivity than State 5, with higher within- and between connectivity modularity in the visual and sensorimotor domains. The derivative of State 4 is represented by a similar unstructured weak connectivity as the derivative of State 5. In addition, this state derivative displays more pronounced positive correlation values between cognitive control and visual domain can be observed. \n\nState 2, the one with the third higher frequency distribution (18% wFNC) shows a more structured connectivity pattern compared to States 4 and 5. This state captures stronger positive correlations within the visual and sensorimotor domains, and between most RSNs from the auditory, visual, and sensorimotor domains, and a few components from the cognitive control and default mode domains. We can also observe notable negative correlations between the subcortical domain and the auditory, visual, and sensorimotor domains. The derivative of State 2 is represented by a well-structured connectivity pattern displaying increase and/or decrease in connectivity within and between domains. We can observe that the marked positive and negative FNC captured in State 2 has negative and positive derivatives. These results imply that (1) there is noticeable decrease in connectivity within the visual domain and between the auditory, visual, sensorimotor and a few components from the cognitive control domains. (2) There is noticeable increase in connectivity between the subcortical, auditory, sensorimotor and some components from the cognitive control and default mode domains. \n\nState 1, the one with the second lowest frequency distribution (17% wFNC) shows weaker connectivity patterns than States 2 and 3. This state also shows noticeable positive correlations between RSNs from the default mode domain. In addition, we can observe slightly stronger negative correlations between the auditory, visual, sensorimotor, and default node domains. The derivative of State 1 is represented by weaker connectivity pattern in comparison to the derivative of State 3. \n\nWe can observe that most of the pronounced positive and negative FNC captured in State 1 has positive and negative derivatives. These results imply that (1) there is a noticeable increase in connectivity within the visual domain and between the auditory, visual, sensorimotor and a few components from the cognitive control domains. (2) There is a noticeable decrease in connectivity between the auditory, visual, and default mode domains. Also we can observe weaker decrease in connectivity between the subcortical, cognitive control, and cerebellar and the rest of domains. \n\nState 3, the one with the lowest frequency distribution (16% wFNC) shows very similar connectivity patterns as State 2. However, the derivative of State 3 is represented by a well-structured connectivity pattern very different than the derivative of State 2. The derivative of State 3 seems like the complement of the derivative of State 2 displaying increase and/or decrease in connectivity within and between domains. We can observe that the marked positive and negative FNC captured in State 3 has positive and negative derivatives. These results imply that (1) there is a noticeable increase in connectivity within the visual domain and between the auditory, visual, sensorimotor and a few components from the cognitive control and default node domains. (2) There is a noticeable decrease in connectivity between the subcortical, auditory, sensorimotor and some components from the cognitive control and default mode domains. \n\n depicts the FNC states (A) and their derivative (B) centroids separated by groups HC (first row) and SZ (second row). The total number of subjects in each state is listed in parenthesis. The HC and SZ group FNC states 1–5 and their derivatives patterns are very similar to those shown in  . State 1, the fourth state in the wFNC percent frequency rank contains the highest number of subjects [  N   = 254, HC = 127, and SZ = 127]. It is followed by State 5 [  N   = 236, HC = 109, and SZ = 127], the number one in the wFNC percent frequency rank. The HC FNC states show slightly higher positive and negative connectivity patterns than SZ states. \n  \nHealthy control (HC) and schizophrenia (SZ) participants’ functional Network connectivity states   (A)   and their derivatives   (B)  . \n  \n\n### Schizophrenia and Healthy Control Group Differences in Temporal Variation of Functional Network Connectivity \n  \nAll presented results were corrected for multiple testing. From   we can observe that HC individuals spend significantly more time in States 2 and 3. These states show stronger within- and between-connectivity in the auditory, visual, and sensorimotor domains compared to the other states. On the other hand, SZ individuals spend more time in State 5 (a state displaying weakly connectivity between RSNs from all domains). The   t  - and   p  -values are listed in  . \n  \nBar plots displaying mean dwell times in States 1–5 for HC (red) and SZ (blue) participants. The states showing significant differences between the HC and SZ groups are marked with a black star (FDR-corrected results). The two test   t  - and   p  -values are listed in  . \n    \nTwo   t  -test mean dwell time and fraction time results showing Healthy control (HC) and Schizophrenia (SZ) differences in each state. \n    \n depicts the significant connectivity differences between SZ and HC subjects in states 1–5 ( , first row) and in the states derivatives ( , second row). From  , showing FNC group differences in states 1–3 we can observe that compared to HC, SZ patients showed higher connectivity between a RSN from the subcortical domain [thalamus (IC18)] and RSNS from the auditory [superior temporal (IC58) and middle temporal gyrus (IC51)], visual [lingual gyrus (IC91), parahippocampal gyrus IC(57), middle temporal gyrus(IC42), middle frontal gyrus (IC20), cuneus (IC78), middle temporal gyrus (IC80), cuneus IC(7), superior parietal lobule (IC24)], and sensorimotor [medial frontal gyrus (IC9), right post-central gyrus (IC6)] domains. We can also notice less pronounced connectivity between RSNs from the subcortical domain and RSNs from the auditory, visual, cognitive control, and cerebellar domains in State 1; between RSNs from the subcortical and cerebellar domains and RSNs from the other domains in States 2 and 3; between subcortical, auditory, visual, cognitive control, default mode, and cerebellar domains in State 4. On the other hand, compared to SZ, HC showed higher within connectivity in the visual, sensorimotor, cognitive control domains; and among the subcortical, auditory, sensorimotor and the rest of domains. From  , we can observe FNC group differences between SZ and HC in the derivatives of states 1–3. No significant differences in the derivatives of states 4 and 5 were found. Compared to HC, SZ subjects showed higher increase in derivatives in State 1 between inferior parietal lobe (IC96, CC) and precentral gyrus (IC5, SM), middle frontal gyrus (IC21, CC); and between cingulate gyrus (IC47, CC) and anterior cingulate gyrus (IC53, DMN); in State 2 between inferior frontal gyrus (IC34, CC) and thalamus (IC18, SC), and middle frontal gyrus (IC69, DMN) and post-central gyrus (IC6, SM); and in State 3 between middle temporal gyrus (IC80, VIS), and thalamus (IC18, SC). \n  \nTwo   t  -test results showing states   (A)   and derivatives   (B)   connectivity differences between the SZ and HC groups, FDR corrected results threshold at a   q   < 0.05. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this work we have presented the tvFNC method which is an extension of the current dFNC approach to include the first derivative of the time dependent FNC patterns in the overall analysis. We found that time derivatives exhibits their own clustering patterns. The inclusion of the derivative information was useful for the clustering procedure to find an accurate clustering partition. \n\n### Clustering and tvFNC \n  \nSimulated data showed that the identification of occurring connectivity patterns performed by clustering analysis can benefit from using the first derivative information to support the existence of similar patterns with different temporal behavior. We confirm the premise that time point information can be better described, and subsequently clustered, by using its derivative. It is not the first time that derivatives are used to improve the characterization of a time varying signal. This assumption is rooted in Taylor’s theorem. Notice that due to fMRI protocols we don’t really have a continuous description of the signal. In fact, the fMRI data consists of snapshots spaced in time by a predefined TR. In the current context, we are improving the discrete time estimation of the dFNC at a given time point t = n TR by adding information of the estimated derivative DdFNC at that time point. The simulation showed that including time specific estimations of derivatives helped in recognizing the different dFNC patterns imposed in the simulation. The importance of the derivative extends to the real data where an extra set of observations can be accounted for. \n\nDynamic FNC was captured by five connectivity states that reoccurred over time supporting previous finding that whole-brain functional connectivity is not stationary ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). In addition, the dFNC states’ time derivatives provide a measure that is sensitive to dFNC changes over a period of time. These tvFNC results are also in line with previous resting state studies results examining functional disruptions in SZ. For instance, the five dFNC states identified in this study are very similar to those identified by Damaraju and collaborators ( ). In that study, the optimum number of clusters representing connectivity states was selected using the Elbow criterion. Based on this approach, five states were obtained to describe FNC over time. It can be observed in both,   here and in Damaraju et al., that States 2 and 3 are very similar. From just looking at the dFNC states results, it can be inferred that the number of FNC states can be reduced from five to four. However, the derivative patterns observed using the tvFNC method complements the results from the dFNC approach, validating the previously obtained FNC states and providing additional support for states separation. A clear state differentiation is observed from the FNC derivatives of States 2 and 3 which display different connectivity patterns,  . \n\nAnother important observation to make is that the connectivity patterns of States 2 and 3 derivatives seem to complement each other. For example, from   we observe that the derivative of State 2 shows decreasing connectivity among auditory, visual and sensorimotor domains while the derivative of State 3, shows increasing connectivity among these domains. On the other hand, the derivative of State 2 shows increasing connectivity among subcortical, auditory, visual, and sensorimotor domains while the derivative of State 3 shows decreasing connectivity among these domains. Overall, both states derivatives values are very close to zero showing almost constant (very small temporal variations) connectivity over time. \n\n\n### HC Versus SZ \n  \nIn terms of dynamism, HC changed states more than SZ subjects did. These changes were measured by computing the fraction time (FT) spend in states for the two groups. Compared to HC, SZ individuals spend significant more time in State 5, a state showing weakly dFNC and almost constant behavior over time. Lower degree of functional connectivity and reduced in modularity in SZ was also reported by  ,  , and  . The tvFNC analysis captured group differences in all five states. It also uncovered significant group differences in States 4 and 5 not previously captured ( ).   shows SZ individuals with lower connectivity than HC in states where the connectivity is already weak (States 4 and 5). These two states might be visualized as a valley or a point in time where the general connectivity lowers then rises. Since there is no significant difference in the derivatives of States 4 and 5, we can argue that spending more time in the weak states (just as SZ subjects do) allows reaching lower connectivity. On the contrary, HC dwelling is shorter and the connectivity does not reach the same minimum value. This new observation shows extra evidence that derivatives gives new refinements in the analysis. With respect to States 1, 2, and 3,   shows hyperconnectivity in SZ between the subcortical (thalamus) and RSNs from the auditory, visual and sensorimotor domains. Hypoconnectivity between (1) subcortical and cognitive control and default mode domains; (2) default mode and cognitive control domains; and (3) cerebellar and auditory, visual and sensorimotor, cognitive control domains is also observed. These states (1, 2, and 3) suffer more sudden and faster changes, thus the dynamics are different than States 4 and 5. Note that, a similar pattern of hypoconnectivity within auditory and visual domains can be seen in all five states which is consistent with the disconnection hypothesis ( ). Results seem in higher agreement with the disconnection hypothesis since some dFNC has slower dynamicity as seen in  ,   where some derivatives exhibit lower magnitudes in SZ. \n\nIn a compensatory manner, thalamic connectivity is stronger in SZ as it is the main characteristic shared by states 1, 2, and 3. Although this observation seems contrary to Friston’s disconnection hypothesis, it is not a rare observation. Resting-state fMRI studies have reported SZ thalamic hyperconnectivity with sensorimotor cortices, whole brain ( ;  ;  ) and seed-based ( ;  ). To counterbalance the previous statement, we must point out that thalamic hyperconnectivity pertain to states with short dwelling while larger dwelling states characterizes the absence of this hyperconnectivity (see  ,  ). However, sensorial hypoconnectivity (auditory, visual and sensorimotor) can be found in all states, thus present 100 % of the time. \n\nThe novel contributions of this work are the differences in dynamicity, as measured using the derivatives of dFNC.   displays states derivative differences’ between SZ and HC. Group differences were captured in three out of the five states among six domains. Compared to HC, SZ subjects showed higher increase in derivatives in State 1 between inferior parietal lobe and, precentral gyrus and middle frontal gyrus; and cingulate gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus. In State 2 between inferior frontal gyrus and thalamus; and middle frontal gyrus and post-central gyrus. In State 3 between middle temporal gyrus and thalamus. Despite these increments in variation, the connectivity strength was not different for the mentioned IC pairs in States 2 and 3. This can be observed by comparing the mentioned derivatives in   with the connectivity in  . This observation is not consistent since we could expect that higher derivatives would help increasing the magnitude of connectivity. Since this was not the case, we can conclude that the aggregated effect of the increased derivatives was not coherent or not strong enough to produce a consistent difference in connectivity. However, the observation points to a more rapid connectivity fluctuation in CC and DMN brain areas pointing to possible causes of cognitive deficiencies known to occur in schizophrenia ( ). \n\n\n### Limitations and Future Directions \n  \nAmong the limitations to be consider in this work: Functional connectivity is measured as the Pearson correlation between fMRI time-courses, and this lower order statistic provided significant results. Higher order statistics, such as mutual information, could be considered in future work to extend this analysis. The calculation of dFNC data requires a window length selection. The selected windowed size should be able to capture functional connectivity variability in small time domains ( ). Following this recommendation, a fixed window size of 22 TR (=44 s) similar to the one used in   was selected. Future work should evaluate state derivative changes over range of window sizes. Another limitation lies on the scan duration. This resting state fMRI data was collected for 5.4 min, a longer scanning time may uncover the identification of critical time points where FNC states reaches stationary behavior. \n\n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nParticipants’ scan and information collection was approved by all seven sites’ institutional review boards (IRB).

Alteration in brain functional connectivity (FC) is expected to provide potential biomarkers for classifying or predicting brain disorders. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review in order to provide guidance about the available brain FC measures and typical classification strategies. We survey the state-of-the-art FC analysis methods including widely used static functional connectivity (SFC) and more recently proposed dynamic functional connectivity (DFC). Temporal correlations among regions of interest (ROIs), data-driven spatial network and functional network connectivity (FNC) are often computed to reflect SFC from different angles. SFC can be extended to DFC using a sliding-window framework, and intrinsic connectivity states along the time-varying connectivity patterns are typically extracted using clustering or decomposition approaches. We also briefly summarize window-less DFC approaches. Subsequently, we highlight various strategies for feature selection including the filter, wrapper and embedded methods. In terms of model building, we include traditional classifiers as well as more recently applied deep learning methods. Moreover, we review representative applications with remarkable classification accuracy for psychosis and mood disorders, neurodevelopmental disorder, and neurological disorders using fMRI data. Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are discussed. Finally, challenges in the field are pointed out with respect to the inaccurate diagnosis labeling, the abundant number of possible features and the difficulty in validation. Some suggestions for future work are also provided. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nBrain disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) are considered in terms of disruptions of the normal-range operation of brain functions. While psychiatric disorders are diagnosed based on symptom scores from clinical interview, there are no existing gold standards that can be used for definitive validation. Brain functional neuroimaging techniques including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Lee et al.,  ; Power et al.,  ), positron emission tomography (PET), and electroencephalography (EEG) have become important tools in investigating brain disease (Abi-Dargham and Horga,  ). There is much hope that brain functional connectivity revealed using functional neuroimaging data can be used to characterize brain function abnormality and in turn benefit diagnosis and treatment (Deco and Kringelbach,  ). Among diverse modalities, fMRI enables non-invasive investigation of brain function with high spatial resolution and has been widely used to detect and characterize brain networks or connectivity among functionally interconnected regions. Investigating differences in functional network (or connectivity) between disorders such as SZ and BP may provide new insights into their disease mechanisms (Birur et al.,  ). Furthermore, the identified changes in connectivity measures may be useful as biomarkers which can be employed to classify individual patients using machine learning methods (Arbabshirani et al.,  ; Stephan et al.,  ). In this paper, we restrict our review to fMRI data, but some methods are able to be easily expanded to other brain functional imaging modalities as well. \n\nThere have been a variety of methods proposed to measure functional connectivity (FC) among brain regions using fMRI data (Van Den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol,  ; Smith et al.,  ; Calhoun and De Lacy,  ). While different approaches have different assumptions and advantages, a detailed review is important to help us understand the ways in which these approaches have been used. How to select features from a large amount of measures as biomarker for building model to classify or predict brain disorders is an important and challenging problem. Classification and prediction are two forms of analysis which are used for building models to separate classes and to predict future outcomes. Generally, classification is to classify categorical disease labels that have been already acquired concurrently with or prior to the scan, while prediction is to predict unknown disease labels, future progression, or continuous-valued functions. Compared with classification, prediction is harder but more promising for clinical utility. In the context of neuroimaging, although increasing studies have tended to shift their concentration to the prediction problem, the majority of previous studies on brain disorders focused on identifying neuromarkers for classifying different groups. In this paper, we primarily aim to present a comprehensive review summarizing various brain functional connectivity measures and typical classification strategies, in order to provide guidance in this field. It is worth noting that most of the measures and strategies used in the classification problem can also be applied or extended to the prediction problem. We also survey recent exciting applications that employed fMRI data to differentiate mental disorders and other brain diseases. The challenges and difficulties as well as potential solutions are pointed out in the end. \n\n\n## Functional connectivity measures from fMRI data \n  \nFunctional connectivity reflects the organization and inter-relationship of spatially separated brain regions. Methods for measuring and delineating functional connectivity play a key role, since the used measures may greatly affect the identification of biomarkers and the accuracy of individual-subject classification and prediction. Typically, functional connectivity is assumed to be stationary over the scanning time (usually several minutes), and most previous fMRI studies applied a static functional connectivity (SFC) analysis. Until recently, more emerging exciting work have proven that regarding brain functional connectivity as dynamic over time can be successful in uncovering the disruptions to the normal human brain in disease condition (Calhoun et al.,  ). Figure   summarizes the primary functional connectivity analysis methods and possible connectivity features used for classification/prediction problem. \n  \nThe primary functional connectivity analysis methods and possible connectivity features used for classification/prediction problem. \n  \n### Static functional connectivity analyses \n  \nFrom a view of methodology, there are generally three kinds of strategies analyzing SFC (Calhoun and De Lacy,  ). The first is a model-driven strategy which uses prior knowledge to decide sets of brain regions/voxels and then limit connectivity analysis to some specific regions/voxels. The second approach is more data-driven and maps whole brain functional networks using decomposition or clustering methods. In such case, brain voxels assigned to the same component or cluster reflect regions which are highly correlated. The third combines the idea of the above two strategies, which firstly extracts co-activated regions using a data-driven method and then estimates functional connectivity among the regions. We outline several typical methods as below. \n\n#### Model-driven analysis for assessing connectivity among regions or seeds \n  \nBrain functional connectivity analysis among   a priori   regions of interest (ROIs) or voxels (Poldrack,  ) is the most widely applied model-driven method. Three key steps include the determination of locations and shapes of ROIs or the locations of voxels, the computation of representative time series of ROIs or voxels, and the assessment of connectivity (or coupling) among different ROIs or connectivity between each seed (ROI or voxel) and all other voxels within brain. As such, the resulting functional connectivity strengths reflect the temporal fluctuation relations among the selected voxels or regions. ROI-based functional connectivity strengths can be easily taken as features in classification and prediction problems, since the corresponding connectivity features of a new/testing subject can be directly computed between the brain regions (or voxels) selected using the training subjects. While ROIs and voxels are usually determined by subjective experience and prior knowledge, the resulting functional connectivity can be greatly sensitive to the empirical selection and show a very different pattern for small changes in the ROIs. Hence, how to decide a reasonable region including voxels with consistent brain function is a challenge. Considerable research work (Thirion et al.,  ; Glasser et al.,  ) has attempted to delineate a parcellation of brain by employing information of multiple modalities of imaging, however, inconsistencies still exists. The representative time series of voxels in one region can be calculated as the mean of all voxels' time series or the first principal component of all voxels' time series using principal component analysis (PCA). Although averaging and PCA can decrease the noise effect in the representative time series of ROIs to some extent, the obtained functional connectivity can still be related to noise. Functional connectivity between two representative time series is mostly estimated by computing correlations to measure their linear relationship, but also can be assessed by mutual information to identify non-linear relationships (Wang et al.,  ). Coherence estimates the linear relationship in the frequency domain (Sun et al.,  ), and connectivity within a specific frequency can be achieved by methods such as wavelet decomposition (Skidmore et al.,  ). It is worth noting that different measurements may reflect disparate connectivity meaning. In addition to the above computation steps, different preprocessing strategies also could affect the resulting functional connectivity strengths. Whether regressing out global mean is a controversial issue (Murphy et al.,  ; Hayasaka,  ) and how to remove out head motion also deserve further investigation (Friston et al.,  ; Power et al.,  ). These shortcomings should be carefully addressed while conducting analyses using the method. \n\n\n#### Data-driven analysis for estimating spatial functional network maps \n  \nIn contrast to model-driven methods, data-driven approaches estimating functional networks do not require the specification of predefined brain regions or voxels. These popular approaches include spatial independent component analysis (ICA) (Calhoun et al.,  ; Calhoun and Adali,  ; Du and Fan,  ; Du et al.,  ; Calhoun and De Lacy,  ), principle component analysis (PCA), and clustering methods (Van Den Heuvel et al.,  ; Du et al.,  ). In particular, ICA is a widely used approach that has shown great promise in identifying network-based biomarkers of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) (Garrity et al.,  ; Ongür et al.,  ; Calhoun et al.,  ; Khadka et al.,  ; Meda et al.,  ; Du et al.,  ,  ). Spatial ICA of an individual-subject's fMRI data decomposes the fMRI data matrix (time points × voxels) into a linear combination of multiple maximally spatially independent components (ICs), of which meaningful ICs can be regarded as brain functional networks. In each network, the voxels with greater Z-scores tend to have higher intra-connectivity (or co-activation) (Du et al.,  ) and can be interpreted as a weighted seed maps (Joel et al.,  ). The mixing matrix in the decomposition includes the time series of the ICs, where each time series reflects the temporal fluctuation of each IC. In addition to less prior knowledge needed in advance, other advantages of ICA relative to the ROI-based method include (1) simultaneous estimation of multiple networks from whole-brain data, (2) overlapping components, which provide a spatial filtering of artifacts (Sochat et al.,  ; Du Y. H. et al.,  ) or potentially interesting overlapping networks (Xu et al.,  ), and (3) adaptivity of components among subjects, allowing for inter-subject variability in regions to be captured (Allen et al.,  ). \n\nThe primary shortcoming of applying ICA on fMRI data is that ICA generates ICs in an arbitrary order. To solve the problem, two strategies are typically adopted in fMRI studies with multiple subjects (Calhoun et al.,  ) to make ICs of different subjects comparable. The first strategy is to perform ICA for each subject separately, and then establish correspondence of ICs across subjects using methods such as subjective identification (McKeown et al.,  ; Calhoun,  ), clustering (Moritz et al.,  ; Esposito et al.,  ; De Martino et al.,  ), and automated matching based on reproducibility (Yang et al.,  ). These methods could be sensitive to different source separations in multiple ICA decompositions of different subjects. For instance, one single IC detected for a certain subject may be split into several ICs including smaller active areas with closely related time courses for other subjects (McKeown et al.,  ), making it difficult if not impossible to establish correspondence among ICs of different subjects. The second strategy, often referred to as group ICA, implements one ICA on all subjects' data and then obtains subject-specific ICs from the group-level ICs somehow, which establishes direct correspondence of ICs across different subjects. The fMRI data of multiple subjects are typically grouped in three different ways with distinct hypotheses imposed upon multi-subject fMRI data, including spatial concatenation, temporal concatenation, and tensor organization. The spatial concatenation method concatenates multi-subject fMRI data along the spatial dimension supposing that corresponding ICs of all subjects have common temporal information (Svensén et al.,  ). The more frequently applied temporal concatenation method concatenates the multi-subject fMRI data along the temporal dimension (Calhoun et al.,  ,  ; Beckmann et al.,  ), followed by estimation of single-subject maps and time courses using an approach called back-reconstruction which includes PCA-based methods (Calhoun et al.,  ), spatio-temporal (dual)-regression (Beckmann et al.,  ; Erhardt et al.,  ) and group information guided ICA (GIG-ICA) (Du and Fan,  ; Du et al.,  ,  ; Du Y. H. et al.,  ). Each of these can be considered as providing a different balance between ensuring matches via a group model and allowing individual subject variability to be captured. GIG-ICA is one of the more flexible approaches and estimates the subject-specific ICs by optimizing the independence measure of multiple ICs for each subject while preserving the correspondence of ICs across different subjects. GIG-ICA has been shown to well represent individual subject maps and provides an improved approach for addressing individual subject artifacts than single-subject ICA followed by group ICA (Du and Fan,  ; Du Y. H. et al.,  ). The tensor probabilistic ICA method stacks the original multi-subject fMRI data along a separate third dimension with a hypothesis that different subjects have common group spatial ICs and time courses but subject specific loading parameters (Beckmann and Smith,  ; Lee et al.,  ). \n\nIndependent vector analysis (IVA) is another method which optimizes the independence among each subject's components and the dependence among corresponding components of different subjects. Several advancements of IVA have been made for achieving reliable source separation for linearly dependent Gaussian and non-Gaussian sources (Anderson et al.,  ; Dea et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Adali et al.,  ; Anderson M. et al.,  ; Boukouvalas et al.,  ). Among those, IVA-GL, which is a combination of two IVA algorithms, IVA with multivariate Gaussian component vectors (IVA-G) (Anderson et al.,  ) and IVA with multivariate Laplace component vectors (IVA-L) (Lee et al.,  ), provides an attractive tradeoff in terms of complexity and performance. A direct comparison of IVA and GIG-ICA was performed in recent work (Du et al.,  ) which emphasized the advantages of the two approaches. For sources with slight or moderate inter-subject spatial variability, GIG-ICA obtained components with higher accuracy than IVA. For datasets where all subjects had a subject-unique source with large inter-subject spatial variability, IVA showed better performance in the component/time courses (TC) accuracy of the unique source, although GIG-ICA in general still performed better for other subject-common sources compared to IVA. Therefore, a framework that leverages the strengths of IVA and GIG-ICA is expected to achieve high accuracy for both subject-common and subject-unique networks. \n\nIt is also well-acknowledged that another pitfall of data-driven approaches (Calhoun and De Lacy,  ) is the requirement to select a certain model order (e.g., the number of components in decomposition methods or the number of clusters in clustering methods) that may greatly affect the resulting brain network maps. While employing ICA to extract functional networks, the number of components is typically estimated using information-theoretic principles, such as a modified minimum description length (MDL) criteria (Li et al.,  ). Since different estimation methods result in different numbers of components (Zuo et al.,  ), it is important to consider the impact of the model order. Moreover, it is likely that a single model order is not the best solution, rather one can consider evaluating the impact of a range of model orders which enables a hierarchical evaluation of the brain's spatial organization (Ma et al.,  ; Calhoun and De Lacy,  ). \n\nIt is known that features are required to be comparable across subjects for the purpose of classification or prediction. In decomposition-based methods, how to propagate components (indicating functional networks) to a new subject that is not included in the original training set is an important issue. In the case of applying individual ICA on each subject separately, the obtained components from each coming subject have to be well-matched with the components from the training set using some matching rules so that their used features are consistent. In group ICA framework, there are several ways to do this, one can use spatio-temporal regression to generate spatial and temporal features from new subjects (Erhardt et al.,  ). Another approach is to use spatially constrained ICA (Lin et al.,  ; Du and Fan,  ; Du et al.,  ,  ; Du Y. H. et al.,  ). The latter approach is more optimal as individual data sets will have results that are optimized for independence, and will also provide spatial and temporal features that are adapted to each individual subject. A classification study using this framework can be found in Du et al. ( ). \n\n\n#### Functional network connectivity analysis \n  \nFunctional network connectivity (FNC) (Jafri et al.,  ; Allen et al.,  ) analysis employs a strategy that combines model-driven and data-driven methods. The framework typically includes two steps. It first performs group ICA on fMRI data of multiple subjects, resulting in subject-specific functional networks (indicated by ICs) and their associated fluctuations (reflected by TCs). Then, the connectivity between any two networks can be obtained by computing connectivity measure such as Pearson correlation between their post-processed TCs, resulting in a connectivity matrix including connectivity strengths among all networks. Similar to the ROI-based method, FNC also reflects temporal connectivity among different brain regions. The difference between the ROI-based and FNC method is that a data-driven method is applied to fMRI data in the FNC analysis to generate brain regions that are functionally co-activated (i.e., regions in one network), while in ROI-based method brain regions are usually decided via prior knowledge (e.g., brain atlas) rather than using the in-house fMRI data. Similar to ICA, it is necessary to determine the number of components in advance in the FNC method. FNC approaches typically use, a high model order (e.g., 100 or larger) to provide a more detailed parcellation of the brain. \n\n\n#### Other functional connectivity measures \n  \nIn addition to the typical approaches for assessing functional connectivity (e.g. correlation) other meaningful measurements have also been proposed. For example, the regional homogeneity (ReHo) (Zang et al.,  ) has been proposed to reflect regional functional connectivity (or co-activation) where Kendall's coefficient concordance (KCC) is used to measure the similarity of the time series of a given voxel to those of its nearest neighbors. A similar approach is Cohe-ReHo (Liu et al.,  ) computed based on coherence metrics. Regional connectivity may serve as features for differentiating patients and healthy controls. Moreover, after functional connectivity matrices are obtained from either model-driven or data-driven techniques, graph-theory derived metrics (Liu et al.,  ; Lynall et al.,  ; Yu Q. et al.,  ) such as the averaged node strength, clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and local efficiency (Rubinov and Sporns,  ) can be calculated. These graph-based measures provide powerful features which integrate across the whole brain and can be used in classifying and predicting individual patients. \n\n\n\n### Dynamic (time-resolved) functional connectivity analyses \n  \nAll of the above mentioned analysis approaches estimate brain functional connectivity by computing an average of the full time series (e.g., computing Pearson correlation between two ROIs using BOLD signals within 5 or 10 min) and generate a static value to reflect the connection strength. In recent years, there have been much interests in computing time-resolved connectivity measures and successful applications in identifying biomarkers from dynamic connectivity (Chang and Glover,  ; Sakoglu et al.,  ; Allen et al.,  ; Zalesky et al.,  ; Du et al.,  ; Sadaghiani et al.,  ; Du Y. H. et al.,  ). In such analysis, brain functional connectivity can vary within a short period (e.g., tens of seconds) rather than be considered as static over time. Such results tend to further expand the available information, and avoid the strong assumption that brain activity is static over time. \n\nWhile dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) has emerged as a promising topic in the recent fMRI literature, there are also some critical comments on the theory of dynamic connectivity. Laumann et al. ( ) suggested that correlations measured by resting-state BOLD are relatively stable over short timescales and may not reflect moment-to-moment changes in cognitive content. Though this issue is still not completely settled, many new studies have shown a relationship between behavior, emotion, and cognition during rest with dynamic connectivity features, giving us confidence in its potential utility. In addition, since dynamic connectivity has shown to be a useful tool for identifying biomarkers, we introduce some typical approaches and applications in terms of dynamic connectivity. \n\n#### Sliding time-window based dynamic connectivity analysis \n  \nThere are numerous methods which can be used to estimate DFC (Calhoun et al.,  ; Chen J. E. et al.,  ; Preti et al.,  ). The sliding time-window technique (Sakoglu et al.,  ; Hutchison et al.,  ; Hindriks et al.,  ; Shakil et al.,  ) is the most widely used. By assessing functional connectivity in different time-windows, one can easily expand existing static connectivity strategies to be time-resolved. DFC can then be evaluated by measuring functional connectivity among ROIs or voxels in a sliding window yielding multiple connectivity matrices (Du Y. H. et al.,  ; Du et al.,  , ), performing ICA (or IVA) on fMRI data in different windows to generate dynamic spatial network patterns (Kiviniemi et al.,  ), or segmenting time series of networks (i.e., ICs) into short time series and then computing time-varying FNC (Allen et al.,  ). The sliding-window technique has also been applied to evaluate ReHo and brain graph, yielding time-varying ReHo values (Deng et al.,  ) and time-varying graphs (Yu Q. B. et al.,  ; Du Y. H. et al.,  ). \n\nDynamic connectivity analyses among brain regions and networks have attracted increasing interests. Various approaches to further investigate the time-varying connectivity patterns is a topic of ongoing work. Different connectivity states, reflecting specific configurations of connected regions, can be revealed by   post-hoc   analyses of dynamic connectivity (Calhoun et al.,  ; Damaraju et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ; Du et al.,  ,  ; Yu Q. B. et al.,  ; Du Y. H. et al.,  ). Therefore, changes in connectivity states among different clinical populations might provide unique or additional biomarkers of disorders not detectable with SFC measures. Researchers have applied clustering (Allen et al.,  ; Du Y. H. et al.,  ), principal components analysis (PCA) (Leonardi et al.,  ), Fisher discrimination dictionary learning (FDDL) (Li et al.,  ), and spatial and temporal independent components analysis (ICA) (Yaesoubi et al.,  ; Miller et al.,  ) to extract connectivity states. These methods typically estimate connectivity states with discrepant patterns due to their different assumptions (Calhoun et al.,  ). Clustering approaches may fail to converge when working on “noisy” data that do not necessarily have desirable distributions. A more serious shortcoming of clustering is that the method always can yield a partition with any given number of clusters, regardless if the used features show patterns indicating clusters. The above mentioned decomposition-based work (Leonardi et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Yaesoubi et al.,  ; Miller et al.,  ) focuses on group-level connectivity states that are common across subjects. One can also use GIG-ICA to estimate connectivity states at both group-level and subject-level (Du et al.,  , ). The method first computes the group-level connectivity states by analyzing multiple subjects' dynamic connectivity, and then guided by the group-level states it correspondingly estimates the subject-specific connectivity states that are independent from each other. \n\nThere has been considerable work using DFC analyses to investigate impairments in schizophrenia-spectrum and mood disorders (Damaraju et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ; Du Y. H. et al.,  ; Du et al.,  , ) as well as classifying individual patients based on DFC measures (Rashid et al.,  ). Damaraju et al. ( ) computed dynamic FNC matrices of healthy controls (HCs) and SZ patients, and then clustered the time-varying FNC into different states, suggesting that states exhibiting cortical-subcortical negative connectivity and strong positive connectivity between sensory networks are those that show the group differences of thalamic hyperconnectivity and sensory hypoconnectivity. Rashid et al. ( ) also analyzed dynamic DFC of SZ patients and BP patients using a clustering method, and found that SZ patients showed more changes than BP subjects, including both hyper and hypo connectivity in one common connectivity state. Du Y. H. et al. ( ) estimated dynamic connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) of 82 HCs and 82 SZ patients using a ROI-based method, and then applied K-means to extract connectivity states. The results showed that HCs spent more time in a state that reflected stronger connectivity between anterior and posterior brain regions, while SZ patients spent more time in a disconnected state. Another study (Du et al.,  ) extracted connectivity states from whole-brain ROI-based DFC of 238 HCs, 140 bipolar disorder with psychosis (BPP), 132 schizoaffective disorder (SAD) and 113 SZ patients using GIG-ICA. Results showed that DFC provided more informative measures than the SFC method. Diagnosis-related connectivity states were evident using DFC analysis. For the dominant state consistent across groups, 22 instances of hypoconnectivity (with decreasing trends from HC to BPP to SAD to SZ) mainly involving post-central, frontal and cerebellar cortices as well as 34 examples of hyperconnectivity (with increasing trends from HC to BPP to SAD to SZ) primarily involving thalamus and temporal cortices were found. Interestingly, hypoconnectivities/hyperconnectivities also showed negative/positive correlations, respectively, with clinical symptom scores. Regarding frontal connectivities, BPP resembled HC while SAD and SZ were more similar. Using a similar framework, whole-brain DFC from resting-state fMRI data of 70 HCs, 53 individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis, and 58 early illness schizophrenia (ESZ) patients were utilized to estimate the inherent connectivity states, and then group differences were identified (Du et al.,  ). The work found widespread connectivity alterations in both CHR and ESZ groups, and ESZ patients generally showed more connectivity differences with larger changes than CHR individuals relative to controls. Inspired by these studies, we believe that changes of connections within states, temporal measures such as dwell time in different states, as well as disease-specific states in dynamic connectivity analysis are able to provide interesting features for classification of diseases in future. \n\nFurthermore, the time-varying patterns in brain activity and their relationships with time-varying brain connectivity are also important for advancing our understanding of brain networks and the underlying mechanism of brain dynamics. A recent study (Fu et al.,  ) developed a framework based on the sliding window approach for characterizing time-varying brain activity and exploring its associations with time-varying brain connectivity. This framework was applied to a resting-state fMRI dataset including 151 SZ patients and 163 age- and gender-matched HCs, suggesting that amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and FNC were correlated along time and these relationships are significantly changed in SZ. \n\n\n#### Windowless methods for extracting dynamic connectivity \n  \nThe above mentioned sliding time-window methods have been extensively used and are successful to estimate dynamic connectivity. However, there is an apparent limit in lacking standards for setting the window length, although previous studies have suggested 30–60 s of window length that are feasible in capturing DFC (Zalesky and Breakspear,  ). If the window length is too short, the time points in each window could be too few to generate robust estimation of connectivity strengths. In contrast, long window length might decrease the temporal variations of functional connectivity, consequently hindering from detecting effective connectivity states. \n\nSeveral windowless-based methods have been proposed to avoid the problem in selecting the window length. The recently proposed time-frequency analysis (Yaesoubi et al.,  ) explored the connectivity by using multiple frequencies, which can be conceptually seen as adapting the observation window to the frequency content of the original time courses. Bayesian approach (Robinson et al.,  ; Taghia et al.,  ) has also been employed to study dynamic connectivity, which regards extracting time-varying functional networks as selecting dynamic models in the Bayesian setting. More recently, a new approach (Yaesoubi et al.,  ) was proposed to estimate DFC with the main advantage of capturing connectivity with arbitrary rates of change. In the approaches based on windowing operation, observable rate of change is driven by the length of the window, but in this approach there is no requirement for a windowing operation. \n\n\n\n\n## Classification or prediction strategies \n  \nBrain disorders cause serious impairments or debilitating behavior and represent a major health and financial burden globally (Vigo et al.,  ). In the United States, brain disorders (such as the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments) are typically defined using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) (American Psychiatric Association,  ). There are also some alternatives offer standard criteria for the classification of brain disorders, such as ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders, produced by the world health organization (WHO). However, over the years new knowledge is continuously added, resulting in changes in the diagnosis and disease classification (e.g., some are not valid, some are changed, and new ones appear). In addition, many mental illnesses are diagnosed based largely on symptoms, rather than biological criteria. More recently, there has been a focus on the importance of looking across disorders and also on continuous measures of assessment in both health and disease, e.g., the research domain criterion (RDoC) (Insel and Cuthbert,  ). In this context, there has been an increasing trend to identify biological markers. Brain functional connectivity has been of great interest in the search for markers of numerous brain disorders. In the following, we will review some commonly used feature selection and classification (or prediction) strategies in fMRI functional connectivity based brain disorder studies. Several key aspects of feature selection methods and classifiers are compared and their promise and pitfall are discussed. \n\n### Feature selection strategies \n  \nThe properties of fMRI data make feature selection especially important in the classification and prediction (Van Schooten et al.,  ). The dimension of functional connectivity is large even if ones only evaluate connectivity between defined ROIs. If the functional connectivity is calculated between voxels, the number of features will go up (potentially millions of features). Functional connectivity relating to a specific brain disorder often focuses on a small portion of all possible connections/associations. In that case, if all functional connections are used as features in a classifier, it would cause an overfitting problem since algorithm tries to fit the classifier to every feature even the irrelevant ones. If the classifier variables are overfitted to the training samples, they might work poorly on the samples not in the training sets, resulting in unsatisfied performance in classification. Another problem is that functional connectivity might provide substantial redundant information for classification. Using all connections as features with redundant information might be detrimental to the results of classification. Considering this, it is important to incorporate good feature selection strategies to identify appropriate functional connectivity features for the classification of brain disorders. Table   summarize the properties of different feature selection methods. \n  \nSummary of the feature selection methods. \n  \n#### Filter methods \n  \nA widely applied feature selection strategy is filter-based method, where feature selection is independent from classifier/model building (Guyon and Elisseeff,  ). They use the general characteristics of dataset and assign proxy measures to features from which a number of features with top scores are selected. A good filter method is sensitive to the discretionary power so as to suppress the least interesting features. The most popular filter method is to use group-level statistical tests. Generally, functional connectivity with group difference are first identified using different statistical tests such as   t  -test, Welch's   t  -test and ranksum-test and then these functional connections are used as input features of classification approaches (Calhoun et al.,  ; Anderson et al.,  ; Bassett et al.,  ; Du et al.,  ; Arbabshirani et al.,  ; Fekete et al.,  ; Guo H. et al.,  ; Dyrba et al.,  ). A major problem with this strategy is that group difference is sometimes investigated using whole data (Arbabshirani et al.,  ). That is, the label information for testing samples is used for feature selection, which will result in biased classification results. Another issue is that features are often selected based on their   p  -values. However, functional connectivities which show small   p  -values for group comparisons do not necessarily reflect those with the largest discrimination power. One previous study in our group has shown that features can have different distributions but comparable group means for different cohorts (Arbabshirani et al.,  ). This type of features might have a large   p  -value of statistical tests but good classification performance. There are also other filter methods used in the classification of brain disorders. Fisher score is a univariate feature selection algorithm which has been applied to determine the discriminatory power of features between two groups with equal probability (Gu et al.,  ; Khazaee et al.,  ). Correlation-based feature selection (CFS) is a simple algorithm which ranks features based on a hypothesis that good feature subsets contain features highly correlated with the classification (Hall,  ; Shen et al.,  ; Tang et al.,  ; Su et al.,  ; Challis et al.,  ). RELIEF based algorithms are another large family of filter methods which estimate the scores of features according to how well their values distinguish between instances (Kira and Rendell,  ). These methods are not dependent on heuristics, run in low-order polynomial time, and are noise-tolerant and robust to feature interactions, as well as being applicable for binary or continuous data (Kira and Rendell,  ). The minimum redundancy, maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm has also been used for the feature selection (Lord et al.,  ). This method uses each feature's predictive power and the mutual information between features to rank the most relevant features. mRMR can achieve satisfactory results compared with an exhaustive search, without the increase in time cost for ordering the feature list. The major advantages of filter methods are their effectiveness in computation time and their robustness to overfitting (Hamon,  ). However, filter methods also have several drawbacks. First, the features selected by filter methods are not optimized to suit any specific classifier. Secondly, some of the filter methods tend to select redundant features since they ignore the relationships between features. \n\n\n#### Wrapper methods and embedded methods \n  \nWrapper methods, which involve optimizing classifiers as part of the feature selection, have also been used in the classification (Guyon and Elisseeff,  ; Fan et al.,  ; Venkataraman et al.,  ; Yu Y. et al.,  ). Generally, wrapper methods use classifiers or predictive model to rank features. This class of methods evaluates the classification performance of different combinations of features and tries to identify the optimal subset of features that can provide the largest discriminatory power. Since the number of possible feature combinations grows exponentially as the number of features increase, customizable heuristics and termination-conditions are typically employed in wrapper methods to avoid that the selection of features is beyond a computer's processing power. Various wrapper methods have been employed in the brain disorders classification studies. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) is the most popular used wrapper method which selects features by recursively considering smaller and smaller combinations of features (Castro et al.,  ,  ; Ladha and Deepa,  ; Colby et al.,  ; Dai D. et al.,  ; Du et al.,  ). This algorithm trains classifiers using the initial set of features and ranks the features according to their importance. The least important features are then discarded and the procedure is recursively repeated using the remaining features until a pre-desired number of features is select. Another widely used wrapper method is the genetic algorithm (GA) family, which uses binary encoding and specific mutation for feature selections (Yang and Honavar,  ). Initially, binary encoded subsets of predictors (a feature is either included or not in the subset) are created and their corresponding fitness values, such as classification accuracy, are calculated. The encoded subsets then undergo cross-over and are subject to random mutations. This process is repeated again and again to create better subsets of predictors. Wrapper methods tend to select better performing features than filter methods and can provide the best feature selections specific for a particular type of classifier. However, wrapper methods also have two major shortcomings. First, wrapper methods might overfit if the number of observations is not large. And secondly, wrapper methods are computationally much more expensive since they need to create classifiers recursively. \n\nEmbedded methods, which combine classification and feature selection into the decision process, have also been applied to classification (Lal et al.,  ). Embedded methods are similar to wrapper methods since both of them incorporate feature selection into the classifier construction process. However, wrapper methods use a learning machine to measure the quality of subsets of features without incorporating knowledge about the specific structure of the classification or regression function; therefore they can combine with any learning machine. In embedded methods, the learning part and the feature selection part cannot be separated. An intrinsic model building metric is used during the learning process for embedded methods in which the feature selections are specific to given learning machines. A common category of embedded methods is using a regularization penalty to enforce the sparsity of features in order to identify features with more discriminatory power. The most popular embedded method with regularization penalty is the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method (Tibshirani,  ; Jie et al.,  ; Watanabe et al.,  ; Rosa et al.,  ; Fonti and Belitser,  ). The LASSO method builds a linear model and penalizes the regression weights using L1 penalty. Amount of weights are shrunk to zero and those features with non-zero weights are selected finally. Ridge regression is another embedded method used for the feature selection (Yu and Liu,  ; Ng,  ). Similar to LASSO method, ridge regression shrinks the regression weights by incorporating a penalty. However, the ridge penalty behaves differently than LASSO penalty. The ridge penalty would be more likely to select features with high correlations than the LASSO penalty and tend to provide better classification performance. The elastic net algorithm is an extension of LASSO (Zou and Hastie,  ; Gheiratmand et al.,  ; Teipel et al.,  ). It overcomes LASSO limitations on the feature number selections and the stabilization of feature selection by using a combination of LASSO and ridge regression methods. Since embedded methods select features specific to the classifiers, they are much faster and less computationally expensive. \n\n\n\n### Classification and prediction models \n  \n#### Traditional classifiers \n  \nA wide range of classifiers has been applied in the classification of brain disorders. Support vector machine (SVM) is so far the most popular method (Lord et al.,  ; Anderson and Cohen,  ; Yu Y. et al.,  ; Watanabe et al.,  ; Du et al.,  ; Dyrba et al.,  ; Khazaee et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ; Sacchet et al.,  ; Cabral et al.,  ). SVM is a type of supervised learning classifier with learning algorithms used for classification and regression (Cortes and Vapnik,  ). Standard SVM is a binary classifier which generalizes the optimally separating hyperplane to better separate different groups of data. The basic idea of SVM is to find an observation of one class which is closest to an observation from the other class. The hyperplane is drawn in a way that maximizes the distance between these observations so that the hyperplane can separate the observations into different sides. Since a “slack variable” is used in the SVM classifier, SVM allows overlaps between different groups. There is no assumption needed for the SVM classifier, making it a very flexible method. However, it is also hard to interpret the results from SVM compared with the other traditional classifiers. The original SVM classifier is a linear classifier. By incorporating the different kernel functions to maximum-margin hyperplanes, SVM can become non-linear classifiers. The kernel functions transfer the original features space to a higher-dimensional feature space so that the algorithm can fit the maximum-margin hyperplane in a new feature space. Several common kernels are widely used in SVM, such as polynomial kernel, sigmoid kernel, and Gaussian RBF kernel. The choice of kernel is crucial for building a successful SVM-based classifier. Different types of the kernel will be suitable for different studies depending on the characteristics of features. SVM with different kernels will have different hyperparameters needed to be optimized. For example, SVM with linear kernel has only one hyperparameter to be adjusted which is called soft margin. In addition, SVM approaches using non-linear kernels have one or more additional hyperparameters to be tuned. The optimization of hyperparameters is usually based on a grid search over pre-provided candidate values. It is very important in SVM as these parameters significantly influence classification performance and accuracy. \n\nLinear discriminant analysis (LDA) is another widely used classifier (Dai Z. et al.,  ; Cetin et al.,  ; De Marco et al.,  ; Qureshi et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ), which projects features into a lower-dimensional space in which different groups of data can be maximally separately (Altman et al.,  ). LDA is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant and is based on the concept of searching for a linear combination of features that separate two groups (Mika et al.,  ). LDA explains the group labels by the values of continuous independent variables. By projecting the data into a lower-dimensional space, LDA can avoid the overfitting problem and reduce the overall computational costs. LDA is very similar to principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is used for finding the axes that maximize the variance of data while LDA is used find finding the axes that maximize the separation between multiple groups. LDA also has two major limitations. First, LDA requires the assumption of a common covariance structure in the groups of data, which is very rare in real applications. Second, although LDA can be used for multi-class classification problem, it is more suited to the two-class problem. \n\n\n#### Deep learning classifiers \n  \nDeep learning methods have attracted increasing interesting in various areas and also have been applied in the classification of brain disorders (Plis et al.,  ; Iidaka,  ; Lecun et al.,  ; Calhoun and Sui,  ; Hu et al.,  ; Kim et al.,  ; Han et al.,  ; Jang et al.,  ; Ju et al.,  ). In contrast to traditional machine learning methods, deep learning methods are capable of learning the optimal representation directly from the raw data through using a hierarchical structure with different levels of complexity (Lecun et al.,  ; Schmidhuber,  ; Vieira et al.,  ). Deep learning methods apply non-linear transformations to the raw data, and the transformations provide hidden features with higher levels of abstraction, which will be with more informatics to the original input data space at the lower levels. This advantage not only helps to automatically solve difficulties in the feature selections, especially when the dimension of features is too large or when there is limited prior knowledge about the data, but also can improve classification performance compared with a traditional classifier. \n\nThe artificial neural network (ANN) is popular in the classification of patients using fMRI data (Guo H. et al.,  ; Kim et al.,  ). ANN learns to do tasks from examples by constructing layers with artificial neurons and connections between them. For example, in brain disorder classification, it learns to identify individuals with brain disorder by analyzing training subjects which are labeled as healthy or disorder and using this information to classify other individuals. An auto-encoder is a type of ANN popular used for the brain disorders classifications (Kim et al.,  ; Guo X. et al.,  ; Ju et al.,  ). This method comprises two stages. The first stage is encoding, which maps the input to a hidden representation. The second stage is decoding, which maps hidden representation back to obtain the output that is as close to the input as possible. By imposing sparsity on the hidden layers during training, an auto-encoder can learn useful structures from the input data. This allows sparse representations of inputs, which are useful in pre-training for classification tasks. Deep belief network (DBN) is another class of ANN been used in the classification of brain disorders using fMRI data (Farzi et al.), which is composed of multiple layers of latent variables and the connections between them (Hinton,  ). A DBN is somewhat unique in that it allows undirected connections between some layers, called restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) (Hjelm et al.,  ). DBN usually trains these layers using an unsupervised learning algorithm such as the gradient descent algorithm. Therefore, instead of using deterministic functions and the reconstruction error (like the auto-encoder), DBN is pre-trained using maximum-likelihood estimation (Vieira et al.,  ). \n\nSeveral critical issues challenge the using of deep learning in classification (Schmidhuber,  ; Vieira et al.,  ). The first challenge is the amount of time and computational resources. The number of layers, nodes and the function of each node are usually manually determined, although some automated optimization strategies have been proposed. A large number of parameters needs to be estimated in the deep learning methods, which makes them cost much more computational resources. A second challenge is the potential overfitting problem when using deep learning methods. Since the feature dimension of fMRI data is usually very large while the number of samples is relatively small, deep learning methods will tend to learn features in the data which are specific or limited to the study. Although there are several approaches developed to address this problem, such as regularization strategies and pre-selection of features (i.e., reducing the dimensionality of feature input), these approaches also introduce other critical problems, such as how to induce appropriate sparsity and how to select the best subset of features. The third challenge is the interpretability of results obtained from deep learning methods. The deep learning methods are often treated as a black box, which use consecutive non-linear transformations on the raw features to map them to another space with higher levels of abstraction. Although the model information, such as the node in the hidden layers and the connection between them, has been demonstrated to be useful for distinguishing brain disorders, it is difficult to back-construct them to the original feature space, which will result in problems of interpreting the results. Because of these issues, a deep learning method might work well in the classification of a brain disorder but does not provide any information about the underlying neuroanatomical or neurofunctional alterations. That would be of limited clinical utility (Vieira et al.,  ). Although these issues remain unsolved, deep learning methods are still with a great potential to improve the diagnosis of brain disorders and could be promising tools for advancing the knowledge of disrupted brain cognitive functions in brain disorders. \n\nA summary of the properties of different classifier models can be found in Table  . \n  \nSummary of traditional classifiers and deep learning classifiers. \n  \n\n\n### Binary classification to multi-class classification \n  \nIn the context of the classification of brain disorders, the majority of the conventional studies have just focused on binary classification, in which only the comparison between patients and healthy controls was taken into account. However, from the clinical perspective, it would be more critical to identify and develop biomarkers to differentiate different brain disorders which share similar symptoms. It is also important to separate patients into different sub-groups according to the different stages of brain disorder progression. Therefore, the multi-class classification problem can be a more significant issue for real clinical utility. During the recent decade, increasing brain disorder studies have drawn their attention to multi-class classification. Since most of the traditional classifiers, such as SVM and LDA, were originally designed for binary classification problem (Cortes and Vapnik,  ; Mika et al.,  ), many strategies have been developed to make the traditional classifiers work for multi-class classification problems. The most commonly used strategy is to transform multi-class classification problem to binary classification problem. This strategy includes two different techniques, one-against-one and one-against-whole (Nasrabadi,  ). The former builds binary classifiers for all pairs of groups and uses a voting scheme to make the final decision. The latter one trains a single classifier for each class (against other classes) and generate a real-value confidence score for the final decision. Although this strategy accompanied with traditional classifiers has been widely applied in numerous neuroimaging classification studies, such problem transformation is still controversial. Some other approaches have also been proposed (Hsu and Lin,  ; Fei and Liu,  ), but none of them have been applied to any multi-class brain disorder studies (Kumar and Gopal,  ; Vieira et al.,  ). Compared with the traditional classifiers, deep learning classifiers are more suitable for multi-class comparison because the application of these classifiers on multi-class problems is more straightforward. In the output layer, deep learning classifiers use a softmax activation function, which can be derived by extending simple logistic regression, to represent a categorical distribution instead of group labels. In that case, the probabilities of each input feature belonging to a class are obtained from the output layer, providing a more intuitive index of multi-class membership those sophisticated indices generated from traditional classifiers (Vieira et al.,  ). Nowadays, there is a growing trend toward using deep learning classifiers to separate different brain disorders or brain disorder subtypes, or to diagnose the progression of brain disorder. \n\n\n\n## Applications using brain functional connectivity in the classification of brain disorders \n  \nDuring the period from 1990 to 2017, more than 200 papers used functional connectivity features alone or multi-modality features including functional connectivity to classify or predict brain disorders. In this section, we primarily focus on studies working on classifying patients with a brain disorder from healthy controls (i.e., a binary classification problem), and also include some work distinguishing multiple different disorders (i.e., a multi-class classification problem). We mainly summarize studies relating to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), some of which share very similar symptoms and common changes in the brain that can confound diagnosis, such as SZ vs. BP, ASD vs. ADHD, and AD vs. MCI. Although other brain disorders such as depression also deserve review in the future, our primary goal here is to provide an overview on how far brain functional connectivity features have been used to classify brain disorders and how well the classification frameworks have worked. Figure   and Tables  –  present a summary of the existing application studies that reported their classification accuracy. Regarding the performance, the average classification accuracy is around 80% for those studies, with AD/MCI related studies showing the highest accuracy. In these applications, there are trends from using connectivity features alone (e.g., spatial maps of ICA and functional connectivity) to using complex network properties (e.g., graph-theory based measures); from using static connectivity measures to using dynamic connectivity measures; from using features from single imaging modality to using features from multiple modalities; from using traditional classifiers to using more complex deep learning classifiers; and from classifying patients from healthy controls to classifying multiple groups. In each of the following subsections, we focus on some typical works in more detail to highlight these potential trends. If there are both binary and multi-class classification works, we will describe binary classification studies first. Similarly, we try to first state studies using simple features or classifiers and then that using more complex features or classifiers. \n  \nSummary of the existing application studies (included in Tables  – ).

For each study, we include the brain disorders investigated, the used features, the classifier model, the sample size, and the classification accuracy. It should be noted that evaluating or comparing these studies by only emphasizing the classification accuracy is unfair, since some studies worked on the multi-class classification problem and the sample size and features are greatly varied  . \n    \nSummary of functional connectivity based AD/MCI classification studies. \n    \nSummary of functional connectivity based ASD classification studies. \n    \nSummary of functional connectivity-based ADHD classification studies. \n  \n### Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder \n  \nSchizophrenia is a severe chronic brain disorder whose symptoms can include delusions, disorganized thinking, hallucinations and social withdrawal (Endicott and Spitzer,  ; Kay et al.,  ; Calhoun et al.,  ; Fu et al.,  ). Although schizophrenia only affects about 1% of the population worldwide (Bhugra,  ; Van Os et al.,  ), the symptoms can be very disabling. The symptoms of schizophrenia are categorized into three types: positive, negative and cognitive, and these symptoms usually start in young adulthood and last a long time (American Psychiatric Association,  ). Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder marked by alternating episodes of mania and depression. Bipolar disorder includes four basic subtypes and all of them involve clear changes in mood, energy, and activity levels ( ). The root causes of bipolar disorder are not clearly understood, although it is known that both environmental and genetic factors are involved. There is no standard clinical test for either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Therefore, it is important to investigate the possibility of using neuroimaging data in the automatic diagnosis of these two brain disorders. \n\nMany studies have focused on distinguishing SZ and HC based on the fMRI functional connectivity. ICA based spatial map is one of the most popular used functional features in the classification (Demirci et al.,  ; Arribas et al.,  ; Castro et al.,  ; Du et al.,  ). For example, Du et al. used ICA to extract individual spatial maps as the initial features and then combined a two-level feature identification scheme with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLD) in the classification of SZ (Du et al.,  ). By using a majority vote methods that use multiple features, they achieved a classification accuracy of 98% in the auditory oddball task and 93% in the resting-state. The connectivity between identified networks (i.e., FNC) is another important feature for the classification (Anderson and Cohen,  ; Arbabshirani et al.,  ; Kaufmann et al.,  ). Functional connectivity between ROIs defined by different atlases (i.e., ROI-based) is also commonly used to classify SZs and HCs (Venkataraman et al.,  ; Su et al.,  ; Yu Y. et al.,  , ; Watanabe et al.,  ; Kim et al.,  ). Automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas is the most popular atlas using in the classification, although some other atlases are also used. Besides these straightforward connectivity features (component spatial maps and functional connectivity), high-level network organization has also been considered as important biomarkers. Bassett et al. ( ) used the size of connected components in graphs build from functional connectivity among time-courses for 90 AAL regions as the input features of SVM and achieved up to 75% classification accuracy and 85% sensitivity. Studies also combined functional connectivity with other features from other modalities to distinguish SZ and HC. Yang et al. proposed a hybrid machine learning method to classify SZs and HCs, using features from fMRI and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data (Yang et al.,  ). They combined three models (SNPs, voxels in the fMRI map contributing to classification and network maps from ICA) into a single module using a majority voting approach to make a final decision. Through a leave-one-out cross-validation, they demonstrated that this framework can provide higher classification accuracy (Combined: 87%; SNP: 74%, voxel: 83%, ICA: 83%). In the 24th Machine Learning for Signal Processing competition (MLSP) (Silva et al.,  ), participants were asked to automatically differentiate 69 schizophrenia patients from 75 healthy controls using multimodal features, including FNC features from fMRI data and component loadings using ICA from structural MRI data. Performance was estimated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). No entry was able to attain an overall AUC of 0.9 or higher, and the median AUC is near 0.75 across all 2087 entries. The winning team got an overall AUC of 0.89 by means of a Gaussian process (GP) classifier with prior distribution scaled by a probit transformation. Temporal dynamics in the functional connectivity are widely observed in numerous neuroimaging studies and are suggested to be neural origin. Cetin et al. ( ) used static FNC and dynamic FNC obtained from fMRI and MEG data to differentiate schizophrenia patients from healthy controls. They used a leave-one-out cross validation method to examine the classification accuracy. Their results showed that using the combined fMRI and MEG features from FNC improved the classification performance (in which the highest accuracy is 85.71%) compared to using fMRI and MEG FNC features separately (in which the highest accuracy is 75.82%), and using the combined fMRI and MEG features from dynamic FNC improved more (in which the highest accuracy is 90.11%). Increasing studies have demonstrated the benefits of using deep learning in the classification during recent years. Kim et al. ( ) used a L1-norm regularization for feature selection and a deep neural network (DNN) with multiple hidden layers as the classifier. Their results showed that the DNN can obtain about 86% accuracy of two-group classification which is much better than that obtained by SVM. \n\nFunctional connectivity-based features for classification of SZ and BP patients at the individual level have been studied as well (Calhoun et al.,  ; Arribas et al.,  ; Rashid et al.,  ). In a previous study (Calhoun et al.,  ), the distance to mean image for each group is constructed using ICA spatial maps of the temporal lobe and the default mode networks. This feature was used in a leave-one-out cross-validation framework, and the approach classified schizophrenia and bipolar patients at the individual level with the accuracy of around 83–95%. A supervised method for automatic classification of healthy controls, patients with bipolar disorder, and patients with schizophrenia using brain imaging data was proposed in Arribas et al. ( ). The spatial maps of independent components were used as the features and a dimension reduction stage comprising two steps is performed (1.   t  -test; 2. singular value decomposition). The reduced features were then used as input of a probabilistic Bayesian classifiers classifier. The experimental results showed that the average three-way correct classification rate (CCR) is in the range of 70–72%, demonstrating their proposed method to be a reliable framework on classification analyses of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. More recently, time-varying patterns in the functional connectivity have been used to distinguish SZ from BP patients. Rashid et al. proposed a framework for classification of schizophrenia, bipolar and healthy subjects based on their static and dynamic FNC (Rashid et al.,  ). The classification performance between static and dynamic connectivity features was compared through a cross-validation framework. The overall results showed that dynamic FNC (with the classification accuracy 84.28%) significantly outperforms static FNC (with the classification accuracy 59.12%) in terms of predictive accuracy, suggesting that dynamic patterns in functional connectivity might provide distinct and more information over the SFC. \n\nSZ, SAD, and BPP have overlapping clinical symptoms (Cosgrove and Suppes,  ; Cardno and Owen,  ; Pearlson et al.,  ), hence it is very difficult to distinguish them in clinical diagnosis. Du et al. has identified markers from subject-specific brain networks using resting-state fMRI data via GIG-ICA, and then classified healthy controls, SZ patients, BPP patients, patients suffering from schizoaffective disorder with manic episodes (SADM) disorders, and patients suffering from schizoaffective disorder with depressive episodes exclusively (SADD) (Du et al.,  ). Using the training set, the spatial maps of the typical functional networks were used as the features in a multi-class (five-class) SVM classifier and the RFE was employed for feature selection. For each subject of the testing set, subject-specific networks were computed under the guidance of the group-level networks obtained from the training set, and then the corresponding features were inputted to the classifier trained using the original samples. Results showed that the discriminative regions mainly included frontal, parietal, precuneus, cingulate, supplementary motor, cerebellar, insula and supramarginal cortices, and these regions can provide 68.75% classification accuracy for the new coming subjects (i.e., the independent testing set). Based on measures from functional networks, hierarchical clustering and projection approaches were performed to further investigate the relationship among those groups. Interestingly, the linkage result from the hierarchical clustering showed that using network measures, SADM group and SADD group were closest to each other; SAD group was more similar to SZ group compared to other groups; and BP group was closer to HC group than other patients groups. These results provide an interesting view on the relationship among these symptom-related diseases in addition to accurate separation. The framework and results of this study (Du et al.,  ) are shown in Figures  ,  , respectively. \n  \nFlowchart of one study (Du et al.,  ) that includes classifying HCs, SZ patients, BPP patients, SADM patients, and SADD patients.

This disorder begins early in childhood and lasts throughout one's life. It is estimated that ASD has a prevalence of 1:68 in the United States ( ,  ) and the lifetime costs of treating an American with ASD has exceeded one million dollars (Greenspan,  ). The exact cause of autism is still unknown and it might be caused by genetic, brain structure and function, developmental and environmental factors (Wing,  ). Effective treatments and services can moderate the symptoms and improve the lives. However, ASD is a heterogeneous condition which means there is no same profile for the individuals with ASD and their specific symptoms may change with development (Lord et al.,  ). Consequently, the diagnosis and definition of ASD is still a challenging issue. It is common that children are diagnosed with ASD until ages five and six when is too late for effective treatments. ADHD is another commonly found brain disorder affecting children which share overlapping and confusing symptoms with ASD (Anckarsäter et al.,  ; Happé et al.,  ; Rommelse et al.,  ). Children with ADHD may be inattention, hyperactivity or impulsivity that interferes with school and home life. ADHD is more common in boys than in girls and is usually diagnosed during the early school years and last into adulthood. It is estimated that 3–10% of school-aged children are affected by the ADHD (Biederman,  ; Dey et al.,  ). The cause of ADHD is still unclear and researchers demonstrate that several things, such as heredity, chemical imbalance, brain changes or injury, and poor nutrition might be involved as possible causes. Currently, a diagnosis of ADHD is mainly based on the behavioral symptoms described in DSM (American Psychiatric Association,  ). However, DSM can be misleading since there is no valid test for ADHD and ADHD has a high rate of comorbidity, which can confuse matters. Due to the difficulty in diagnosis of ASD and ADHD, an increasing number of studies are using neuroimaging data to develop approaches to try to better characterize and predict these brain disorders. In the following, we review studies using functional connectivity features in the classification of ASD and ADHD. \n\nStudies using functional connectivity as features to classify ASD began around 2011. Anderson et al. calculated the functional connectivity from 7266 ROI covering gray matter during the resting-state and then used these as the features in a thresholding leave-one-out classifier (Anderson et al.,  ). The classifier performed at 89% accuracy for the subjects < 20 years age and at 79% for all subjects. In another study, Murdaugh et al. used seed-based functional connectivity (seed: medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus) as well as whole-brain functional connectivity in a logistic regression classifier for distinguishing ASD from controls and found that both whole-brain and seed-based connectivity patterns can achieve accuracy up to 96.3% (Murdaugh et al.,  ). The Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) initiative has aggregated functional and structural brain imaging data collected from laboratories around the world to accelerate the understanding of the neural bases of ASD ( )(Di Martino et al.,  ,  ). Plitt et al. used 178 age and IQ matched cohorts from ABIDE and calculated the functional connectivity between three different ROI sets. They used RFE for feature selection in both logistic regression and SVM classifier and obtained an overall 76.7% accuracy of classification (Plitt et al.,  ). Functional connectivity is also combined with the features from other modalities in the classification of ASD. Deshpande et al. identified 18 activated regions from an experiment involving physical and intentional causality and calculated causal connectivity weights, functional connectivity from fMRI, and fractional anisotropy obtained from DTI data for each participant (Deshpande et al.,  ). These features were used in a recursive cluster elimination based SVM classifier and finally achieved a maximum classification accuracy of 95.9%. Deep learning classifiers are applied in the classification of ASD during recent years. Iidaka selected more subjects from ABIDE (312 subjects with ASD and 328 control subjects) and the resting-state functional connectivity between 90 ROIs are used as input of the probabilistic neural network (PNN) for classification. PNN obtained classification results of ~90% accuracy (Iidaka,  ). Chen et al. constructed functional network between signals in different frequency bands using ABIDE dataset and showed that the most of the discriminative features were concentrated on the Slow-4 band (0.027–0.073 Hz) (Chen H. et al.,  ). \n\nThere has also been a fair amount of work using functional connectivity to classify ADHD and healthy controls. Zhu et al. ( ) first used ReHo from fMRI in a PCA-based Fisher discriminative analysis (PC-FDA) to build a linear classifier and the results showed a classification accuracy of 85% using a leave-one-out cross-validation. Wang et al. ( ) extracted ReHo from resting-state fMRI signals and used as input of SVM. They selected features according to a cross-validation procedure and showed that the optimized model produced a total accuracy of 80%. Graph-based measures of functional connectivity are becoming important features that distinguish ADHD from healthy controls (Fair et al.,  ; Dey et al.,  ). Fair et al. used node strength based on the functional connectivity network to successfully classify two subtypes of ADHD (Combined (ADHD-C) and Inattentive (ADHD-I)) from healthy controls with accuracy up to 82.7% (Fair et al.,  ). This graphical measure is also able to separate three groups of cohorts with an overall accuracy of 69.2% in the 3-group classification. Existing studies also use functional connectivity measures along with other fMRI features or other modal features to classify ADHD (Colby et al.,  ; Dai D. et al.,  ; Sato et al.,  ; Anderson A. et al.,  ). For example, Colby et al. combined morphological measures from structural MRI and functional features such as functional connectivity and graphical measures from fMRI as the input features of the SVM and used RFE algorithm for the feature selection. They were able to classify the diagnosis of ADHD with 55% accuracy using this SVM-RFE classifier (Colby et al.,  ). Anderson et al. used functional connectivity measures along with many other features such as curvature index, folding index, Gaussian curvature, gray matter volume, mean curvature, surface area, thickness average, and phenotypic data in a multimodal neuroimaging framework and obtained 66.8% accuracy of two-group classification in an ADHD dataset with a large number of subjects (472 healthy controls and 276 ADHD) (Anderson A. et al.,  ). \n\nStudies have shown that ASD and ADHD have both shared and disorder-specific abnormalities in brain function (Christakou et al.,  ; Chantiluke et al.,  ). However, few studies have used functional connectivity features to distinguish ASD and ADHD and it is still a challenging issue whether functional connectivity can be a powerful biomarker for distinguishing these two brain disorders. \n\n\n### Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment \n  \nMCI is a syndrome which causes greater memory loss than expected by aging (Gauthier et al.,  ). It is reported that about 3–19% of adults older than 65 years suffer MCI. The symptoms of MCI are not as severe as that in AD and thus people with MCI can carry out their normal daily activities (Albert et al.,  ). There are several subtypes of MCI and one subtype called amnestic MCI which is associated with memory loss has a high risk of progression to AD (Gauthier et al.,  ). Research has shown that the brain areas of memory are impaired in both MCI and AD, while the cognitive domains are only impaired in AD (Petersen et al.,  ). Although the rates of progression varied considerably among literature and the progression is not inevitable, amnestic MCI is still considered to be a forerunner of AD. AD is the most common type of dementia causes problems with memory, thinking and behavior (Strittmatter et al.,  ). AD is increasingly prevalent in individuals over the age of 65 and the significance of AD as a public health problem became evident (Glenner,  ). It is estimated that 60 new case of AD exists in every hour and by 2050, this number will go to double (Alzheimer's Association,  ). Between 2000 and 2013, the death results from AD increased remarkably 71%, making AD the sixth leading cause of death in the United States (Alzheimer's Association,  ). \n\nTraditionally, the diagnosis of AD mainly depends on the clinical examinations and the evaluations of individuals' perception and behavior (Arbabshirani et al.,  ). Improving diagnosis of AD and MCI patients might help to identify diseases earlier in the disease's progress, which may be crucial in developing treatments for these disorders. Considering the severe health impact of AD and MCI and their overall effect on caregivers and society, there has been a large numbers of studies using neuroimaging features, especially the functional connectivity in fMRI to diagnose these brain disorders. Wang et al. proposed a discriminative model of AD based on the Pseudo-Fisher Linear Discriminative Analysis (pFLDA) (Wang et al.,  ). They used the correlation/anti-correlation coefficients of two anti-correlated networks in resting brains as the features of the classification model and obtain a CCR of 83%. Challis et al. employed Bayesian Gaussian process logistic regression (GP-LR) models with linear and non-linear covariance functions in the classification of AD and MCI (Challis et al.,  ). By using functional connectivity as features, they achieved 75% accuracy disambiguating healthy controls from individuals with MCI and 97% accuracy disambiguating individuals with MCI and individuals with AD. Not only the functional connectivity itself, but also its extended or related metrics, such as graphic metrics, have been used as features for the diagnosis of AD and MCI. Jie et al. have developed a novel framework to integrate multiple connectivity properties for improving the diagnosis of MCI (Jie et al.,  ). A multi-kernel learning (MKL) technique was adopted and two types of kernels were used to quantify the local and global connectivity properties respectively. 91.9% classification accuracy was achieved by this method, which is much better than that in previous studies using single connectivity properties. Another study combined graphic theoretical approaches with machine learning method to investigate the atypical functional brain network in patients with AD (Khazaee et al.,  ). They performed statistical analysis on connectivity which is measured by correlation coefficient to search altered connectivity patterns in patients and then calculated three graphic metrics, clustering coefficient, local efficiency, and normalized local efficiency based on the connectivity matrix. A SVM classifier was finally used to explore diagnosis ability of these graphic metrics. Their results showed that those graphic metrics can well separate patients with AD and healthy controls with 100% accuracy. Functional connectivity from fMRI is also incorporated with features from other modalities in the diagnosis of AD. Dai et al. proposed a methodological framework using features from multi-modalities to discriminate patients with AD from healthy controls (Dai Z. et al.,  ). The gray matter volume from structural MRI and three functional characteristics from fMRI were used as the features of classifiers. By using leave-one-out cross-validation, this method provided satisfactory classification accuracy of 89.47% with a sensitivity of 87.50% and a specificity of 90.91%. Schouten et al. used measures from structural MRI, diffusion MRI and resting-state fMRI as the input features of elastic net classifier to classify AD (Schouten et al.,  ). They showed the gray matter density achieved the best classification accuracy among all single modal imaging and multimodal combination can significantly improve the classification performance. These findings suggested that different MRI modalities provide complementary information for classifying AD. The human brain is a dynamic system with non-stationary neural activity and rapidly-changing neural interaction. Increasing evidence shows that functional connectivity is not static but varies significantly in time. There already exist studies using dynamic patterns in functional connectivity as features for the classification of dementia and its pre-stages. A MCI study applied a sliding window approach to estimate dynamic functional correlation tensors between white matters and DFC between gray matters and used these as features to classify MCI subjects (Chen X. et al.,  ). They found that the dynamic functional features significantly improved the classification performance, showing that the functional information in gray matter and white matter is complimentary. \n\nAlthough vast majority of AD or MCI classification studies used traditional classifiers such as SVM and LDA, increasing studies have considered the advantages of deep learning classifiers over the traditional ones and started using deep learning models in the classification of AD and MCI (Suk et al.,  ; Meszlényi et al.,  ). Meszlenyi et al. described a convolutional neural network for functional connectivity classification called connectome-convolutional neural network (CCNN) (Meszlényi et al.,  ). By testing the performance of CCNN model on both simulated datasets and a public MCI dataset, they showed that the developed model is capable of distinguishing subjects of different groups. Their results also demonstrated that the CCNN model can combine different functional connectivity metrics in the classification and such combination results in better performance than other classifiers using single metric only. \n\n\n\n## Challenges and difficulties in identifying biomarkers of brain disorders and classification of individual subject \n  \n### Lacking gold standards for diagnoses \n  \nAnalyzing fMRI data for the ultimate goal of identifying biomarkers and diagnosing brain disorders using neuroimage-based measures is promising but challenging, due to the fact that the current diagnostic categorization itself used as prior guidance could be inaccurate and need further refinement (Insel and Cuthbert,  ). So far, there is no gold standard for the complex diagnosis. The diagnosis is determined solely by observable symptoms, and the interview and history are the main factors that influence the diagnosis. For example, in clinical diagnosis, it can be difficult to distinguish SZ, BP, and SAD that show overlapping clinical symptoms (Cosgrove and Suppes,  ; Malaspina et al.,  ; Cardno and Owen,  ). SZ is a psychotic disorder characterized by altered perception, loss of motivation and judgment, and impairment in social cognition. BP is a mood disorder marked by alternating episodes of mania and depression. SAD is diagnosed when the symptom criteria for SZ are met and during the same continuous period there are major depressive, manic or mixed episodes. In fact, there are also overlapping symptoms such as social withdrawal and communication impairment between ASD and SZ spectrum disorders (Fitzgerald,  ; Chisholm et al.,  ). ASD, a neurodevelopmental disorder, is characterized by a spectrum of abnormal behaviors including persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts. ADHD is marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. Research work also shows a high rate of overlapping symptoms between ASD and ADHD (Taurines et al.,  ). Therefore, the similarities in symptoms between these brain disorders give rise to difficulties in clinical diagnosis. \n\nMost existing fMRI studies (Calhoun et al.,  ; Koike et al.,  ; Du et al.,  ), which applied statistical analyses to investigate differences among multiple groups or performed supervised learning approaches to explore biomarkers for effective individual diagnosis and treatment, rely on the diagnostic labeling. The assumptions in those studies are (1) diagnostic groups are distinct from each other and (2) individuals are homogeneous within each predefined group. However, in practice patients could be incorrectly diagnosed due to the overlapping or similar symptoms of diseases, causing that subjects assigned into the same group may show biologically inconsistent alterations. Therefore, the possible bias in the diagnosis labeling will result in inaccurate biomarkers and consequently affect the discriminative power of the classifier constructed based on the provided labels. \n\nThere is a great need for the development of disease categories built on biological data and supported by objective and quantitative validation, i.e., the approach recently emphasized by the RDoC initiative ( ) (Insel et al.,  ; Cuthbert and Insel,  ). Due to imperfections of the current disease nosology (especially for psychiatric disorders), how to identify markers/features from a large amount of possibly relevant measures (e.g., high-dimensional neuroimaging data) and then rebuild or refine the nosology based on the neuroimaging-features is a big challenge. One way forward is to consider identifying markers and rebuilding a nosology of disorders (or classifying individual subjects) as one combined problem. The most important and difficult issue is how to propose a “mathematical, precise resolution of what constitutes ‘sufficiently similar' patients” (Djulbegovic and Paul,  ; Marquand et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Difficulties in identifying accurate pathological features as biomarkers from high dimensional measures \n  \nGiven that there are generally more features than samples, it is advantageous to reduce the number of possible measures to focus on a subset of particular interest. As discussed in section Feature Selection Strategies, most relevant work has extracted features in the context of group labeling (e.g., SZ or HC). Even if feature selection is performed using a supervised method, the resulting features are not necessarily able to show a clustering property within each group as expected, since there are usually abundant unrelated and redundant measures considered. In the event the diagnosis is inaccurate, selection of features so that they can show clustering (or similar) patterns within the same group and distinct patterns between different groups is more difficult. Without using group labeling, Clementz et al. ( ) constructed biotypes using a panel of cognitive and electro physiological features that were selected according to known relevance to psychosis and brain function. Promisingly, biotypes showed more reasonable neurobiological heterogeneity and coherent subgroups in psychosis than diagnosis-based category (Clementz et al.,  ; Meda et al.,  ). However, the selected features depended on subjective empirical knowledge and were not automatically extracted from available data. In contrast, some research work (Gates et al.,  ; Geisler et al.,  ; Sun et al.,  ) used all available features and did not further refine features according to prior knowledge. Such selected features working well for one dataset may not converge to a consistent grouping for a different dataset. More advanced methods which can automatically select features that have a good differentiating ability under the condition of no or less guidance of diagnosis labeling are still under way. Semi-supervised feature selection methods (Sheikhpour et al.,  ), which allow using both labeled and unlabeled samples to discover the feature relevance, may be promising and beneficial. \n\n\n### Challenges in validating biomarkers and classification \n  \nOnce the biomarkers and biologically-derived classification are obtained, validating the biomarkers and categories (or classification) is another important issue. Most related studies have classified independent subjects based on the identified biomarkers and a well-trained model, and then compared the classification outputs with the diagnosis labels. However, researchers should be aware that the diagnosis labels used as ground-truth could be inaccurate. Some work (Geisler et al.,  ; Clementz et al.,  ) evaluated derived categories using external independent measures or other features that were highly correlated with the used features of the same dataset to see if subjects in one group showed greater similarity in terms of those additional metrics. However, this kind of validation is circular to some extent. A more reasonable technique is to assess biomarker and cluster (or classification) reproducibility by adding additional independent subjects' data or re-sampling of the original data, since a rational classification of brain disorders should be able to map onto pathophysiology using different datasets. \n\n\n### Other issues that should be considered \n  \nThere are also other issues which deserve consideration in future clinical applications. In most neuroimaging-based studies focusing on the classification/prediction problem, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to evaluate the distinguishing ability of the biomarkers identified and the model built. Unlike the screening test (Grimes and Schulz,  ) that is to detect potential disorders or diseases in people who do not have any symptoms of disease, these assessing metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) cannot provide a realistic measure of the positive (probability of having the disease given a positive test) and negative (probability of not having the disorder given a negative test) predictive value (Castellanos et al.,  ), since prevalence of different diseases influences positive/negative predictive value. \n\nIn addition to accurately classify the categorization of brain disorders, increasing studies focus on prediction of continuous variables such as individual cognitive scores, symptomatic scores and behavioral performance using fMRI data (Meskaldji et al.,  ; Meng et al.,  ; Shen et al.,  ; Yoo et al.,  ). These studies used different brain connectivity features as the inputs and generate predictors of these features for new coming subjects. Linear regression and partial least square (PLS) regression are the most commonly used methods to achieve the goal. PLS, in which the predictor variables are projected to a new space of components with regard to response variables, is particularly useful, since the number of features is usually much larger than the number of observations/subjects. Support vector regression (Dosenbach et al.,  ), a supervised learning algorithm, which considers all features simultaneously and generates a model that assigns different weights to different features, can also be employed. Generally, the correlation between predicted variables and real recorded variables in the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the model. \n\nIt should be noted that brain diseases can also induce spatial changes due to atrophy for example. In the preprocessing step, inter-subject spatial alignment of fMRI data is typically achieved through registering their co-registered structural MRI images to an anatomic template or directly registering fMRI data to an echo planar imaging (EPI) template. However, these registration methods cannot guarantee fully accurate inter-subject functional consistency, although the following spatial smoothing of fMRI data can reduce the inter-subject functional variability to some extent. Therefore, functional connectivity computed between given brain regions may not accurately correspond across subjects, although the adaptive ICA-based methods are likely more robust to this than ROI or voxel based approaches. In the future, advanced normalization methods (Khullar et al.,  ; Jiang et al.,  ; Cetin et al.,  ) based on function information directly from fMRI data can help address this issue. \n\n\n\n## Summary \n  \nMapping brain functional connectivity using fMRI data is now a major emphasis of ongoing research, frequently with a goal of identifying biomarkers and classifying different brain disorders. In this paper, we comprehensively reviewed different approaches which make efforts to accurately map the functional connectome. We included both the traditional static connectivity analysis and the more recently applied dynamic connectivity analysis. Connectivity measures that can be potentially taken as features (i.e., biomarkers) for classification and prediction were clearly summarized for each method. Furthermore, we surveyed various feature selection and classifier building strategies in order to provide guidance on how to perform the classification and predication problem in practice. After that, an updated overview on applications of classifying SZ, BP, ASD, ADHD, were shown. Finally, we discussed gaps in the research and areas that particularly deserve improvement. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nYD proposed the framework and wrote the paper.

Accordingly, time-varying correlations (Functional Connectivity) in resting fMRI have been shown to be predictive of behavioural traits, and psychiatric and neurological conditions. Typically, methods that measure time varying Functional Connectivity (FC), such as sliding windows approaches, do not separately model when changes occur in the mean activity levels from when changes occur in the FC, therefore conflating these two distinct types of modulation. We show that this can bias the estimation of time-varying FC to appear more stable over time than it actually is. Here, we propose an alternative approach that models changes in the mean brain activity and in the FC as being able to occur at different times to each other. We refer to this method as the Multi-dynamic Adversarial Generator Encoder (MAGE) model, which includes a model of the network dynamics that captures long-range time dependencies, and is estimated on fMRI data using principles of Generative Adversarial Networks. We evaluated the approach across several simulation studies and resting fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (1003 subjects), as well as from UK Biobank (13301 subjects). Importantly, we find that separating fluctuations in the mean activity levels from those in the FC reveals much stronger changes in FC over time, and is a better predictor of individual behavioural variability. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nLarge-scale networks of brain activity can be detected as fluctuations of blood oxygenation levels in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) ( ,  ). These functional networks can be detected in the presence of an experimental paradigm and in spontaneous resting-state activity ( ,  ,  ). Many studies estimate FC by calculating the average correlation across an entire fMRI scanning session data ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ), and these time-averaged measures of FC have been widely associated with cognitive phenotypes and neuropsychiatric disorders in the literature ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nThere is now increasing interest in studying the time-varying nature of FC in fMRI. Significant within-session fluctuations in FC during rest or task fMRI have been demonstrated in a number of studies ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and are also well-established in electrophysiological data ( ,  ,  ,  ). Further, a number of research studies have shown the utility of time-varying FC (TVFC) in identifying many psychiatric and neurological conditions e.g., multiple sclerosis ( ,  ,  ), schizophrenia ( ), Parkinson’s ( ), stroke ( ), autism spectrum disorder ( ), epilepsy ( ) and major depressive disorder ( ); and the dynamics of TVFC have been shown to coactivate with spontaneous replay of recently acquired information ( ). Moreover, inter-subject differences in TVFC have also been associated with a number of behavioural and cognitive traits ( ,  ), with some aspects of intelligence only being explained by TVFC ( ). \n\nDespite these successes in the estimation and use of TVFC, it is striking how homogeneous FC actually appears to be in fMRI data over time. Indeed, there are a number of studies reporting that there is even insufficient evidence of within-session fluctuations in FC in resting fMRI data ( ,  ,  ). While it is possible that close to homogeneous FC in fMRI is a genuine phenomenon, it is also possible that it is instead caused by limitations in the methods used to compute TVFC. \n\nMost previous work is based on the sliding window correlation (SWC) approach ( ). There are many variants of the SWC method ( ,  ,  ,  ), which are typically limited by using sliding windows of a specified, fixed width. This means that they fail to adapt to the intrinsic time-point by time-point variability of the FC, resulting in changes in FC getting smeared together, thereby making FC look more homogeneous over time. Some of these limitations can be overcome by methods that adapt automatically to time periods of distinct network activity, such as those based on Hidden Markov modelling (HMM) ( ,  ). Even then, a surprising amount of apparent homogeneity in the FC over time persists. \n\nSWC and the HMM have in common that the mean activity and FC estimations are coupled; that is, changes in the mean activity level are by definition accompanied by changes in the FC, when both are modelled. For example, the most common version of the HMM for fMRI characterises each state as a Gaussian distribution with both mean and covariance. Since there is no biological reason for this coupling assumption, in this work we consider the consequences of relaxing that constraint, in fact showing that this change can offer a potential explanation for the homogeneity of TVFC seen in approaches that tie the dynamics of the mean and the FC together. \n\nOur proposed method for uncoupling the dynamics of the mean activity and FC is called the Multi-dynamic Adversarial Generator-Encoder (MAGE). This proposes a multi-dynamic modelling approach that allows the mean activity and FC to fluctuate in time independently from each other. At the same time, MAGE captures long range temporal dynamics of FC and mean activity using recurrent neural networks (in contrast to the Markovian assumption of the HMM) ( ,  ). Finally, our proposed model allows multiple brain states to be simultaneously active (in contrast to the categorical “mutual exclusivity” assumption of the standard HMM). To estimate this model on fMRI data, we developed a novel adversarial generator-encoder network framework inspired by the adversarial regularization used in generative adversarial networks (GANs) ( ,  ,  ). \n\nIn this paper, we demonstrate the validity of MAGE on several simulation studies and a cognitive task dataset. We also apply the method to resting-state fMRI studies and deduce several outcomes regarding TVFC temporal dynamics, revealing more distinct patterns of FC over time than are obtained with SWC and the HMM, providing an explanation as to why resting fMRI FC has appeared so temporally stable in previous work ( ,  ,  ). Finally, we substantiate our findings by demonstrating improved prediction of behavioural and cognitive traits using MAGE-derived TVFC estimates. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n###  multi-dynamic   model \n  \nOur proposed approach assumes that fMRI data is generated by a multivariate Normal distribution process with a time-varying mean,  , and covariance,  :  where   is the value of standardised fMRI data, Y (N x T) at time point t, and N is the number of channels (e.g., brain regions). \n\nIn order to separately model the time-varying variances and the correlations, we partition the covariance into a NxN diagonal matrix of standard deviations for each brain region,  , and an NxN correlation matrix,  :  where the correlation matrix,  , captures instantaneous correlation between brain regions; which we refer to as instantaneous FC. \n\nClearly, it will not be possible to estimate the instantaneous correlation and means (and variances) at every timepoint without further constraints. As such, we model regularised versions of them by capturing their repeating spatio-temporal structure using an adaptive temporal prior. \n\nSpecifically, we assume that the means and correlations (and variances) are generated from their own linear mixture of a limited, underlying set of dynamic modes or states:  where   is a scalar corresponding to the time course of the  th “mean activity” state (p=1... P), and   is its Nx1 spatial map of mean activity; and   is a scalar corresponding to the time course of the  th “correlation” state (q=1... Q), and   is its NxN correlation matrix; and   is a scalar corresponding to the time course of the  th “variance” state (r=1... R), and   is its Nx1 spatial map of the standard deviations. The   correlation matrices capture the state-specific correlation between brain regions; which we refer to as the state-specific FC. As we shall describe in detail later, we assume that both the state time courses [ ,   and  ] and the state-specific maps [ ,  ,  ] are unknown and need inferring from the data. Also,  ,   and   are not coupled together and are completely free to fluctuate independently. \n\nNote that in  ,  ,   the correlations and means (and variances) are regularised using their own distinct priors, or dynamics. This is in contrast to most TVFC methods, which are   single-dynamic   approaches in that the dynamics of the means and the correlations (i.e., the FC) are tied together. However, there is no imperative to assume that the dynamics of the means and correlations are the same as each other. As such, the proposed method is designed to explore what happens when we do not tie all of the dynamics together. We refer to this approach as   multi-dynamic  , as illustrated in  [A].   \nSingle-dynamic versus multi-dynamic brain networks.   [A]   Top plot shows example brain network dynamics for the two scenarios; line width indicates functional connectivity (FC) strength, and size of node indicates mean activity amplitude. Middle and bottom plots highlight how the single-dynamic case assumes that the means and the FC change together, whereas in the multi-dynamic case they can change at distinct times.   [B]   Simple simulation illustrating the potential benefits of a multi-dynamic approach. The ground truth is that there are different dynamics underlying the time-varying means and FC. The multi-dynamic approach is able to accurately adjust to fluctuating FC (illustrated for four edges of the FC matrix), whereas the single-dynamic approach is not able to accurately capture these fluctuations, producing time-varying, instantaneous FC that erroneously looks much more homogeneous, as is often observed in time-varying FC estimates in real fMRI data. Lastly, the multi-dynamic approach is also able to adjust to fluctuating mean as shown in Figure S6. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n#### Special case - Sliding window correlation \n  \nSliding window correlation (SWC) measures of TVFC capture how the between-brain-region correlation fluctuates over time. For simplicity here (but without loss of generality), we assume non-overlapping sliding windows. This corresponds to  ,  ,  , where  ,   and   are set to be the same, and are fixed a priori to correspond to the P=Q=R different positions the sliding window can take as it slides through time (e.g., in the case of square windows,   and   and   have a value of one inside the sliding window, and a value of zero outside of it). Note that P=Q=R needs to typically be very large to span all the data over time; and so SWC approaches are normally followed by a clustering approach, such as k-means, to find repeating correlation patterns ( ,  ). Typically, information about how the mean fluctuates over time is ignored. Since  ,   and   are set to be the same, i.e., the means and correlations (and variances) are modelled using the same dynamics, then SWC corresponds to what we refer to as a   single-dynamics   approach (see  [A]). \n\n\n#### Special case - hidden Markov models \n  \nHidden Markov Models (HMM), with multi-variate Normal observation models, capture how both the mean activity levels and the between-brain-region correlations fluctuate over time. This form of the HMM is the same as SWC in that it corresponds to  ,  ,   where the time courses  ,   and   are the same however,  ,   and   are now inferred from the data at the same time as  ,   and  . This means that the approach can adjust to how the transient network states are coming and going for different durations at different points in time. Note that in addition, the HMM assumes that   =   =   are binary time courses, defining when states p switches on and off, and that no two states can be active at the same time (i.e., the states are mutually exclusive). As with SWC, since the means and correlations (and variances) are modelled using the same dynamics, then this version of the HMM corresponds to what we refer to as a   single-dynamics   approach (see  [A]). \n\n\n\n### What do we mean by functional connectivity? \n  \nTypically, correlation-based functional connectivity in fMRI refers to the correlation between two fMRI time series. However, in the model we are proposing, there are multiple entities that could be described as FC, all of which capture some different aspect of correlation between brain regions. First, the model describes the correlation at each time point, i.e.,   (Eqs.  ,  ). We refer to these as the   instantaneous FCs  . Second, a set of state-specific correlations, i.e.,  , are mixed together to regularise the instantaneous FC (see  ). We will refer to these as   state-specific FCs  . Finally, we might also consider correlations in the mean activity time courses, which is a single correlation matrix that corresponds to the correlation of   over all time, i.e., Corr( ). We will refer to this as the   mean activity FC  ; this is potentially quite independent of the state-specific FCs. \n\nOur model provides a regularised estimate of the instantaneous FC, and so we can more parsimoniously represent the instantaneous FC using the state-specific FCs. Hence in this work, we focus on using the state-specific FCs as our main TVFC feature of interest, for example when predicting behavioural traits. \n\n\n### Multi-dynamic adversarial generator-encoder (MAGE) \n  \nEquations  –  describe the modelling framework for the multi-dynamic approach we are proposing. In this section, we will describe the more complete generative model, including the generative process assumed for the dynamics of  ,   and  , and how we infer on the model. We refer to the overall approach as the   Multi-dynamic Adversarial Generator-Encoder   (MAGE). \n\nIn practice, MAGE assumes that the dynamics of the means and variances are tied together, but crucially the correlation is assumed to fluctuate independently. This corresponds to  ,  ,   with   =   (P=R), but with   free to be inferred separately.  Alongside the state time courses we also infer the state-specific features:  ,   and  . Note that while the dynamics of both the means and the variances are always modelled (and are tied together with the same dynamics), for simplicity we will tend to refer to just the dynamics of the means throughout the paper. \n\nIn addition, unlike the HMM, MAGE does not assume that state time courses are binary and mutually exclusive. Instead, we assume that they describe time-varying linear mixtures with a sum-to-one constraint ( ,   and   separately sums to one at each time point), which we will refer to as “partial volume” state time-courses. This sum-to-one constraint is an identification condition that is imposed to ensure identifiability ( ) on the inferred states and makes the post-model temporal analysis interpretable. \n\nIn summary, MAGE describes the data as being generated from a finite set of states. These states are linearly mixed together at each time-point to generate a time-varying description of the data’s mean and covariance. \n\n#### Generative model \n  \nThe generative model for the data,  , corresponds to  . Each instance of   is described by a multivariate Normal distribution parameterised by the mean activity at time t,  , ( ) and the covariance matrix at time t,   ( ). We model the state time courses,  ,   and  , based on their underlying logits:  where   is the softmax function, ensuring that   and   sum to one (over states) at each time point. \n\nThe dynamics in   and   (and implicitly the dynamics of the state time courses) are captured using a unidirectional sequence-to-sequence long short-term memory (LSTM) model, which uses the history of  , to predict the value at the next time point. Specifically, it predicts the prior means of the latent, time-varying parameters [ ,  ].  where   and   are the prior means of   and   respectively.   is the affine transformation and   and   represents the weights of the affine transformation.   and   are the generative model LSTM weights. The proposed generative model for the data is illustrated in   (and the in-depth architecture is illustrated in Figure S2).   \nGenerative model for MAGE. The proposed model generates data by first generating instantaneous means and the instantaneous correlation matrices (i.e., functional connectivity). MAGE also models instantaneous variances, whose dynamics are tied to be the same as the mean (not shown here). The instantaneous mean is modelled using an underlying set of states, for which the state time courses are generated using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The instantaneous correlation is also modelled using an underlying set of states, whose state time courses are generated using a completely different LSTM, making the approach multi-dynamic. The generative model for SAGE is illustrated in Figure S1. \n  Fig. 2   \n\n\n#### Inference \n  \nGiven fMRI data, we need to infer on the parameters [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ] in the generative model. We infer point estimates with uniform priors for the global parameters in the model, i.e., [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]; but for the more challenging inference of the latent, time-varying parameters [ ,  ], we want to regularise using priors (which here corresponds to the prior means of [ ,  ] as stated in Eqs.  ,  ). This could be attempted using a number of different approaches. For example, Variational Bayes (VB) methods could be used based on the ideas from Variational autoencoders (VAEs) ( ), where the generative model acts as a decoder that maps from the latent, time-varying parameters [ ,  ] to the fMRI data. The loss function in VB inference is based on optimizing the variational free energy ( ) and consists of two terms - the reconstruction likelihood, and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence that regularises the solution by matching the learned posterior distribution to a prior distribution over the latent variables (i.e., Eqs.  ,  ). \n\nHere, we take an approach based on an adversarial autoencoder (AAE) ( ). Again, the generative model acts as a decoder that maps from the parameters underlying the state time courses, [ ,  ], to the fMRI data, and hence the reconstruction likelihood term of the AAE is the same as it would be in a VAE. However, the AAE replaces the regularising KL divergence term of the VAE with an adversarial training criterion ( ,  ). This takes the idea of adversarial loss from GANs to achieve the prior regularization - by forcing the posterior means underlying the state time courses, [ ,  ], to be close to the specified prior means (i.e., Eqs.  ,  ). To do this, we train a discriminator, separately from the training that corresponds to the generative model parameter inference, to be able to distinguish between the prior and posterior versions of the [ ,  ]. The trained discriminator is then used to enforce closeness between the posterior and prior (alongside the reconstruction likelihood) when performing the model parameter inference. \n\n Encoder Model   The encoder model maps from the fMRI data to the posterior estimates of the latent, time-varying parameters [ ,  ]. This can also be referred to as the inference network or inference model and corresponds to the idea of amortized inference in VAEs, whereby the encoder allows an efficient means to “look-up” the posterior estimates given the data ( ). The authors who proposed AAEs ( ) explored the benefits of being fully Bayesian on the latent variables, by assuming that the posterior is a Gaussian distribution (with the mean and variance predicted by the encoder, in a similar manner to the VAE); but after an extensive hyper-parameter search, they did not find any additional advantages, and only reported results using a deterministic version of the posterior. As such, we learned a single nonlinear mapping that is used to map from the data,  , to the posterior means at any time point:  where   and   are the posterior means of   and   respectively.   is a sequence-to-sequence, bidirectional LSTM model, and   and   are the encoder LSTM weights.   is the affine transformation and   and   represents the weights of the affine transformation. Note that the approach is still stochastic since we use batching of the data. \n\n Discriminator Model   As mentioned above, a discriminator is needed to be able to distinguish between the prior and posterior mean estimates of the state time courses, [ ,  ]. The discriminator is also constructed using a sequence-to-sequence, bidirectional LSTM model and it classifies whether samples are from the posterior or prior estimates of [ ,  ]:  where   is the sigmoid activation to ensure that discriminator output is either 0 or 1, and   and   are the discriminator LSTM weights.   is the affine transformation and   and   represents the weights of the affine transformation. Note that the discriminator takes in as input the full history of both the prior and posterior mean state time courses into its LSTM. Taken together with the fact that we do not factorise the posteriors of [ ,  ] over time, this means that the trained discriminator will help drive the prior and posterior state time courses to have similar characteristics not just over short, but also over long, time scales. \n\n\n#### How it works \n  \nWe trained this model as a three-player game played between the generator (i.e., the generative model with parameters [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]), encoder (with parameters [ ,  ,  ,  ]), and discriminator (with parameters [ ,  ,  ,  ]). The discriminator model is trained to distinguish prior mean estimates of [ ,  ] from their posterior mean estimates. The discriminator is then used to enforce closeness between the posterior and prior of those parameters (while also honouring the reconstruction likelihood) when training the encoder and generator. In this game, when the discriminator successfully identifies the prior from posterior, it is rewarded; whereas both encoder and generator models are penalized. In contrast, when the combined efforts of the encoder and generator models fools the discriminator, the discriminator is penalized. Note, that at the same time the encoder and generator models must also look to maximise the reconstruction likelihood. \n\nThis three-player game is played with two main loss functions that are listed below:   \n Reconstruction (Likelihood) loss:   The first loss corresponds to the likelihood - this tells us how well we are explaining our data according to the current estimate of the generative model, and is given by: \n  \n Regularization (Prior) Loss:   The second loss regularises the estimate of the latent, time-varying parameters [ ,  ] using an adaptive prior - this penalises when the posterior estimates of [ ,  ] deviate from the prior: \n\nThis corresponds to the cross-entropy between the prior and the posterior of the latent, time-varying parameters [ ,  ]. \n  \n\nThe total loss is the summation of these two terms:  where we attribute a certain weight to each term using  . The expression in   can be thought of as an approximation of the variational free energy, but where the KL term is replaced by regularisation loss in  . The complete derivation for the regularisation loss in   is given in Section S1.5. We trained the parameters (i.e.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) using these losses in two phases - the reconstruction phase and the regularization phase - which are explained below:   \n Reconstruction Phase:   In the reconstruction phase ( ), the generator model (with parameters [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]) and encoder model (with parameters [ ,  ,  ,  ]) are updated to minimize the reconstruction loss. We kept the discriminator model (with parameters [ ,  ,  ,  ]) constant during this phase, otherwise the generator and encoder would be trying to hit a moving target and might never converge. \n  \n Regularization Phase:   In the regularization phase ( ), the discriminator model (with parameters [ ,  ,  ,  ]) is first updated to distinguish prior and posterior mean estimates of [ ,  ]. Then, the parameters of the generator model and encoder model are updated to confuse the discriminator model. \n  \n\n\n#### Single-dynamic adversarial generator-Encoder (SAGE) \n  \nThere is variant of the proposed model, SAGE, that assumes the time courses  ,   and   are the same. In this regard it is the same as the HMM. However, SAGE maintains the long-range temporal modelling and the partial volume modelling of the network state dynamics that are not part of the standard HMM. Throughout this paper, we will compare MAGE with SAGE to highlight the benefits of the multi-dynamic modelling. SAGE is explained in Section S1.1 and is illustrated in Figure S1. \n\n\n\n### Dual-Estimation of the group-level MAGE \n  \nWe performed a process of dual-estimation (analogous to dual-regression following group-ICA) ( ) to infer the subject-level state versions of the group-level MAGE. This allows us to obtain a subject-specific description of time-varying coorelation and time-varying mean. To achieve this, we used the trained parameters inferred from the group-level MAGE ( ,  ,  ,   and  ). Then we re-estimated the   and   for each subject by holding constant the   and   parameters, and only retraining  ,   and  . \n\n\n### Hyper-parameters tuning and cross-validation \n  \nThe hyper-parameters for MAGE were chosen using extensive trial and error by monitoring the validation loss. Some of the hyper-parameters are detailed as follows: 1) The sequence/window length, W, (number of data time-points) was set to 100 and batch-size, B, (number of grouped sequences) was set to 32 - this implies that each batch has a dimension of B*W*N. 2) a small learning rate of 0.0001 was used with large momentum value of 0.9. 3) Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation (NAdam) optimizer was applied for training the data. 4) the number of units (the dimension of the inner cells in LSTM) for each LSTM layer was set between 8 to 64 (depending on the number of subjects). 5)   was optimised depending on the data-set (mostly constrained between 0.85 to 0.95  ). MAGE is an unsupervised algorithm, still, we were rigorous with the performance validation - we trained MAGE using the training/validation split with 80% data in the training subset and 20% data in the validation subset during any experiment. \n\nTo ensure that the reported MAGE results are reproducible, we performed cross-validations on different non-overlapping sets of subjects. We calculated the similarity of the MAGE estimated state-specific FC correlation and mean activity estimates across these different runs to highlight that the MAGE estimated states are replicable. For statistical testing conducted in this paper, we have performed paired   t  -test to determine whether there is statistical evidence that the mean difference between paired observations on a particular outcome is significantly different from zero. We have used symbols to report the test results; * when  , ** when   and *** when  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### MAGE can infer dynamic linear mixtures of FC states \n  \nWe start by considering the performance of our proposed method, MAGE, when we set aside the proposed multi-dynamic modelling. This version of MAGE models single-dynamics (where the state time courses for the mean activity and the correlations are the same, i.e.,   =  ) and is referred to as SAGE. SAGE otherwise maintains all of the other features of MAGE, including the long-range temporal modelling and the partial volume modelling of the state dynamics. \n\nWe first demonstrate SAGE’s ability to infer state time courses that are dynamic linear mixtures (i.e., partial volume mixtures) with more than one underlying state active at each time point, t. Note that this is in contrast to categorical simulations (i.e., HMM assumptions), where the ground-truth state time-courses,   are either 1 or 0 (see Figure S3 for simulations demonstrating M/SAGE’s performance on categorical data). In the partial volume simulations, the ground-truth state time-courses,   could be any continuous number from 0 to 1 for any state, but where the sum of   for all states,   at any time-point, t, should be 1. \n\n [A], shows illustrative examples where the number of simulated states is two and three respectively. Either one, two, or three can be active at any time point. The simulated ground-truth in  [A] is   single-dynamic   and the simulated state time courses (demonstrated in  [A]) are common to both the time-varying mean and correlations. We compared SAGE with the HMM to see how they recover the underlying simulated state time courses and the observation model parameters. The HMM failed to infer these state time courses accurately, as HMM is built around the assumption that only one state is active at any time point. On the other hand, SAGE does a good job of inferring these partial volume state time courses. To quantitatively assess the performance of these models, we calculated the Riemannian distance between the simulated covariances and the inferred covariances for each time point. The lower the Riemannian distance between the inferred and simulated covariance, the better the performance of the model. We can see that SAGE can accurately infer the underlying time-varying covariance, but this is not the case for the HMM.   \nComparison of the performance of the single-dynamic approach SAGE versus HMM, using simulations of dynamic linear mixtures of FC states (i.e., partial volume) and single-dynamics dynamics (i.e., where the state dynamics of the means and correlations are tied together).   [A]   Two illustrative partial volume examples, comparing SAGE performance with HMM. In scenario x, two states can be simultaneously active, whereas, in scenario y, up to three states can be simultaneously active. Note that these state-time courses were common to both the time-varying mean and correlations (i.e., instantaneous FC). The bottom row of   [A]   shows the Riemannian distance between the inferred and simulated covariances for both HMM and SAGE.   [B-C]   Comparison of the performance of SAGE with HMM on a number of partial volume simulations. Each box plot shows the distribution of prediction performance results over 50 different simulations. Riemannian distance between inferred and simulated covariances was used as a measure of success in   [B]  , and prediction correlation between the inferred and simulated state time-courses in   [C]  . \n  Fig. 3   \n\n [B,C] shows the performance of the approaches across many partial volume scenarios. We varied the number of overlapping states (either 2, 3, or 4), and then compared the performance of SAGE against the HMM. For each overlapping state configuration, we generated 50 different simulations in which we varied the state time courses (% of overlap), and the observation model itself. We illustrated the Riemannian distance between the inferred and simulated covariances. We also showed the prediction correlation (not accuracy, as state time courses, are no longer categorical) between the inferred and the simulated state time courses. \n\nLastly, we demonstrate the performance of MAGE for scenarios where the ground-truth is such that FC is static (i.e., no fluctuations in edges of the FC matrix over time). We show that MAGE does not infer time-varying correlations when we infer more than one state for such simulations (see Figure S4). This highlights that MAGE only infers time-varying FC when the underlying FC is time-varying. \n\n\n### Failing to model distinct mean activity dynamics can result in homogeneous estimation of FC over time \n  \nCommonly-used SWC and HMM approaches are what we refer to as single-dynamic models, as they tend to tie the dynamics of the correlations (i.e., the FC) to be the same as the dynamics of the means of the brain activity. However, if the underlying truth is that the dynamics of the means and correlations are actually distinct from each other, then using single-dynamic approaches to infer TVFC can have negative consequences. This is because forcing   to be the same as  , when the ground truth is that they are not the same, causes the dynamics used for estimating the state-specific FC to be incorrect. This then leads to a smearing of the FC estimation over time, making it look more homogeneous than it really is. \n\nWe illustrate the mechanism of the multi-dynamic approach using a simple scenario in  [A]. Furthermore, in  [B], we demonstrate the potential benefits of the multi-dynamic approach on a simulation  in which the ground truth is such that the correlation dynamics and the mean activity dynamics are not tied together. Specifically,  [B] shows the instantaneous FC estimated using SAGE or MAGE when we simulate using  –  with   not equal to  . \n\nWhen we infer TVFC using SAGE, the single-dynamic version of MAGE (with   set to be the same as  ), there are substantially reduced fluctuations in the inferred instantaneous FC over time (i.e., FC is mapped as being near-homogeneous/static) as is often observed in TVFC estimates in real fMRI data. In contrast, the multi-dynamic version of MAGE (with   free to be not equal to  ) is better able to capture the true fluctuations in instantaneous FC over time. \n\n\n### MAGE can infer dynamics in the FC that are distinct from dynamics in the means of brain activity \n  \nWe next sought to see if MAGE could identify multi-dynamics in a range of scenarios. For this, we simulated distinct dynamics (i.e., multi-dynamics) for the mean and correlations (i.e., the FC) by simulating two different state time courses,   and  , using two different hidden semi-Markov model chains, whose state lifetime values were sampled from two different gamma distributions such that   was not equal to  . These state time courses were then used in  –  to simulate the data. \n\nWe compared the performance of the multi-dynamic approach (MAGE) with the single-dynamic approach (SAGE) in  [A,B]. As illustrated in  [A], the lifetimes of both the mean and correlation states in the simulation were sampled from the gamma distribution. However, we fixed the distribution of lifetimes of the correlation state time courses by setting the gamma distribution parameter to k=30, whereas, for the mean state time courses, we varied k from 5 to 80, so that the mean state time courses spanned a variety of timescales in different scenarios. In  [B], it is the other way around, where we fixed the lifetime distribution of the mean state time courses (k =30), but varied the lifetime distribution for the correlation state time-courses (again from k = 5 to 80). In  [A,B], we have plotted the prediction accuracy for the state time courses of correlation and mean. MAGE does a better job in predicting the underlying simulated labels for state time-courses as compared to SAGE. Note that we did not draw any comparison with the HMM here, as the HMM is also a single-dynamic approach, and the HMM is not able to infer the mean and correlation in such a multi-dynamic fashion (and hence the results would be expected to be closest to SAGE).   \nComparison of the performance of the multi-dynamic approach (MAGE) and the single-dynamics approach (SAGE) on multi-dynamic simulations where multi-dynamics are the ground truth (i.e., where the state dynamics of the means and correlations are free to fluctuate independently).   [A,B]   The prediction performance of multi-dynamic and single-dynamic approaches are compared across a range of simulations. The x-axis shows the lifetime parameter (sampled from a gamma distribution) for the mean and correlation state time-courses, whereas the y-axis shows the prediction accuracy of the inferred state time-courses. Specifically, in   [A]  , we fixed the lifetime distribution of the correlation state time-courses (k = 30, as shown by the shaded bar) but varied the lifetime distribution for the mean state time-courses (from k = 5 to 80), and it is the other way around in   [B]  . \n  Fig. 4   \n\n\n### MAGE learns network state dynamics that show appropriate task dependencies \n  \nIn order to help validate the different dynamics that MAGE is inferring, we applied it to task fMRI data. The idea is to train MAGE with no knowledge of the task timings (i.e., unsupervised), allowing us to see if the state dynamics being inferred by MAGE are meaningful in the sense that they exhibit dynamics that link to the task. Furthermore, we wanted to compare how the FC varies across the task conditions using the MAGE approach (and judge whether the inferred spatial maps are meaningful). \n\nTask fMRI data used was collected as part of a previous study from 15 healthy volunteers (7 females, 8 males, age = 27.3 4.4yr, all right-handed) without any previous neurological disorders ( ,  ). Participants performed four different tasks: rest, motor only, visual only, and simultaneous (but independent) visual and motor tasks, and each task was repeated four different times. The motor task involved continuous finger-tapping against the thumb using the right hand. The vision task consisted of videos of colourful abstract shapes in motion. During the combined motor-visual task, participants performed the finger-tapping task while simultaneously watching the videos. We applied a framework used for identifying large-scale probabilistic functional modes (PROFUMO) ( ,  ), to identify parcels that are allowed to be correlated with each other in space and/or time, and which explicitly models between-subject variability in the parcels. We applied PROFUMO on this data with a dimensionality of 30, which outputs 30 parcel time-courses. These then correspond to the N=30 channels of data that are fed into MAGE. \n\n Temporal Dynamics   In the main results shown in  , we modelled four states using MAGE, so that the number of states is matched to the number of task conditions. In  [A], we have plotted the task-evoked occupancy, which is the average of the MAGE inferred state time courses across the four repeated runs (as each experimental condition is repeated four times). The task-evoked occupancy shows clearly that the inferred states switch at the same time as the experimental task condition changes. It is worth noting from  [A] that the estimated FC-driven state-time courses,  , performed better than the mean activity/variance-driven time-courses,  . Moreover, in Figure S7, we have illustrated the results of task decoding when we modelled more than 4 states. In Figure S7[A], we have modelled 8 states and in Figure S7[B], we have modelled 16 states, and we plotted the relative fractional occupancy (time spent in each state) distribution for each of the modelled states. It is evident that even with the increased number of states, we can still see dynamics that are task dependent and can identify task-specific states (as highlighted by the paired   t  -test values on the respective states).   \n [task fMRI data]   Validation of the performance of MAGE on a on a real task fMRI data-set.   [A]   There are four different tasks performed by the participants (rest, visual, motor, and visual-motor). Task-evoked occupancy plots of the state time courses from MAGE (learnt with no knowledge of the task timings) across the four tasks, where the x-axis represents the number of time points and the y-axis corresponds to the average activation value for that state. Specifically, the task-evoked plot curves show the mean and standard deviation across four repeated runs of each experimental condition for all 15 subjects.   [B]   The state-specific spatial maps for the functional connectivity (FC) and mean activity, which are labelled according to the task conditions that their state time courses most correspond to. The state-specific spatial maps for variance are not illustrated as there is no between-state variability in the inferred variance states. For the mean activity maps, the average amplitude of each node/channel is shown. The negative mean activity (e.g., deactivation of the visual network during the motor task) refers to decreases in signal change compared to the baseline. For the FC maps, rank-one decompositions (first Eigenvector) of the estimated state-specific FC correlation matrices are shown. The magnitude of the values of the state-specific FC spatial maps (colorbars) correspond to the degree of connectedness of each region with the rest of brain. \n  Fig. 5   \n\n Spatial Dynamics  \n\nIn  [B], we show the state-specific FC spatial maps (corresponding to the first eigenvector of the state-specific correlation matrices) and mean activity spatial maps for each of the four inferred states. The variance spatial maps are not illustrated as there was no between-state variability in the inferred variance states (lack of time-varying content in variance). The maps are labelled according to the task conditions that their state time courses most correspond to. The state-specific FC maps for MAGE identifies appropriate active regions during each of the tasks. It can be seen during the motor task that the somatomotor area of the brain is active, and during the visual task that the visual cortex is active. During the rest task, the Default Mode Network (DMN) is active, and during the visual-motor task, both the motor and visual cortex are active. The mean activity level maps appear fairly similar and look appropriate with regards to the relevant task condition. During the visual task, the visual cortex of the brain is active, and during the motor task, the motor cortex is active for both approaches. During the rest task, DMN is active, and during the visual-motor task, only the visual cortex is active for the MAGE approach. \n\n\n### Multi-dynamic approach reveals stronger changes in FC over time in resting fMRI \n  \nThe simulations shown in   suggest that multi-dynamic approaches may be better able to identify TVFC than single-dynamic approaches, which may erroneously infer FC as being too homogeneous over time. We looked to test this idea by applying the single-dynamic (SAGE) and multi-dynamic (MAGE) approaches to resting-state fMRI data. In particular, we can analyse how the temporal dynamics of mean activity levels and FC differ (i.e.,  ,  ) when modelled independently and see if this has any effect on the inferred state-specific FC maps. Lastly, we compared MAGE results with the HMM and SWC approaches, to further substantiate our findings. \n\nWe used rfMRI data from 13,301 subjects from the UK Biobank (UKB) ( ) and 1003 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) ( ). The pre-processing pipelines for UKB and HCP main steps can be summarized as (1) motion correction, (2) removal of structural artifacts with ICA (Independent Component Analysis and FMRIB’s ICA-based X-noisefier (FIX). The length of the scanning session for UKB is 6 min, and for HCP is 1 h (4 sessions of 15 mins each). For UKB, we have 490 time-points and for HCP, we used data from all 4 sessions which gave us 4800 time points in total (1200 time points in each session). Lastly, we applied a popular data-driven parcellation scheme called spatial Group Independent Component Analysis (group-ICA) ( )  to our data to identify the parcels/channels (N) that form the data to be input into MAGE \n\n Temporal and Spatial Dynamics   We first compare the single-dynamic (SAGE) and multi-dynamic (MAGE) approaches using the HCP data, where the only difference between the two methods is whether or not we model independent state dynamics for the state means and FC (i.e., correlations). In  [A], we show the state-specific mean activity and FC correlation maps for SAGE and MAGE approaches for the HCP data. In total, we modelled P=Q=R=12 states, but we have only displayed the observation model for four of the 12 states for ease of visualisation (the results for all 12 states are illustrated in Figure S9, Figure S10, Figure S11 and Figure S12). As described earlier, MAGE also models time-varying variances, whose dynamics are tied to be the same as the mean. However, we have not displayed the state-specific spatial maps for variance as MAGE infers that there was little between-state variability in the state-specific variances (i.e., the variances remained static across states).   \n [HCP data] [A-B]   The multi-dynamic (MAGE) approach reveals stronger changes in state-specific FC maps compared to the single-dynamic (SAGE) approach. Using the HCP data, it is evident that qualitatively and quantitatively, MAGE-derived FC shows stronger changes over time.   [A]   State-specific mean activity and FC correlation maps for four of the modelled states for both approaches are shown. For the state-specific mean activity maps, the average amplitude of each node/channel is shown and for the state-specific FC maps, rank-one decomposition (first Eigenvector) of the estimated FC correlation maps are shown.   [B]   The pair-wise Riemannian distance of the state-specific FC correlation matrices between 12 FC states is shown for both MAGE and SAGE (with and without modelling the mean activity, see   as another example of modelling only the correlation, i.e.,   = 0 in  ). The stars referred to paired   t  -test values.   [C]   Correlations between the mean-derived state time-courses and the FC-derived state time-courses plotted as histogram over all pairs of states (and equivalent null scenario). The non-zero correlations indicate that the mean activity and FC have some shared dynamics but also have unique temporal dynamics.   [D]   Summary measures of the state dynamics for both approaches. It can be seen that FC state dynamics show the lowest switching rate (in Hertz) and the highest lifetimes values (in seconds) as compared to other approaches.   (E)   Example segment of a state time course of a randomly chosen subject is shown to qualitatively highlight the extent of similarity (and dissimilarity) between the mean activity and the FC state time courses. These also show how states in MAGE can overlap in time. \n  Fig. 6   \n\n [A] shows that the state-specific mean activity maps vary reasonably well across states using both SAGE and MAGE. However, with SAGE, it can be seen that the state-specific FC maps (the rank-one decomposition of the estimated state-specific correlation maps are shown to make these 2D FC maps easier to view) of all the states are predominantly similar, always resembling a somatomotor state. We also attempted another modelling option with SAGE in which we explicitly forced the mean activity to be zero  (i.e.,   = 0 in  ). This approach also resulted in homogeneous state-specific FCs as shown in Figure S13. In contrast, for the MAGE approach, we can see that the state-specific FC maps correspond to distinct brain networks, with the state-specific FCs looking more distinct from each other than in the SAGE results. To illustrate this quantitatively, we show the pairwise between-state Riemannian distance in  [B]. Specifically, we calculated these pairwise distances over the actual 2D correlation matrices (i.e., FCs). It is clear that these between-state pairwise distances are higher for the state-specific FC maps when inferred using the multi-dynamic MAGE approach, revealing stronger changes in FC over time. \n\nIn  [D], we compare summary measures of the state dynamics. Since MAGE models a linear mixture (i.e., a partial volume) at each time point, it is not straightforward to compute summary statistics normally used on binary state time courses. In order to allow us to do this we threshold the continuous partial volume state time courses (  and  ) at 0.3. Firstly, we show the state switching rate for both models, which is a measure of the frequency of state fluctuation for each subject, and it can be seen that FC-driven state time-courses,  , have the lowest switching rate. Then, we show the state lifetimes for both models, which correspond to the number of seconds per state visit. We can see that the FC-driven state time-courses have the highest values for state lifetimes (2 to 5 s) as compare to lifetimes of mean state time-courses (2 to 3 s). In  [E], we show an example segment of the state time course (of a randomly chosen subject) showing the nature of the mixing of the inferred 12 states and the degree of overlap between the mean activity and the FC state time-courses. Furthermore, in  [C], we quantitatively compare the extent of similarity between the mean activity and the FC state time courses. We plot the mean activity and the FC state time courses correlation matrices as histograms for the null and the HCP dataset. There is a significant non-zero correlation as compared to the equivalent null scenario, but there is clearly still a distinct difference between them (and hence the difference in the performance of SAGE vs MAGE). In short, the means and FCs have some shared dynamics but also some unique/independent dynamics. \n\nIt has been previously proposed that the observed estimates of TVFC must be compared against “static” null hypotheses to establish claims of non-stationary ( ). Considering that, we generated null data using autoregressive randomization (ARR) following ( ). Specifically, a 10th order Gaussian autoregressive (AR) model was applied to generate null data. For each participant and each pair of brain regions, we compared the observed between-timepoint variances of the instantaneous FCs inferred by MAGE, which can be calculated from the FC state dynamics and state-specific FCs, from the real HCP data against the null data. This analysis resulted in one p-value for each edge of the FC matrix. On average, across HCP participants (compared against null data), 95% of edges were significant ( ). Furthermore, in Figure S5, we show the histogram of null variance values compared with the real HCP data variance values (this highlights that between-brain region variability over time is significantly higher in the real HCP data as compared to null data). \n\nWe find that we get similar results to the HCP dataset when we use MAGE on the resting fMRI data from the UKB dataset. Here, we also compare the performance of MAGE with other established methods (HMM and SWC) on the UKB data-set.   shows the state-specific FC maps from MAGE, HMM and SWC, with the HMM and SWC approaches showing similar behaviour to that of SAGE in  . It is also clear that there are smaller between-state differences in FC across time for both the HMM and SWC approaches compared to MAGE (as reflected by the between-state Riemannian distance plots in  [D]), consistent again with the idea that MAGE reveals stronger changes in FC over time due to its ability to model multi-dynamics.   \n [UKB data]   Demonstration that the between-state spatial variability in state-specific FC maps is significantly higher when modelled using the MAGE approach on UKB data compared with the HMM or SWC approaches.   [A-C]   The pair-wise Riemannian distance of the state-specific FC correlation matrices between 12 FC states is shown for MAGE, HMM and SWC, alongside the FC correlation maps for 5 of the identified states. The state-specific FC maps are shown as rank-one decomposition (first Eigenvector) of the estimated state-specific FC correlation matrices. The channels with positive values (red regions) show they are positively correlated with other regions, whereas channels with negative values (blue regions) show they are negatively correlated with other regions. The state-specific FC maps for all 12 states using SWC, HMM and MAGE are illustrated in Figure S14, Figure S15, and Figure S16 respectively.   [D]   The between-state Riemannian distance for the modelled 12 states, shown for MAGE, SWC and HMM. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n  Fig. 7   \n\nTo ensure that the MAGE estimated FC and mean activity states are reproducible, we ran MAGE six times on different non-overlapping subsets of UKB data (2k subjects for each run). In  [A,B], we compare the similarity between MAGE estimated state-specific spatial maps across the six runs. Specifically, in  [A], we show the average correlation plot for the state-specific FC estimates across repeated runs, and in  [B] for the state-specific mean activity estimates, both for a fixed number of states (P=Q=12). This shows that the state-specific FCs are very reproducible and that the state-specific mean activity estimates are moderately reproducible but not to the same extent. We then replicated these reproducibility findings for a wide range of numbers of states (1 to 24) for the FC and mean activity, as shown in  [C], also demonstrating that P does not have to be equal to Q. We show in  [C] that the FC are mostly highly and mean activity are mostly moderately reproducible independent of the number of modelled states. Specifically, mean activity and functional connectivity states are more reproducible if the number of modelled states is more than approximately six.   \n [UKB data]   MAGE estimated FC and mean activity spatial maps are reproducible across various runs on different non-overlapping sets of subjects.   [A]   shows the average correlation between the state-specific FCs across six repeated runs. Moreover, for runs 1 and 2, FC correlation maps are shown for 4 of the identified states (out of the 12 inferred states), demonstrating that the FC states are consistent across repeated runs. On the other hand,   [B]   shows the average correlation plot for the state-specific mean activity estimates across six repeated runs, alongside the mean activity spatial maps (for runs 1 and 2 only). The analysis in   [A]   and   [B]   is performed for a fixed number of states (P = Q = 12), whereas, in   [C]  , we evaluated the reproducibility of state-specific FC and mean activity estimates by varying the total number of modelled states (P, Q). Specifically,   [C]   shows the correlation plots for the state-specific FCs and state-specific mean activity estimates, where we varied the total number of inferred states (P and Q) from 1 to 24. These results suggest that inferred states for the FC are highly and mean activity are moderately reproducible independent of the number of modelled states (Note the difference in the ranges of the colormaps).   [D]   We replicated the original findings of ( ) and illustrate that hierarchical meta-state structure exists both in the functional connectivity and the mean activity states, but is more well-defined in the mean activity states (matrices computed as  , where   is the [number of states by number of subjects] fractional occupancy matrix). \n  Fig. 8   \n\nIt has been previously reported in   that the brain network activity is organized into a hierarchy of two distinct meta-states, with one meta-state representing hisgher-order cognition, and the other representing the sensorimotor systems. We have taken a similar approach as  , and computed [P x d] or [Q x d] matrices containing the fractional occupancy (time spent in each state) for each subject, where d is the number of subjects. We then use these to compute the [P x P] or [Q x Q] correlation matrices over subjects, which are shown in  [D]. As in  ,  [D] shows that a hierarchical meta-state structure is present. Here, it is apparent in both in the functional connectivity and the mean activity driven state time-courses, although it is more apparent in the mean activity state time-courses. \n\n\n### Multi-dynamic TVFC predicts behavioural variability better than the single-dynamic approaches \n  \nWe next used the UKB data to see if the multi-dynamic MAGE approach provides spatial network features (i.e., the state-specific FCs) that can be used to predict individual behavioural traits, and we compare its performance to the HMM and SWC approaches. Alongside the task fMRI results, this would provide further evidence that the state dynamics being inferred by MAGE are cognitively meaningful. \n\nWe applied the dual-estimation method to obtain subject-level estimates of TVFC. This means that for each subject, we can obtain a set of state-specific FC maps (Q * N * N), where Q is the number of correlation (FC) states and N is the number of channels/brain regions. Then, we can use these subject-level, state-specific FC estimates to predict selected behavioural variables. The classifier/predictor we employed is Elastic Net ( ), which is a regularized regression method that combines the penalties of lasso   and ridge   methods ( ). The data matrix fed into the classifier is d*[Q*f], where d is the number of subjects, Q is the number of states and f is the number of features. The state-specific FC matrices are symmetric and only values above the diagonal need to be retained and vectorized, and hence f = N(N-1)/2. Lastly, we concatenated the state-by-state subject-level, state-specific FC estimates, resulting in Q*f features for each subject. We performed this prediction analysis for UKB data with d = 13301, Q = 12, and N = 25. \n\nWe used four non-imaging variables to compare the performance of multi-dynamic (MAGE) approach with HMM and SWC. The details for the SWC and HMM approaches are explained in the Section S1.3 and Section S1.4 respectively. These variables are age, sex, fluid intelligence score, and neuroticism score. In  [A], we display the prediction results (nested 10-fold cross-validated) from the subject-level FC estimates. We can see that the FC obtained using the MAGE approach is a more accurate predictor of behaviour as compared to the other approaches   \nMulti-dynamic (MAGE) derived state-specific FCs are used to predict non-imaging variables in the UKB data.   [A]   The prediction performance of MAGE-derived state-specific FCs compared with the HMM and SWC approaches. The prediction accuracy/correlation is estimated using the combined features by concatenating the state-specific FC estimates from all states. Y-axis shows the prediction correlation (age, fluid intelligence, neuroticism) and prediction accuracy (sex), and the x-axis shows the predicted variable. To draw the confidence intervals on the prediction accuracies for sex variable (discrete output), we performed the Wilson test (suitable for the binomial distribution). Lastly, to generate confidence intervals on the prediction correlations (i.e., continuous outputs e.g., age, fluid intelligence and neuroticism), we computed the Fisher transformation ( ).   [B]   Comparison of the prediction performance of MAGE-derived state-specific FCs with the time-averaged FC. The bars in red colour show the prediction correlation/accuracy using time-averaged FC estimates, whereas bars in green show the increased/decreased prediction correlation/accuracy using state-specific FC estimates. The numbers in red bars represent the percentage in the change of performance using the state-specific FCs as compared to time-averaged FC. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) \n  Fig. 9   \n\n\n### Static FC is worse than multi-dynamic TVFC at predicting behaviour \n  \nTime-averaged FC (static) can be considered as an average of all state-specific FC states (and the time varying means) and is conventionally estimated simply by taking a full (Pearson) correlation between brain parcels over the whole scanning time. Unlike TVFC in the form of the state-specific FCs, time-averaged FC is a single FC estimate per subject and is already an established predictor of behavioural traits ( ). In  [B], we compare the combined power of the state-specific FCs with the time-averaged FC. This shows that for the mental health variables, predictive performance is improved by using the state-specific FCs in comparison to time-averaged FC. We employed Elastic Net for this comparison and the reported results are nested 10-fold cross-validated. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe have proposed a novel algorithm, MAGE, that reliably infers the time-point by time-point estimates of FC. Notably, MAGE frees up the dynamics of the FC to fluctuate independently from the dynamics of the means and variances of the brain activity. We found that this multi-dynamic approach reveals much stronger changes in FC over time than existing single-dynamic approaches (e.g., HMM, SWC), and is a better predictor of individual behavioural variability. This provides a potential explanation and solution as to why time-varying FC has appeared to look so stable in resting fMRI data in previous work ( ,  ). \n\n MAGE inferred multi-dynamic linear mixtures of FC states.   We assessed the performance of MAGE on simulations where there can be more than one underlying state active at each time point ( ). We demonstrated that categorical models, such as the HMM, under-performed as expected when applied to such simulations. In contrast, MAGE remained accurate across a range of these simulations. MAGE also shows improved performance in simulations designed to be suitable for categorical models (e.g., HMM), i.e., by having only one state active at each time point (mutual exclusivity) (Figure S3). This suggests that MAGE performance remained stable when the state time-courses have long-range temporal dependencies (i.e., violate the HMM Markovian assumption) (Figure S3[D]). Lastly, we assessed the performance on the multi-dynamic simulations and demonstrated that MAGE accurately identified unique dynamics of the correlations when the ground truth was that the correlations and mean activity dynamics were distinct from each other ( ). \n\n MAGE learned network state dynamics that showed appropriate task dependencies.   Following rigorous performance evaluation of MAGE on more than a thousand simulations, we applied it to a task fMRI dataset. The rationale was that task fMRI gives an opportunity to assess the specific state dynamics that MAGE infers, by comparing them to the known task timings. In  , we demonstrated that the FC-driven time courses performed well in terms of displaying task-dependencies as compared to the mean-driven state time courses when using MAGE. Moreover, we showed in  [B] that plausible time-varying representations of FC and mean activity spatial maps were inferred using the MAGE approach. This suggests that the inferred TVFC is powerful enough to capture the dynamics in cognitive tasks, and is not static during these task experiments. \n\n Why do we model the mean of the brain activity separately from the functional connectivity?   Our assumption in   is that the mean and the FC (i.e., the correlation matrix) continuously vary over time. From that perspective, there is no imperative to assume that the dynamics of those two entities are the same as each other. As such, MAGE is designed to explore what happens when we do not tie the dynamics together. By allowing the state dynamics of the mean and FC to be independent of each other, MAGE also allows them to potentially operate on different time scales. However, in real fMRI data, we found that the dynamics of the mean states and the FC states ended up on fairly similar time-scales (between 2 to 5 s for FC states and 2 to 3 s for mean activity states, as shown in  ). It is also interesting to consider the extent to which the state dynamics of the mean and FC get inferred as being coupled together, despite being free to be inferred as completely independent.  [C] demonstrated that there was indeed some significant non-zero correlation between the two types of dynamics. However, this correspondence between the dynamics of the mean and the dynamics of the FC was not absolute. In other words, the fluctuations in the FC clearly have some unique temporal structure that is not shared with the fluctuations in the mean of the activity. Indeed, the benefit of capturing these unique fluctuations was demonstrated by the improved performance of MAGE (versus SAGE) in inferring stronger fluctuations in FC over time and in predicting behavioural traits. \n\n Why does MAGE reveal stronger functional connectivity dynamics in resting-state fMRI?   Our results demonstrated that MAGE revealed stronger changes in FC over time than single-dynamic approaches, where changes in FC over time correspond to between-state differences in the state-specific FCs (e.g., HMM, SWC, SAGE, see   and  ). The lack of change in FC over time in single-dynamic approaches has been observed in other, recent studies ( ,  ,  ). Indeed, in some cases, it has been observed that the reported variability in the FC from one state to another state (or against null models) is statistically insignificant ( ). So why does MAGE show comparatively stronger changes in FC over time? We can gain insight into the multi-dynamic model being used in MAGE, by considering a dynamic version of structural equation modelling (SEM), as explained in  . This shows that if the underlying truth is that there are distinct dynamics for the external driving inputs and connectivity, then distinct dynamics are needed for the mean activity and FC modelled by MAGE. If we were to ignore this, and use a single dynamic approach (e.g., HMM, SAGE, SWC) then we will infer common state dynamics that are a compromise. In turn, use of these incorrect state dynamics will tend to cause the inferred FC patterns to be temporally smeared versions of the true FC patterns, causing them to look more homogeneous over time. We demonstrated this phenomenon with a simple example ( [B]), in which we simulated a ground truth where the FC dynamics and the mean activity dynamics were not tied together. Using SAGE on this data substantially reduced the inferred change in instantaneous FC over time, whereas MAGE better captured the true variability in instantaneous FC across time. This work provides a potential explanation as to why FC in resting fMRI has previously appeared to look so homogeneous over time ( ,  ,  ). \n\n Reproducibility of MAGE states.   The presented results in   demonstrated that the MAGE estimated FC states are highly and mean activity states are moderately reproducible across re-runs on non-overlapping subsets of the data (shown quantitatively and qualitatively in  [A,B]). Also, as is typical with other unsupervised learning methods (e.g., ICA, HMM), the number of states to be modelled is an empirical parameter in our method and it needs to be chosen before running the model. In most of our presented work, we modelled anywhere from 4 to 16 states, though we had experimented with up-to 64 states in the resting-state and task data (and the results remained sensible). In  [C], we found out the estimated states are more consistent across re-runs when the number of modelled states is more than six. Considering that, we suggest that the number of modelled states to be more than approximately six for such dynamic modelling (though we do not have a strong recommendation for an exact number of states). \n\n Multi-dynamic TVFC predicted behavioural variability better than existing methods.   We evaluated whether the inter-individual differences inferred by MAGE are meaningful. We demonstrated in  [A] that the MAGE-estimated, state-specific FCs did a better job at predicting these non-imaging variables as compared to SWC and HMM approaches. For example, age was predicted with an average correlation of 0.50 using MAGE as compared to 0.46 using HMM, and 0.36 using SWC. This provides evidence that the TVFC estimated using the MAGE is a more accurate and meaningful representation of underlying functional networks and is indeed a powerful biomarker for cognitive traits. \n\n Static FC is worse than Multi-dynamic TVFC at predicting behaviour.   In  [B], we compared the predictive power of MAGE-derived, state-specific FCs versus time-averaged FC, and demonstrated the prediction performance on mental-health related variables in UKB data. We have demonstrated that the prediction accuracy of these behavioural variables increased when TVFC was used, as compared to time-averaged FC e.g., for work/job satisfaction, prediction accuracy was improved by 20.2% and for depressed for a week, accuracy was improved by 19.5%, etc. This highlights that there are some aspects of behaviour that can be best explained using TVFC estimates. The better performance of time-varying FC in terms of behavioural variability might be because it should not contain as much potential confounding anatomical information as compared to time-averaged FC ( ); however, further detailed work is require to understand and address this issue. \n\n What do we mean by TVFC?   We can gain insight into the multi-dynamic model being proposed, by considering a dynamic version of structural equation modelling (SEM) as explained in  . The SEM perspective ( ) suggests that the instantaneous FC is the closest representation that we have to the time-varying connectivity in a dynamic SEM ( ). In MAGE, we have assumed that the instantaneous FC,  , is the TVFC measure of most interest. MAGE provides a regularised estimate of the instantaneous FC, and so in this paper we have represented the instantaneous FC parsimoniously using the state-specific FCs. Hence, in this work we have focussed on the state-specific FCs as our main measure of TVFC, e.g., for predicting behavioural traits. However, a more complete representation of TVFC includes the FC state time courses alongside the state-specific FCs (after all, we combine the state-specific FCs with the FC state time courses via   to get the instantaneous FC). As such, prediction may be improved further in the future by including features describing the FC state dynamics. For example, we can already show that inter-individual differences for the time spent in each FC state are linked to behavioural traits, as illustrated in Figure S8. MAGE also provides other potential features for use in prediction, for example, the mean-activity FC (i.e., correlations of the mean activity,  , over all time) or the state-specific mean activity and the mean-derived dynamics. In this paper, we have not looked into the details of mean-activity FC but mean-activity FC has been assessed in the literature. For example,   highlights that the spatiotemporal organization of brain activity correlates with the presence of diagnosed schizophrenia, as well as with gender and age. \n\n Variance of the brain activity.   We found through resting-state and task data-sets results (  and  ) that there was not much between-state variability in the variance of the activity, and the variance remained static over the scanning session. Nevertheless, we explored another configuration where dynamics of the variance of the activity was modelled with independent state dynamics from the mean activity and the FC, but that also did not result in any meaningful variability in the variance of the activity (though it is computationally more expensive to learn the variance state time courses separately). We also attempted to model state dynamics of the variance of the activity tied to the state dynamics of the FC fluctuations, but independently from the mean activity; however, this resulted in comparatively less between-state variability in the FC. In summary, we found out there was little between-state variability in the state-specific variances irrespective of the modelling choice. \n\nIn summary, we proposed a multi-dynamic approach (MAGE) that models temporal fluctuations in functional connectivity independently from fluctuations in the mean of the activity. Multi-dynamic modelling provided an explanation and a solution as to why resting fMRI FC has previously looked so stable and homogeneous. We found out that that separating fluctuations in the mean activity levels from those in the functional connectivity reveals much stronger changes in functional connectivity over time. Lastly, MAGE estimated time-varying FC is a better predictor of behavioural variability in the resting-state fMRI data than established methods. \n\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement \n  \n Usama Pervaiz:   Data curation, Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Validation, Visualization.
