# Dynamic Functional Connectivity methods

The focus of this project is to explore how methods for estimating Dynamic Functional Connectivity (DFC) are used in the literature.
Related code and documentation can be found in a dedicated GitHub [repository](https://github.com/neurodatascience/dfc_text_mining).

The documents have been collected with **pubget** and the whole **pubget** output can be found on [OSF](https://osf.io/2ekbd).
