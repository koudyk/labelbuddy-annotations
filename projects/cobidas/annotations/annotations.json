Recently, there has been growing interest in using neuroimaging techniques to explore brain structural and functional alterations in bulimia nervosa, but the findings of previous studies have a great number of inconsistencies. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nHere, we collected anatomical and resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 43 bulimia nervosa patients and 34 matched healthy controls (HCs). We applied a surface‐based morphology analysis to explore brain cortical morphology differences and a novel surface‐based functional connectivity (FC) analysis to investigate functional abnormalities. Principal component analysis was performed to analyze the behavioral data of the participants. We further analyzed the relationships between abnormalities in cortical characteristics or FC and clinical features. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe observed increased greater sulcal depth in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the right medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) in bulimia nervosa patients than in the HCs. Additionally, the patients exhibited increased FC between the right STG and right ventral tegmental area but decreased function between the right mOFC and right putamen, which was significantly negatively correlated with the first principal component reflecting the severity of bulimia nervosa symptom. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur findings provide evidence of neuroanatomical and functional abnormalities in bulimia nervosa patients. Moreover, the FC between the right mOFC and right putamen was associated with symptom severity of bulimia nervosa, which may be a neural marker and involved in the neuropathological mechanism of bulimia nervosa. \n\n  \nWe conducted a novel surface‐based FC analysis based on surface morphology alterations in BN, PCA to analyze the behavioral data of the participants and further explored the relationships between neuroimaging findings and principal component. Altered FC based on surface morphology alterations was related with related to the severity of BN symptom. Our findings provided further evidence that reward processing and body image processing may be involved in BN.\n   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nBulimia nervosa (BN) is a complex psychiatric and psychological disorder with a typical onset in adolescence or early adulthood and primarily affects females, and long‐term patients can experience serious medical complications affecting the whole‐body system. The cardinal symptoms of BN are recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by self‐induced vomiting or another inappropriate compensatory behavior and negative self‐evaluation of body shape and weight (American Psychiatric Association,  ). Clinical treatment of BN remains a significant challenge, with only less than half of the patients exhibiting prolonged remission (Hagan & Walsh,  ). A better understanding of neurobiological processes involved in BN will facilitate the development of new interventions. \n\nPrevious neuroimaging studies have provided supporting evidence demonstrating that BN is related to brain structural and functional changes. For example, previous studies adopting voxel‐based morphology (VBM) analyses have associated BN with altered gray matter (GM) volume (GMV) in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), striatum, and insula, which are related to processing reward information and/or self‐regulation (Frank et al.,  ; Schafer et al.,  ). Another study found reduced GMV in the superior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus (STG), and cingulate and paracingulate gyri, which may be associated with impaired inhibitory control and self‐body dissatisfaction (Li et al.,  ). These studies revealed correlations between BN and brain structures to some extent; however, these studies adopted VBM analyses, which are thought to neglect the intrinsic geometry of the highly folded human cortex. Surface‐based morphology (SBM) analyses provide a better alignment of cortical landmarks to explore whether structural variability on the cortical surface is related to BN. Some brain structural studies using SBM analyses have found cortical abnormalities in BN, such as reduced cortical thickness, volumetric reductions in local brain regions, and localized deformations on the surface of subcortical structures, but concluded that there is a high level of heterogeneity and inconsistency across these studies (Berner et al.,  ,  ,  ,  ; Marsh et al.,  ; Westwater et al.,  ). In addition, few investigations have used a combined strategy to assess the differences in cortical morphology and associated functional connectivity (FC) differences in BN patients compared to healthy controls (HCs). An algorithm for surface‐based FC was developed to calculate vertex‐wise FC between regions of interest (ROIs) and to compare the differences between BN patients and HCs (Brodoehl et al.,  ). The algorithm proposed an inflated original cerebral surface map of neuronal activity in the sulci and on the gyri, which also avoided disturbances from white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signals. Moreover, the algorithm reduced the false positives of activation around the boundaries of adjacent but functionally separated brain regions, which were probably identified in the volume‐based analyses. \n\nThus, in the present research, we conducted an SBM analysis and examined surface‐based FC analysis to further illustrate the functional changes based on neuroanatomical variations and to understand how brain areas interact with one another. The purpose was to clarify the cortical morphology abnormalities in BN patients, and we further hypothesized that the FC abnormalities would emerge in the regions identified in the regional SBM analysis, according to the previous neuroimaging studies of BN. In exploratory analyses, we also assessed whether correlations existed between clinical traits and possible FC differences based on surface morphology abnormalities in BN. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nA total of 43 patients diagnosed with BN and 34 HCs, comparable in age, sex, handedness, and educational level, participated in this study. Patients were recruited in the outpatient clinic department of the Eating Disorders Unit in the hospital. We recruited HCs with normal weight and without any history of mental illness via the internet. All study subjects were right‐handed. The BN patients were clinically diagnosed by two clinical psychiatrists, one of whom was an expert in eating disorders, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM‐5) criteria for BN. We used the Mini‐International Neuropsychiatric Interview to exclude subjects with any potential psychiatric illness among the HCs (Sheehan et al.,  ). Among the 43 patients, 9 had a history of anorexia nervosa and 12 had a history of antidepressant medication, but none of them have used any psychotropic drugs within the last 2 months before the MRI examination. Of those patients, six have depressive symptoms, eight have anxiety symptoms, and six have obsessive–compulsive symptoms. Specific exclusion criteria were currently diagnosed with other severe psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dissociative disorder, substance abuse disorder within the last year, and so on; the previous history of brain surgery and neurologic disorders; pervasive developmental disorder and intellectual disability; the history of significant health problems, such as endocrine disorders (including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hyperthyroidism); claustrophobia, pregnancy, lactation, and metallic implants (including pacemakers and nonremovable metal dental retainers). \n\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Beijing Friendship hospital (the approval number is 2021‐P2‐052‐01) and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki ethical standards. All subjects provided written informed consent. \n\n\n### Behavioral assessments \n  \nBefore arrival at the scanning visit, all participants were asked to fast for at least 4 h. All participants were asked to complete several self‐report questionnaires before the MRI acquisition scan. The participants rated their current hunger intensity using a visual analog scale (VAS) scored from 0 indicating “not at all” to 10 indicating “extremely.” The study participants completed the Chinese version of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) consisting of restrained, emotional, and external eating subscales to assess their eating behavior (Wu et al.,  ). A total of 33 items of the DEBQ are completed on a 5‐point scale that ranges from 1 “never” to 5 “very often.” The Eating Disorder Inventory‐I (EDI‐I) and Eating Attitudes Test (EAT‐26) were used to measure participants’ symptoms and concerns characteristic of eating disorders (Kang et al.,  ; Lee et al.,  ). We assessed depressive and anxiety symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory‐II (BDI‐II) and self‐rating anxiety scale (SAS), respectively (Shek,  ; Zung,  ). The Chinese version of these scales has good reliability and validity and can be used as effective tools for the evaluation of eating disorders among Chinese people (Kang et al.,  ; Lee et al.,  ; Mo et al.,  ; Shek,  ; Wu et al.,  ; Zung,  ). \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nAll participants were scanned on a Siemens Prisma 3.0 T MRI system (Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 64‐channel head coil. We used a conventional axial T2 sequence to exclude participants with any possible brain abnormalities. High‐resolution anatomical MRI datasets with 192 1.0 mm contiguous sagittal slices for all participants were acquired using a T1‐weighted, three‐dimensional, magnetization‐prepared rapid gradient‐echo sequence (echo time [TE], 2.98 ms; repetition time [TR], 2530 ms; inversion time, 1100 ms; flip angle [FA], 7°; bandwidth, 240 Hz/Px; isotropic voxel size, 1 × 1 × 1 mm ; data matrix, 256 × 256; and field of view [FOV], 256 × 256 mm ). The resting‐state functional MRI images were obtained using an echo‐planar imaging sequence (TE, 30 ms; TR, 2000 ms; FA, 90°; bandwidth, 2368 Hz/Px; FOV, 224 × 224 mm ; data matrix, 64 × 64; number of slices, 33; slice thickness, 3.5 mm; interslice gap, 1 mm; and total volumes, 240). \n\nTo reduce imaging noise and minimize head motion, we used tight but comfortable earplugs and foam padding around the subject's head throughout the entire 16‐min scanning process (8 min for resting‐state scan). The participants were instructed to rest with their eyes closed but stay awake and avoid specific thoughts. After each sequence scan, we confirmed the participant's status, and all reported that they had not fallen asleep during the entire scanning process. \n\n\n### Anatomical and resting‐state functional data preprocessing \n  \nThe structural image preprocessing used the computational anatomy toolbox (CAT12,  ) that was implemented in the Statistical Parametric Mapping analysis package (SPM12 version,  ). Steps included (1) denoising using spatially adaptive nonlocal means filter; (2) tissue segmentation for CSF, WM, and GM volumetric structures; (3) spherical correction of the GM–WM interface and the GM–CSF interface where triangular mesh tessellation was adapted to smoothly and perfectly represent WM surface and pial surface; (4) spatial normalization transforming individual native space to fsaverage stereotaxic space; (5) deformation estimation and the registration from an inflated spherical mesh of individual brain to common spherical coordinate system (HCP fsLR32k). \n\nThe functional image preprocessing implementing fMRIprep ( )(Esteban et al.,  ) and xcp‐Engine ( )(Ciric et al.,  ) included the following steps: (1) motion correction using the flirt function of FSL; (2) slice timing correction for each volume; (3) 4D global mean‐based intensity normalization; (4) coregistration of individual structural and functional brain images by the boundary‐based registration algorithm of FreeSurfer; (5) projection of individual preprocessed rsfMRI images of each time point to the standard cortical surface (fsaverage5); (6) transformation of images from fsaverage5 space to HCP fsLR32k space for higher resolution and a symmetric left‐to‐right parcellation; (7) interpolation of intensity outliers in each vertex's time series using AFNI's 3dDespike utility, demeaning and removal of any linear or quadratic trends was further applied; (8) nuisance regression with 36 regressors from fMRIPrep outputs after filtering and excluding outliers (framewise displacement [FD] > 0.3). Regressors included 6 head motion measures, the global signal, the mean WM signal, the mean CSF signal, and the temporal derivatives of these 12 parameters, as well as 18 quadratic expansions of 6 motion measures, 3 signals, and 9 derivatives (Ciric et al., 2017,  ); (9) bandpass filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz) was further applied to residual time series from the regression; (10) finally, the data were smoothed with the Connectome Workbench and a kernel size of 6.0 mm. Given the intergroup differences in movement parameters that can confound resting‐state fMRI results, we compare the FD of movement parameters between the groups and found no significant differences between groups (  t   = −.85, degrees of freedom = 68, and   p   = .396). For the detailed preprocessing steps for fMRI data, please refer to Supporting Information  . \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Clinical data analysis \n  \nFour HCs were excluded due to nonremovable metal dental retainers and claustrophobia during fMRI scanning, and one patient and two HCs were excluded due to FD > 0.2; none was excluded for neuroanatomical abnormality; a total of 42 BN patients (2 males) and 28 HCs (2 males) were finally included in the analysis. The baseline demographic information and clinical characteristics were analyzed using SPSS 25.0 software. Between‐group comparisons were performed using independent two‐sample   t  ‐tests or chi‐square tests, as appropriate.   p   < .05 was considered statistically significant. Continuous variables are presented as the mean with 95% confidence intervals. \n\nAdditionally, we used principal component analysis (PCA), a dimensionality‐reduction method for related multivariate analyses, to analyze the behavioral data of the participants. PCA was performed to explore the degree of association and capture the commonality purely within the behavioral questionnaires. More specifically, the nine scores from the seven questionnaires, including the VAS, number of binge‐eating times per week, DEBQ, EDI‐BN, EAT, BDI, and SAS, were included in the PCA. The components with a high ratio of variance and eigenvalue greater than 1 were reserved in the PCA (Boehmke & Greenwell,  ). \n\n\n#### SBM analysis \n  \nSBM analyses of cortical indicators (thickness, surface area, volume, mean curvature, and sulcal depth) were automatically performed using CAT 12 to measure different properties of brain cortical surface morphology (Luders et al.,  ). Cortical thickness is the averaged linking distance between the pial and WM surfaces along the normal vector. Surface area refers to each vertex as the average area of the triangles that surround it. Volume is defined as the product of cortical thickness and surface area. The curvature at each vertex is calculated by averaging the maximum and minimum bending of the cortical surface. Sulcal depth is defined as the product of the displacement and regular unit vector in the process of the expansion of the cortex and is used for quantifying the large‐scale geometric information of the cortex. Finally, 22‐mm full width at half maximum smoothing to the resampled surface data for all metrics was applied. A two‐sample   t   test and a cluster‐based familywise error (FWE) correction with   k   = 144 and   p   < .05 were further applied to the results of all metrics with age controlled for through CAT12. \n\n\n#### Calculation of surface‐based functional connectivity \n  \nROIs identified in the SBM analysis were used as seeds to compute FC with each vertex on the surface and voxel in subcortical regions through the Pearson correlations. A Fisher‐  z   transformation was used for subsequent statistics. Surfstat was conducted to investigate the intergroup differences between the BNs and HCs by a two‐sample   t  ‐test with the regression of age, educational level, and mean FD values (Worsley et al.,  ). The results of surface‐based FC were reserved through cluster‐based false discovery rate (FDR) (uncorrected vertex wise   p   < .001, cluster wise   p   < .05) correction in Surfstat, and voxel‐based subcortical FC was corrected with voxel‐wise FDR (  p   < .05) correction in MATLAB, respectively. \n\n\n#### Correlation analyses between clinical variables and both SBM and FC values \n  \nThe correlation analysis was subsequently conducted to test associations between behaviors and both FC and SBM metrics by a multiple variable linear regression model (lm function in R), with the covariates age and sex controlled. Group information was also included in regression models to test the interaction effect between brain features and group categories for BNs or HCs. First, we construct full models that take the FC and SBM results (along with covariates) as independent variables. The four best models were separately determined by the backward solution method implemented in the step function of the stats package for PC1‐FC, PC1‐SBM, PC2‐FC, and PC2‐SBM. Finally, only models of PC1‐FC and PC1‐SBM were reserved after the Bonferroni correction (please refer to Supporting Information   for details). In addition, we further tested whether a correlation existed between SBM findings and the corresponding FC in the BN group through linear regression. \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Baseline and behavioral characteristics \n  \nTable   shows the descriptive statistics for the demographic and behavioral data of all participants. The results were considered significantly different at the level of   p   < .05 (two‐tailed), and the two groups did not differ for the demographic data (sex, age, BMI, and fasting hours). The EAT‐26, EDI‐BN, DEBQ, BDI, and SAS scores in the BN group were higher than those in the HC group. \n  \nBaseline demographics and clinical characteristics \n    \nPCA identified that the first two principal components were significant, with   R   values of .561 and .115, hence cumulatively explaining 67.6% of the variation in the dataset (see Figure  ). Figure   shows the two‐dimensional loadings plot (correlation scaled). The first component (PC1) showed strong correlations (range   r   = .72–.94) with emotion‐related symptoms and binge/purging frequency, including binge/purging times per week and DEBQ‐emotional, DEBQ‐restraint, EDI‐BN, EAT, BDI, and SAS scores, whereas the second principal component (PC2) was correlated with VAS scores (  r   = .98) (see Figure  ). \n  \nPart (a) shows latent dimensions of behavioral traits in the bulimia nervosa (BN) group. Part (b) shows a loadings plot (correlation scaled) for principal component analysis (PCA) of eating behavior and psychological trait questionnaire scale scores: Principal component (PC)1 denotes the first principal component that explained 56.1% of the sample variance, and PC2 denotes the second component that explained 11.5% of the sample variance. Part (c) shows the correlation analysis matrix of the PCA components and all questionnaire scores. PC1 showed strong correlations (  p   > .7) with emotion‐related symptoms and binge‐eating frequency, whereas the PC2 was correlated with visual analog scale (VAS) scores.

Figure   shows a pseudocolor map of the   t  ‐value distribution across the whole brain, which represents the group differences in sulcal depth. The patients with BN displayed significantly greater sulcal depth values in the right STG (  t   = 5.13,   p   = .001) and right mOFC (  t   = 4.0,   p   = .039) than the HCs (corrected with FWE,   p   < .05; but the right mOFC failed to be corrected by more rigorous Bonferroni correction,   p   < .01) (see Figure  ). Table   shows the cluster sizes and peak values in the two brain regions. \n  \nA pseudocolor map of the   t   value distribution across the whole brain, which represents the group differences in sulcal depth; the color bar indicates the voxel‐wise   t  ‐values. \n    \n(a–c) Clusters that significantly varied in terms of sulcal depth in the bulimia nervosa (BN) group versus the healthy control (HC) group. The patients with BN had a significantly greater sulcal depth in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and right medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) than the HCs (familywise error [FWE] correction,   p   < .05). The color bar indicates the voxel‐wise   t  ‐values. \n    \nBetween‐group difference on sulcal depth \n    \n\n### Group differences in surface‐based FC between the BN group and HC group \n  \nThe FC results revealed that, compared with the HCs, the BN group exhibited increased FC between the right STG and right ventral tegmental area (VTA) but decreased FC between the right OFC and right putamen (see Table  , Figure  ). \n  \nIntergroup functional connectivity (FC) differences for the right medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) \n      \n(a and c) Raincloud plots show the intergroup mean   z   values of functional connectivity (FC) between the right medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and right putamen and between the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and right ventral tegmental area (VTA). ( ) (Axial views) shows the intergroup differences in FC between the right mOFC and STG. The blue line illustrates the decreased FC between the right mOFC and right putamen (bulimia nervosa [BN] < healthy controls [HCs]). The red line illustrates the increased FC between the right STG and right VTA (BN > HCs). The results were corrected at   p   < .05 with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. \n  \n\n### Correlation analyses between clinical variables and SBM results and FC values \n  \nIn the FC‐behavior correlation analysis, the general linear regression model of PC1‐FC was reserved with   F   = 26.69 (  p   < .001) and adjusted   R   = .804. A significant interaction effect was found, as PC1 was significantly negatively correlated with FC between the right mOFC and right putamen in the BN group (  r   = −.302,   p   = .019), but not in the HC group (not significant,   r   = .160,   p   = .223) (see Table  , Figure  ). In addition, we performed moderation analysis with the interaction package to assess the effect of PC1 (independent variable) on FC (dependent variable) in the BN and HC group. We found the interaction effect on PC1 between group and FC is significant. There is a significant negative correlation between FC of the right mOFC‐right putamen and PC1 on the BN group but not significant on the HC group (see Table  ). Furthermore, there were no significant correlations between the increased sulcal depth and their corresponding FC in the BN group. \n  \nThe general linear regression model of PC1‐functional connectivity (FC) \n      \nThe bulimia nervosa (BN) group exhibited a significant negative correlation between principal component (PC)1 and functional connectivity (FC), between the right medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and right putamen (  r   = −.302,   p   = .019), whereas the healthy control (HC) group showed a positive correlation (not significant,   r   = .160,   p   = .223). \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this study, we demonstrated that, compared with HCs, BN patients displayed increased sulcal depth in the right mOFC and right STG. We further analyzed the surface‐based FC differences of the right mOFC and right STG to understand how the brain areas interact with one another. The present results revealed that the BN group exhibited increased FC between the right STG and right VTA but decreased FC between the right mOFC and the right putamen. However, there were no significant correlations between the increased sulcal depth and their corresponding FC in the patients with BN. For the brain and behavioral correlation analysis, the PC1 component performed significantly negatively correlated with FC between the right mOFC and right putamen in the BN group but showed a positive correlation in the HC group. \n\nIncreased sulcal depths in the right mOFC and STG were found in our study, but the increased sulcal depths were not significantly correlated with the corresponding FC in the BN group. Our findings expand the current understanding of structural alterations implicating the OFC and STG in BN (Frank et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Schafer et al.,  ; Westwater et al.,  ). However, we did not find morphological changes in cortical thickness, surface area, or subcortical shape abnormalities as did previous SBM studies, which might be due to sample limitations, including course, the severity of disease, and other related factors (Berner et al.,  ,  ; Marsh et al.,  ). Sulcal depth is an important marker of brain anatomy in neuroscience, which can provide the information about the shape of cortical surface and reflect cortical folding features (Im et al.,  ; Lyu et al.,  ). Therefore, the increased sulcal depth in the BN group may be a sensitive surface parameter and related to disease development to some extent in BN. To date, the cause for the increased sulcal depth in the right mOFC and STG in BN remains unclear, and the underlying mechanisms are likely to be very complex. One potential explanation is the effects of long‐term recurrent binge eating/purging in the BN groups, which need to be tested further. \n\nThe mOFC has been associated with food avoidance and plays an important role in food intake control and satiety (Monteleone et al.,  ; Plassmann et al.,  ; Rolls,  ). Previous VBM studies reported increased GMVs in the mOFC and striatum in BN patients compared with HCs (Frank et al.,  ; Schafer et al.,  ). Some fMRI findings demonstrated hypoactivity in the mOFC in BN patients when viewing and tasting food cues, and this attenuated response was related to the frequency of binge‐eating/purging episodes in BN (Frank et al.,  ; Uher, et al.,  ). It is likely that structural and functional changes in the OFC directly contribute to the occurrence and maintenance of BN. In our study, decreased FC between the right putamen and right mOFC was observed in the BN patients. The dorsal striatum, including the putamen and caudate nucleus is one of the important brain regions involved in the regulation of the brain reward system. The results of a previous VBM study suggested that brain structural alterations in the mOFC and dorsal striatum in BN were involved in the brain circuity assessing reward value, and alterations in the putamen were correlated with sensitivity to reward (Frank et al.,  ). A recent resting‐state fMRI study also reported disrupted resting‐state FC of putamen subregions in BN (Wang et al.,  ). Another event‐related fMRI study, involving the performance of a no‐go task, found that BN patients showed decreased activation in the right dorsal striatum and the right sensorimotor area, including the post‐ and precentral gyri (Skunde et al.,  ). Taken together, brain structure in the right mOFC and associated FC are altered in BN and suggest altered brain circuitry that has been associated with reward value. Moreover, we found that reduced FC between the right mOFC and right putamen was linked to symptom severity in the patients with BN, which is partly supported by previous findings. For example, several systematic reviews have indicated that illness severity of BN was associated with diminished activation in frontostriatal circuits (Donnelly et al.,  ; Frank,  ; Steward et al.,  ). Specifically, in our study, the PC1 component corresponded to emotion‐related symptoms and binge‐eating frequency, which reflects the symptom severity of BN and could distinguish BN patients from HCs. The FC‐behavioral regression analysis revealed a significant interaction effect between the PC1 component and the FC between the right mOFC and right putamen in the BN and HC groups, that is, the PC1 component was significantly negatively correlated with the FC values in the BN group but showed a positive correlation in the HC group. That is, the higher the FC value between the right mOFC and right putamen in the BN patients, the lower the symptom severity, and the closer the FC value of the BN patients was to the HC group, the milder the symptom severity. These findings support the notion that reward‐processing deficits are associated with symptom severity in BN. \n\nIn addition, our study also found increased FC between the right STG and right VTA in the BN group. The STG, an area where the temporal and parietal lobes meet and are responsible for face processing and social cognition, has been shown to be associated with BN. The STG, incorporating information from the limbic system and somatosensory systems, plays a key role in social perception. Some studies have revealed that the smaller volume of the STG in BN may cause abnormal body image perception and excessive focus on body weight and shape, leading to binge‐eating/purging behavior (Li et al.,  ; Solstrand Dahlberg et al.,  ). Another structural MRI study showed that the STG was associated with body dissatisfaction in Japanese individuals (Kohmura et al.,  ). The VTA of the midbrain, which is rich in dopaminergic neurons, is the key brain region of the mesocorticolimbic pathway and is involved in the pathophysiology of BN (Jiang et al.,  ). The increased FC between the right STG and right VTA may indicate the aberrant reward‐based body image processing underlying in the STG. \n\nSome limitations should be noted in this study. Our sample size was modest, and the results should be verified and extended with much larger samples. In addition, some patients in our study had mild anxiety or depressive symptoms that may have confounded our findings, but this may also make the sample more representative of the typical BN population (Godart et al.,  ). The cross‐sectional nature of our study means that further work is needed to clarify whether the observed cortical morphological abnormalities and related FC changes are the results of BN pathology or the consequence of binge‐eating and compensatory behaviors. \n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nOur findings suggest that increased sulcal depth in the right mOFC and STG was observed in BN patients compared to HCs, and FC changes in the regions may be related to aberrant reward processing and body image processing, which may contribute to the development and persistence of BN. We further found that the morphological abnormality in the right mOFC and reduced FC with the right putamen may play a contributory role in the psychopathology of BN. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT \n  \nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported. \n\n\n\n### PEER REVIEW \n  \nThe peer review history for this article is available at  . \n\n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"84fcc290da54dd7f6e99b85a725edb05"},

Here, we describe a unique, randomized, controlled trial to test the hypothesis that both movement and social engagement aspects of a group dance intervention alter the connectivity of key brain networks involved in motor and social-emotional functioning and lead to improved QoL in PWAD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nIMOVE (NCT03333837) was a single-center, randomized, controlled 2x2 factorial trial that assigned PWAD/caregiver dyads to one of 4 study conditions (Movement Group, Movement Alone, Social Group, or Usual Care control). The Movement Group participated in twice-weekly group improvisational dance (IMPROVment® Method) classes for 12 weeks. The Movement Alone intervention captured the same dance movement and auditory stimuli as the group class without social interaction, and the Social Group used improvisational party games to recapitulate the fun and playfulness of the Movement Group without the movement. The primary outcome was change in QoL among PWAD. Key secondary outcomes were functional brain network measures assessed using graph-theory analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans, as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms, gait, and balance. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 111 dyads were randomized; 89 completed the study, despite interruption and modification of the protocol due to COVID-19 restrictions (see companion paper by Fanning et al.).

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and accounts for an estimated 60%–80% of cases [ ]. In addition to memory loss, confusion, and difficulty completing familiar tasks, people with Alzheimer's disease (PWAD) and related dementias experience neuropsychiatric symptoms (i.e., apathy, depression, anxiety, agitation, aggression) [ ,  ,  ], altered gait, and poor balance [ ,  ,  ] that impair quality of life (QoL) [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ] and increase medical costs [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Caregivers (CGs) of people with dementia are twice as likely to report substantial emotional, financial and physical difficulties than CGs for older people with other needs [ ]. Notably, the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional disability in PWAD and related dementias is positively associated with burden and healthcare utilization among CGs [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nNeurodegeneration causes the changes in behavior and cognition associated with AD. Graph theory-based analysis of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) has shown that AD, even at very early stages [ ], induces changes in the organization and connectivity of functional brain networks (reviewed by Dennis and Thompson [ ]). Among older adults with MCI, reduced connectivity between the sensorimotor and frontoparietal networks was associated with slower gait [ ]. Healthy older adults also show decreased global efficiency and modularity in brain regions associated with mobility and cognition [ ,  ,  ]. Emerging evidence suggests that, similar to other movement and exercise interventions [ ,  ,  ,  ], dance may increase brain volumes [ , ], structural connectivity [ ], brain-derived neurotrophic factor [ ], and functional connectivity [ , ] in older adults. \n\nThere is mounting evidence that sensory and motor regions of the central nervous system are affected by the pathology of AD [ ,  ,  ]; thus, interventions that target and support the sensorimotor system may enhance patient function as AD progresses or slow the progression of disability. Dance incorporates movement, social engagement, and cognitive stimulation and thus, may help maintain quality of life for older adults, including PWAD. Although the evidence base for dance movement is compromised by heterogeneity in dance interventions and outcomes across studies, several recent meta-analyses of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that dance interventions improve cognition in older adults with MCI [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Fewer studies have assessed the impact of dance on neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms; however, a meta-analysis of 5 RCTs [ ] showed that dance interventions improved depressive symptoms in older adults with MCI and dementia. In a meta-analysis of 8 RCTs [ ], cognitive benefits of dance interventions in older adults with MCI were accompanied by significant improvements in physical function and QoL. Finally, Ghadiri et al. [ ] recently showed that a 10-week Iranian dance intervention improved gait parameters in older women with dementia. \n\nUnlike many other forms of dance, improvisational dance is not learned by repetition and reinforcement of specific steps. Improvisational dance utilizes verbal auditory cueing to convey ideas that elicit novel movement from class participants. Because the cues do not prescribe specific movements, improvisation allows movers to make empowering choices within a structured environment of select constraints [ , ]. Improvisational dance may or may not be rhythmically synchronized with music and is particularly well-suited for PWAD because it 1) does not rely heavily on memory; 2) can be seamlessly adapted to sitting, standing, or moving around the room; 3) is cognitively challenging; and 4) fosters a social, playful atmosphere. \n\nThe IMPROVment™ method ( ) is a group-based, improvisational dance intervention grounded in 4 principles: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. In a previous study, this method improved balance and mobility in people with Parkinson's disease, and markedly changed functional brain network architecture in the one participant scanned [ ]. Ongoing community classes as well as the largest support group for people with Parkinson's disease in Forsyth County, North Carolina, USA arose from this study, demonstrating the establishment of meaningful social connections among participants. Additionally, a pilot study evaluated the feasibility and potential benefits of IMPROVment classes (twice weekly for 8 weeks) versus usual care in people with MCI or early-stage dementia and their CGs [ ]. The intervention arm (n = 5 dyads) demonstrated 96% class attendance, and qualitative feedback suggested that participants felt socially connected to the group. QoL and balance were improved from baseline in the intervention arm, whereas worsening of both parameters was observed in usual care controls. Neuroimaging analyses revealed improvements in several brain network characteristics among participants in the intervention arm, but not in the usual care arm. These included global efficiency and modularity, two metrics that are reduced with age and pathology [ , , ]. \n\nResults of the pilot study described above informed the design of IMOVE, a study designed to test the hypothesis that both movement and social engagement alter the connectivity of key brain networks involved in motor and social-emotional functioning and lead to improved QoL in PWAD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Design and ethics \n  \nIMOVE (NCT03333837) is a single-center, randomized, controlled 2x2 factorial trial ( ) designed to test the separate and combined effects of social engagement and dance movement on QoL in PWAD [ ]. The factorial design follows current strategy developed for assessing effects of multi-component interventions. As our focus is on the individual effect of social engagement and dance, and their additive effect, the factorial design preserves power, which is a function of the overall sample size, not individual cell size. The protocol was reviewed and approved by Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM) Institutional Review Board. All PWAD and CGs provided their written informed consent to participate.   \nIntervention arms of the IMOVE trial testing separate and combined effects of movement and social engagement. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n### Recruitment \n  \nParticipant dyads (i.e., one PWAD and one CG) were recruited through the WFSM Kulynych Memory Assessment Clinic (MAC) and the WFSM Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) after their routine evaluation and diagnostic classification. The assessments in these two settings, described in more detail below, are highly overlapping and ensured consistency in adjudication of cognitive status. Participants could be referred from other clinics as long as the adjudication procedure was similar to that used in the MAC or ADRC and a cognitive battery, bloodwork, exam by a physician, and neuroimaging were performed. Additional participants recruited from the community followed similar procedures and were cognitively adjudicated through the ADRC. \n\n\n### Adjudication of cognitive status \n  \nCognitive evaluation included a neuropsychological test battery, functional status questionnaires completed by a proxy, and a history and physical by a board-certified geriatrician. In the MAC and ADRC, patients without recent imaging or blood work to rule out reversible causes of cognitive impairment received standard blood assays and an MRI (or CT scan if MRI was contraindicated). After reviewing all data and in consultation with the diagnostic team, dementia experts assigned a diagnosis of AD, other forms of dementia, MCI, or normal cognition using Alzheimer's Association/National Institute on Aging criteria [ ]. The cognitive test battery included tests of naming, word fluency, working and episodic verbal and visual memory, and global cognition. Depression and other psychiatric symptoms, functional independence, and CG assessment of cognitive and physical function were also assessed via interviews and questionnaires. Participants were required to have a Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score ≥15 to participate. \n\n\n### Eligibility \n  \n#### People with AD \n  \nParticipants were 60–85 year-old English speakers who were adjudicated as having MCI or early-stage dementia of the predominantly AD, vascular, or mixed AD/vascular type within 1 year of beginning the study. PWAD were required to have an eligible CG and be able to undergo MRI. PWAD were excluded from participation if they had other causes of dementia, such as Lewy body, frontotemporal, or Parkinsonian dementia; had any major medical problem that could reasonably affect cognitive or brain imaging measures used to determine eligibility or outcomes, or severely impact attendance (e.g., current cancer treatment); had other neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, or multiple sclerosis; were taking medication (e.g., benzodiazepines) that could negatively influence safety during intervention sessions; had current drug or alcohol use/dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements; had any reason for which the study doctor or personal physician felt that the intervention was contraindicated; had planned extensive travel during the study period; were enrolled in another interventional study within 3 months prior to beginning this study; or were unwilling to provide consent or assent for study participation. PWAD who had suffered a cortical stroke, had current stroke symptoms, or who had stroke deemed exclusionary by the study physician were excluded. PWAD with subcortical stroke that was resolved or asymptomatic could be included if found to be appropriate by the study physician. \n\n\n#### Caregivers \n  \nEligible CGs were individuals who spent ≥10 h per week with a PWAD and were willing to regularly accompany the PWAD to intervention sessions and actively participate. A CG was required to be present at each intervention session and study visit. In acknowledgement of the complex caregiving situations experienced by many families experiencing dementia, different CGs could accompany the PWAD to intervention sessions, e.g., if the primary caregiver had a conflict, a regular secondary caregiver could accompany the PWAD. CGs were excluded for unwillingness to provide consent for study participation; any major medical problem that could reasonably affect ability to attend study and intervention visits; taking medication that could negatively influence safety during the intervention sessions; current drug or alcohol use/dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements; or extensive travel planned during the study period without availability of an alternate CG. \n\n\n\n### Procedures \n  \n#### Randomization \n  \nAfter completion of baseline assessments, participants were randomized to one of 4 study conditions (Movement Group [MG], Movement Alone [MA], Social Group [SG], or Usual Care [UC]) through a computerized randomization scheme. Randomization codes were generated and maintained by the study statistician. Because recruitment occurred in waves, randomization was performed in blocks of 16 dyads (4 per arm) that each corresponded with a wave of data collection. We anticipated that sex-balance of PWAD participants would be achieved, as it was in the pilot, because although women are more likely to be diagnosed with dementia, they are also more likely to be CGs. However, if gender balance of PWAD was not achieved in any wave, gender blocking could be employed in the next wave. \n\n\n#### Blinding \n  \nStudy staff who administered testing during study visits were blinded to the randomization scheme. Therefore, group assignment was not known during screening, baseline, or follow-up assessments. One primary study staff member was unblinded after baseline visits for the purposes of notifying participants of their study arm, coordinating intervention visits as needed, and making reminder calls. All other study staff remained blinded to perform follow-up testing visits. Intervention staff were not blinded to study group assignments but did not perform any research assessments on participants. Participants were instructed not to mention their study group to staff performing assessments. The principal investigator and biostatistician were blinded until database lock. \n\n\n#### Non-imaging assessments \n  \nThe schedule of PWAD baseline and follow-up assessments is summarized in  , and assessments are described below The primary outcome, QoL in PWAD, was assessed using the Quality of Life AD (QOL-AD) [ , ], a 13-item scale designed to assess quality of life in people with dementia that is validated for use in people with a Mini Mental State Exam score as low as 10.   \nSchedule of PWAD procedures and assessments. \n  Table 1         \n\nSecondary outcomes focused on the two hypothesized global mechanisms of change: physical and emotional well-being. Physical function was assessed using: 1) the Expanded Short Physical Performance Battery (eSPPB) [ ], a global mobility assessment that includes brief assessments of gait speed, lower body strength and balance with a 4 m walk, a 4 m narrow walk, time to rise from a chair 5 times, and time to stand in different standing balance postures, including standing on one leg; 2) Timed Up and Go (TUG) [ ], which measures the time for a participant to rise from a chair, walk 3 m, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit; 3) Postural sway (or stability) was evaluated with center-of-Pressure (COP) trajectory data collected at 100 Hz using an Advanced Mechanical Technology Incorporated (AMTI) AccuSway biomechanics force platform for ten 30 s trials, five completed with a foam mat [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]; and 4) the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (FAB) [ ], which measures balance using 10 different performance-based tests. Mood was assessed using: 1) self-report by the PWAD on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale [ ], 2) Geriatric Anxiety Scale [ ], and 3) Apathy Evaluation Scale [ ]; and 4) through caregiver report of symptoms using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) [ ], a questionnaire where the CG rated the frequency, severity, and distress of symptoms in the PWAD across 12 domains. \n\nTertiary or exploratory outcomes included a test of divergent thinking, the Unusual Uses Task, to assess whether participating in weekly classes that encouraged creative thinking altered divergent thinking [ , ]; the Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale [ , ]; a brief test of multisensory reaction times [ ]; and a blood draw to assess biomarkers of stress (allostatic load) [ ]. To control for any potential relationships between study interventions and cognition, an abbreviated cognitive battery, the Repeatable Battery for Neuropsychological Status [ ] was administered at baseline and follow-up. Change in cognition was not a prespecified outcome as it was not expected to change with such a short duration of observation. Standard demographic and health variables collected for statistical adjustment, anticipated questions, or exploration of alternate hypotheses for PWAD included demographic characteristics, self-reported medical history, body-mass index, and blood pressure. \n\nAssessments of CGs were performed for the purpose of adjusting for certain variables if needed that might influence PWAD QoL. Caregiver assessments were similar to PWAD assessments and were administered as summarized in  . Measures administered to CGs that were not administered to PWAD included: 1) the NEO Five Factor Inventory [ ], because previous work suggests that CG personality may influence caregiver reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms and burden [ ] and 2) the Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale [ ], a 21-item self-report scale where caregivers rate items describing frequency of burdensome or stressful situations. CGs did not undergo MRI. \n\n\n#### Neuroimaging \n  \nPWAD completed 1-h MRI scans at baseline and follow-up. These included T1-weighted structural images, fMRI images, and images needed for potential alternate hypotheses (e.g., FLAIR images to assess white matter hyperintensity burden, related to slower gait speed in aging [ ]). All MRI images were acquired on a 3 T (3 T) Siemens Skyra scanner with a 32-channel headcoil. \n\n Acquisition.   A high resolution T1-weighted image was collected using a 3D volumetric MPRAGE-GRAPPA sequence (TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, TI = 900 ms, FOV = 256 mm, number of slices = 192, voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm, scan duration = 312 s). Whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) imaging was acquired during resting state, where participants are asked to view a cross in the middle of a screen with eyes open (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 25 ms, FOV = 256 mm number of images = 190, voxel size = 4.0 × 4.0 × 4.0 mm, scan duration = 380 s, acquired anterior-to-posterior) [ ]. A 14 s reverse-encoded BOLD scan was acquired for distortion correction using the same parameters, but acquired in the posterior-to-anterior direction. A T2-FLAIR SPACE image was acquired for the estimation of WMH (TR = 5000 ms, TE = 383 ms, FOV = 256 mm, number of slices = 192, voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm, scan duration = 417 s). \n\n Preprocessing.   High resolution T1-weighted anatomical were spatially normalized to the MNI template using ANTs [ ]. To ensure an accurate whole-brain mask prior to spatial normalization using ANTs, images were segmented using SPM12 ( ) and a whole-brain mask was created for each participant using both white and grey matter segments. Whole-brain mask images were manually inspected and cleaned to remove excess parenchymal tissue using MRIcron ( ) to create a final whole-brain mask. \n\nBOLD fMRI images were preprocessed using SPM, FSL, and warping parameters from ANTs implemented in an automated pipeline run through Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The first 10 vol were dropped to allow for signal stabilization and the ‘topup’ procedure in FSL was used for distortion correction. SPM12 was used to complete slice time correction and realignment of functional images. The transformation derived from ANTs was applied to warp BOLD images to MNI space. Motion scrubbing [ ] and a band-pass filter (0.009–0.08 Hz) to account for low-frequency drift and physiologic noise were applied. Finally, the data were adjusted for head motion and non-neural signal using 6 rigid-body motion parameters generated during realignment and average signal from white matter and CSF. \n\n Brain Network Generation.   The preprocessed fMRI data were used to create a network, or graph, for each individual using all the voxels within the grey matter segmentation mask [ ]. Nodes in the graph were defined as individual voxels. The presence of a connection (edge) between two nodes (i and j) was determined by 1) completing a voxelwise time series regression analysis to generate a whole-brain functional connectivity matrix for all node pairs; 2) thresholding the correlation matrix to create a binarized adjacency matrix (A ) where a value of 1 indicated the presence of an edge and a value of 0 indicated no edge. In order to ensure comparable edge density across participants, a sparsity threshold was calculated using (S = log (N)/log (K)), where   N   is the number of nodes and   K   is the average degree (i.e., number of edges per node in the network). Only positive edges were retained in the final matrix. Functional network variables of interest are described in section  . \n\n Regions of interest (ROIs).   Regional changes in whole brain metrics and community analyses were performed on two   a priori   ROIs: the somatomotor cortex (SMC) and default mode network (DMN). The SMC is involved in motor planning and execution and the DMN has been implicated in mood disorders [ ] and AD [ ]. ROIs were generated using resting-state brain networks from independent data in 22 normal young adults from a prior study [ ]. \n\nNeuroimaging outcomes included functional brain network measures assessed with graph-theory analysis [ ] of resting-state fMRI scans ( ). Path length is the number of edges that must be crossed to get from one node to another. Longer path length in people with AD has been associated with slower cognitive performance, beta amyloid deposition, and depression [ ,  ,  ]. Global Efficiency (E ) reflects the efficiency with which information from one node can move through the network [ ]. Decreased E  has been associated with aging, cognitive impairment, and depression [ , ]. Local Efficiency (E ) is related to clustering, and reflects the efficiency with which information from one node is propagated to its neighbors [ ] and has been reported to change with cognitive impairment and depression [ ]. We computed modularity (Q) [ , ], to assess community structure strength in the brain networks using the “Louvain” algorithm [ ]. Our work has demonstrated decreased modularity associated with decreased physical function [ ], and others have shown that cognitive impairment and AD are associated with alterations in modularity [ , ]. Consistency of community structure across individuals was measured within ROIs using Scaled Inclusivity (SI) [ ]. SI values range from 0 to 1 where high SI indicates that a particular network community is consistently observed within the group [ ]. Reduced consistency of SMC community structure has been observed in older adults with poor mobility function compared with young adults [ ].   \nSecondary outcomes. \n  Table 2     \n\n\n\n### Interventions \n  \n#### Class themes and structure \n  \nProtocolization of the study interventions will be more fully described in a forthcoming publication by Soriano et al. Six themes were created to distinguish teaching methodologies and to provide structure for the 12-week intervention. Each theme was explored for 2 weeks (4 classes), with each class and theme gaining in complexity as the 2 weeks progressed. The themes were loosely inspired by Rudolph Laban's Movement Analysis system which was developed to describe human movement [ ], and included: isolation, which we defined as moving one or more body parts independently; shape, which focused on creating shapes or images with the body; time, which had to do with the amount of time that one takes to complete a movement or the rhythm used or a particular relationship with a piece of music; flow, which we defined as ongoingness; space/direction which was about connecting the body to the space around it and the pathways one takes through space; and effort, which was the quality with which a dancer moves their body. Once the exercises were organized into themes, an exercise order was created, and classes could be taught by any trained IMPROVment instructor. \n\nImprovisation was the element that spanned all 3 intervention arms of the study. Thus, the same 6 themes were a guiding force in development of the SG arm. Common party games such as Hangman, Boggle, and Pictionary were modified to adhere to these themes and to include improvisation as described in a forthcoming publication by Soriano et al. Games were also modified to reduce individual competitiveness, to be easy and fun to learn, and to work in a group environment. \n\nGroup interventions were initiated in waves as described in section  . All three intervention arms (MG, MA, SG) met for 1-h sessions twice weekly for 12 weeks (for a total of 24 sessions). Participants had the option to complete the 24 sessions within 13 weeks to allow make-up days for missed classes. Attendance was documented at each session. \n\nAll interventions took place in spaces that were safe, well-lit, had convenient parking, and were accessible for a range of mobility and included a local dance studio, two different churches, and a community center. For dance interventions, spaces were free from obstacles, had a sturdy chair with no arms available to each PWAD, and were equipped with a means for playing music or recordings of dance instructors. The primary dance PI (Soriano) or an instructor trained by her conducted all group interventions, both movement and social, to control for factors related to instructor personality across study arms. \n\n\n#### Movement Group (MG) \n  \nThe IMPROVment method and theory were described previously [ , ]. Briefly, this improvisational dance method is grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. Active imagination, variability, and pacing are integral components of the method. The instructor provides verbal cues that activate the imagination (e.g., moving in a windstorm, arriving at the beach) and may demonstrate an optional response, but asks participants to respond with their own gestural inventions. Variability is accomplished by presenting new prompts or adding complexity to a specific exercise. Some cues require dual- or multi-tasking (e.g., direct traffic with the right side of the body and pick apples with the left). Cues are often delivered one after another, preventing participants from defaulting to habitual responses or being limited by self-perceptions of their capabilities. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem presented. There is little time to change one's mind, become embarrassed, or be dissatisfied with the choice made. Thus, the method builds on the idea that daily living requires flexible, adaptive responses to real-life challenges. \n\nClasses were structured in 4 phases: (1) group warm-up in chairs positioned in a circle, (2) standing barre or back of the chair with solo and responsive exercises, (3) moving as a group through free space (with and without a partner), and (4) recuperation and rest. All exercises could be adapted for sitting, and the choice to stand or walk was always determined by the participant. Similar exercises could appear within each phase (seated/standing/walking), creating a progression of motor skills, but the class series did not build incrementally. The recuperation phase involved movements that were slower, simpler, and often more familiar (e.g., seated hamstring stretch). To track fidelity to the protocol, instructors noted any exercises that were missed at the conclusion of each intervention. \n\n\n#### Movement Alone (MA) \n  \nThe MA intervention was designed to capture the same dance movement and auditory stimuli as the group class without social interaction. Recordings of the dance instructors, including the same range of prompts presented to group classes, were played. This ensured participants heard comparable music and received comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that those in the MG arm heard, but without interacting with other people. Participants were asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the MG arm and completed two 1-h dance sessions each week. The MA intervention took place at the same locations as the MG and SG study arms. MA participants were met at the site by study staff, who checked them in, organized the music and recordings, and were present outside the room while the participant danced for safety. A sample of each participant's individual dances session was video recorded for the purpose of confirming movement fidelity versus the MG intervention. \n\n\n#### Social Group (SG) \n  \nIn the pilot study, the individual item on the QOL-AD that increased most in PWAD who participated in the MG intervention was ‘Ability to do things for fun’. Therefore, the SG intervention consisted of improvisational party games to foster curiosity and playfulness, use imagery, and encourage non-judgment. Games included ‘Balderdash’, ‘Wise and Otherwise’, ‘Pictionary’, and ‘Tell Me A Story’ cards. As mentioned above, the games were organized around the same themes as the movement exercises and were designed to follow the same core components as the MG (active imagination, pacing, variability, and non-judgement, non-competitiveness, curiosity, playfulness). Multiple games were played within each session to incorporate pacing and variability. \n\n\n#### Usual care (UC) \n  \nThe UC control arm captured the condition of no added social contact and no added dance movement. Participants randomized to the UC arm were asked to continue their current disease management and lifestyle for 12 weeks. Participants were called monthly and reminded by phone to maintain their usual lifestyle. Because the condition of not receiving an intervention can have ethical implications and reduce retention rates, UC participants were invited to join a weekly community improvisational dance class after they completed the study or to join MG classes if space allowed. \n\n\n\n### Monitoring of health status \n  \nAll participants were required to notify study staff of any major changes in their lifestyle or health status that might affect study outcomes or their safety during participation. In addition, changes in health status, medications, or lifestyle were solicited by study staff via phone once monthly. Participants were specifically asked about falls. Solicited and unsolicited reports of health events were documented. A participant was asked to discontinue the intervention if they had any change in health status that met exclusion criteria or if the intervention or testing was judged by study staff, the participant, study physician, or personal physician to put the participant at risk. \n\n\n### Handling of adverse events \n  \nAn adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during participation in the clinical study, regardless of relationship to participation. Anticipated adverse events in the MG and MA arms included falling, tripping, and muscle soreness. If a participant fell during the intervention 2 or more times during the 12-week period, the option to stand or walk would be removed, and they would be asked to remain seated for the remainder of the sessions. However, no participants fell during intervention. If participants tripped, the instructions were modified as necessary to prevent further tripping. Movement intensity could be reduced if needed to prevent further muscle soreness in affected participants. Study safety was reviewed at least monthly and adverse events were reported biannually to the Data Safety and Monitoring Board. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \n#### General design issues \n  \nThe study uses a full-factorial design to test the main effects of movement and social engagement and their possible synergistic effect. Suppose   represents the primary outcome of interest post-intervention, and   the outcome at baseline. The following ANOVA model forms the basis of the power calculations and subsequent analyses: where   X represents   the movement component, μ represents the mean, Z represents the social component, and (  XZ  ) represents the interaction between X and Z, and   represents random error, with,   i  ,   j   = 1,2, and   k   = 1,.,n, where n is the sample size. Equation   decomposes the response (QoL-AD) into the sum of effect of the variables and controls for value pre-intervention. \n\n\n#### Data analysis \n  \n Analysis of Aim 1: Determine the independent effects of social engagement and dance movement on QoL in people with dementia by assessing the main effects of social engagement and movement.   We will use analysis of variance (Equation  ) to assess the main effects of social engagement and movement on QoL. Effect coding for the   X  ,  Y   variables will be used so that the coefficients   β   and   β   in Equation   can be directly tested and interpreted respectively as half the main effects of the movement and the social components. The null hypothesis is that there will be no main effect. Statistically, we will test the following two hypotheses:   H  :   β  1 = 0;   β  2 = 0 at the level of   α   = 0.05. Following common practice, we will not adjust for covariates in testing main effects unless severe imbalances occurs in cell distributions of demographic variables including gender and age. The synergistic effects of the movement and social engagement will be evaluated by testing the hypothesis: H :   β   = 0. \n\n Analysis of Aim 2: Assess potential mechanistic links between functional neuroimaging metrics, behavioral outcomes, and overall QoL scores using structural equation modeling in all groups combined.   Longitudinal structural equation modeling (SEM) will be used to assess Aim 2 using the path diagram in   (note that   represents a cross-sectional “slice” of the overall longitudinal model of 3 time points). With the Markov assumption such that a measure at a previous time point has a direct effect on the same measure at current time point, we will analyze the data such that QoL will be the observed outcome variable. Movement is hypothesized to exert effects on QoL through changes in somatomotor brain networks, a latent variable comprised of multiple graph theory-derived measures of connectivity in the somatomotor ROI defined in section  , including E , E , and modularity. Changes in somatomotor network structure are hypothesized to result in improved gait (a latent variable comprised of gait speed, gait variability, and stride length derived from the instrumented mat) and balance (a latent variable including balance measured with the FAB, balance confidence measured with the Falls Efficacy International Scale, and postural sway measured with the force plate). Social engagement was hypothesized to alter connectivity in the default mode network, modeled using multiple graph theory-derived measures of connectivity in the DMN ROI, including E , E , path length, and degree. Altered DMN connectivity was hypothesized to result in decreased neuropsychiatric symptoms and increased QoL. SEM analysis [ ] will proceed in several stages. First, confirmatory factor analytic models will be fitted to the stated indicators for individual latent variables. We will examine goodness-of-fit indexes to determine the appropriate measurement models and refine the measures if necessary. Second, we will assess the consistency between the structural model and the data. Structural connections that are not significant will be deleted and will be reported, and alternative hypotheses will be tested. This iterative process will result in a final structural model that offers insight into the mechanism through which improvisational dancing affects overall well-being in the population of PWAD. SEM analysis will be conducted using Mplus v7.4.   \n Path diagram for proposed SEM analysis.   Grey shaded squares represent components of the intervention hypothesized to be generating an effect.

Although the pilot did not test separate effects of social engagement and dance movement and was an 8-week rather than a 12-week intervention, the pilot data suggested the amount of change we could expect. For power calculations, we used a conservative estimate of effect size of 0.55 per main effect. The power of the study using a sample size of 30 per cell in the 2x2 factorial design (total N = 120) is approximately 85%. If due to attrition the sample size dropped to N = 100, then power would be reduced to 78%. The power analysis assumed a 2-sided test at α = 0.05, and the calculation was conducted using the SAS macro FactorialPowerPlan [ ]. We collected follow-up data on all participants to the best of our ability for the purpose of completing an intent-to-treat analysis. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nParticipant flow is summarized in  . Of 1194 dyads telephone screened, 101 were randomized. A total of 54 dyads had completed study interventions when in-person interventions ceased due to COVID-19 restrictions (March 2020). Interventions were suspended until the protocols for the MG, MA, and SG groups could be modified for virtual delivery. We adopted an engineering-inspired, rapid refinement model to identify and rectify weak points in our remote intervention protocols until participants in each arm consistently reported high levels of engagement, social connection, and enjoyment. This iterative approach is described in a companion article to this publication (Fanning et al.). Interventions resumed virtually in November 2020. Of the 101 dyads enrolled, 89 completed their assigned interventions. Study data are being analyzed and results will be submitted for publication in 2023.   \n IMOVE participant flow from enrollment to analysis.   *Participants could meet more than one exclusion criterion. CG = caregiver; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; PWAD = people with Alzheimer's disease. \n  Fig. 3   \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe multimodal and integrated nature of dance does not easily conform to the constraints of traditional RCT design (e.g., blinding of researchers/participants, isolating variables, limiting cross-factorial influences). Studies capable of capturing the complexity of interpersonal interactions while determining physiological mechanisms and respecting the integrity of the dance form under investigation are challenging to design and execute. The IMOVE study is the product of a unique, highly innovative, and productive partnership [ , ] that combines expertise in dance and neuroscience. To our knowledge, there is no published mechanistic model to explain the effects of dance on QoL or secondary symptoms in PWAD. Furthermore, our 2x2 factorial design is the first to evaluate the independent and combined contributions of 2 key aspects of an arts-based intervention. \n\nWe hypothesize that both movement and social engagement alter the connectivity of key brain networks involved in motor and social-emotional functioning, and lead to improved QoL in PWAD. A better understanding of the physiological changes that occur during dance, and their links to improved QoL and symptom management, could facilitate identification of other interventions that may ameliorate secondary symptoms of AD. Such a model may also help to identify other patient populations that may benefit from dance or other art forms. \n\nSeveral caveats and limitations of our work warrant mention. Inclusion criteria were based on cognitive adjudication by consensus through our ADRC. However, the time and financial constraints of the granting mechanism precluded biomarker assessment of AD status. The APOE allele is associated with increased risk for late-onset AD, and PWAD who have the APOE4 genotype may respond differently to physical activity interventions. Genotyping of PWAD was not performed due to budget limitations, but samples were collected and stored for potential future analyses. Second, because the study population was limited to patients with early AD and their CGs, the value of the intervention in patients with later-stage disease cannot be assumed based on our results. Third, the study was designed to evaluate the potential impact of a 12-week intervention in PWAD, and the duration of impact beyond completion was not assessed. Finally, the breadth of assessments employed reflects the fact that dance outcomes are different from aging outcomes and are not well-established. The assessment requirements were somewhat burdensome for PWAD, CGs, and study staff. As the secondary outcomes were set up for exploratory analysis for potential mechanistic pathways, they were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The results of this study, when published, will strengthen the literature with respect to identification of endpoints that are sensitive to dance interventions and inform future designs. \n\nOverall, this manuscript reports on an innovative trial design that uses current strategies for testing multicomponent interventions to study dance as an art form and lifestyle choice that may have specific benefits for brain and body health during aging. The scientific study of the health effects of participating in dance and other art forms is growing rapidly. This study design contributes to gaps in the literature on dance by applying a method of study design that helps move forward understanding of the core components of dance that could contribute to brain and body health. There is a clear need for larger studies that target health outcomes and use scientific design choices to help elucidate the ‘medicine of dance’ to help move this vibrant and rapidly growing field forward. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nWe would like to gratefully acknowledge support from the  , specifically the   R01AT009444; the   through the   (P30AG072947) and   (P30AG021332); and the   through the   (UL1TR001420); and from the  . \n\n\n## Authors’ contributions \n  \nChristina E.

Low-frequency (e.g., 1 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting language processing regions (e.g., left TPJ) has been evident as a potential treatment for AVH. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of the rTMS treatment effect remain unclear.

The active treatment group receive 15-day 1 Hz rTMS stimulation to the left TPJ, whereas the placebo group received sham rTMS stimulation to the same site.

The seed-based (left TPJ) static and DFC was used to assess the connectivity characteristics during rTMS treatment in patients with AVH. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nOverall, symptom improvement following 1 Hz rTMS treatment was found in the active treatment group, whereas no change occurred in the placebo group. Moreover, decreased static FC (SFC) of the left TPJ with the right temporal lobes, as well as increased SFC with the prefrontal cortex and subcortical structure were observed in active rTMS group. Increased dynamic FC (DFC) of the left TPJ with frontoparietal areas was also found in the active rTMS group. However, seed-based SFC and DFC were reduced to a great extent in the placebo group. In addition, these changed FC (SFC) strengths in the active rTMS group were associated with reduced severity of clinical outcomes (e.g., positive symptoms). \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe application of 1 Hz rTMS over the left TPJ may affect connectivity characteristics of the targeted region and contribute to clinical improvement, which shed light on the therapeutic effect of rTMS on schizophrenia with AVH. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nAuditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are the most characteristic symptom of schizophrenia ( ) and are defined as the conviction of hearing and perceiving “sound” without corresponding external stimulus input ( ). Despite years of research, the neural mechanism of AVH continues to be unclear. Recently, neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the underlying functional and structural abnormalities associated with AVH in distributed brain regions, including Broca’s area, insula, hippocampal, and subcortical regions ( – ), which involved in speech processing, attention, and memory. The most consistent report is that the speech-processing regions of the superior temporal cortex are abnormal in terms of functional ( ,  ) and anatomical ( ,  ) alterations in schizophrenia with AVH. \n\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applies a repetitive pulsed magnetic field to the scalp, inducing an electric field in a discrete region of the brain ( ), and thus alters the neuronal activity underneath the stimulate target ( ). rTMS in low-frequency mode is thought to result in cortical inhibition ( ). Low-frequency rTMS has been evident as a treatment for AVH. In the first study, Hoffman and colleagues indicated a reduction in AVH after 1-Hz rTMS targeting the superior temporal gyrus in schizophrenia patients compared to sham stimulation ( ). Subsequently, numerous studies have replicated the preliminary finding ( – ). Meta-analysis studies have demonstrated a medium to a large effect size of low-frequency rTMS on AVH ( – ), although negative findings were reported ( ,  ). The evidence supports the potential of low-frequency rTMS for the reduction of AVH. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of symptom improvement following rTMS treatment need further clarification. \n\nSchizophrenia has been considered a dysconnectivity syndrome ( ). And abnormal functional connectivity (FC) patterns between the distributed brain areas have been found in schizophrenia patients with AVH ( – ) and have been associated with the clinical severity of AVH ( ). Interestingly, several studies have reported the effects of low-frequency rTMS on brain activity and connectivity in schizophrenia with AVH. In a small sample study, increased task-related activity in brain areas that involved in speech processing was observed in patients with AVH after 1 Hz rTMS treatment ( ). Low-frequency rTMS mode also reduced brain metabolism in the left superior temporary gyrus and interconnected region, as well as enhanced metabolism in the contralateral cortex and the frontal lobes in schizophrenia patients with AVH ( ). \n\nUsing the left temporoparietal junction area (TPJ) as seed, Vercammen and colleagues have found an increased FC between the seed and right insula in patients receiving 1 Hz rTMS applied to the left TPJ, while the sham stimulation group showed a decreased FC between the seed and left anterior cingulate ( ). Recently, our study has demonstrated that low-frequency rTMS treatment in schizophrenia patients with AVH can induce the global and local topological properties changes of the whole brain functional network and were associated with the reduction of AVH ( ). The results suggest that the application of low-frequency rTMS targeting the left TPJ may affect neural activity and connectivity in the targeted site and associated remote regions. \n\nThe purpose of present study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of 1 Hz rTMS treatment on schizophrenia with AVH using seed-based FC analysis. Using the left TPJ as seed, on the one hand, we replicated the results from the previous study ( ) by using the static functional connectivity (SFC) analysis; on the other hand, provided   by using seed-based dynamic functional connective (DFC) approach. We speculated that 1 Hz rTMS would induce beneficial static or dynamic FC (DFC) changes of left TPJ seed in patients with AVH after treatment and could be related to the improvement of clinical symptoms. \n\n\n## 2. Material and methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nFifty-eight patients were recruited in the study. Randomization of patients was performed outside the study group by simple random number generated from computer. Patients were allocated to one of the treatment conditions: rTMS stimulation to the left TPJ region (  n   = 32) or sham stimulation to the same site (  n   = 26).   shows the CONSORT flowchart with study enrollment, visits, and attrition. The diagnosis was confirmed by experienced psychiatrists according to the criteria of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-V). The inclusion criteria for the patients met the follows: (1) AVH daily occurred with no less than two antipsychotic medications, and (2) at least five episodes of AVH per day during the past month. All patients received a stable dose of antipsychotic medications throughout the study period. All groups were matched on age, gender, education, and duration of illness. Exclusion criteria for all patients included the follows: (1) previous or current neurological disease, (2) history of head injury, (3) alcohol or drug abuse, and (4) contraindications to MRI scans. \n\nInformed consent was obtained from all participants. The investigation was carried out by the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Medical Ethnic Committee of Xijing Hospital. This study was registered in China Clinical Trials (registration number: ChiCTR2100041876). \n\n\n### 2.2. Clinical measurements \n  \nThe psychotic symptoms were evaluated by the positive and negative symptom scale (PANSS) ( ), and the severity of AVH was assessed by the auditory hallucination rating scale (AHRS) ( ). All clinical measures were executed by experienced psychiatrists at pretreatment and posttreatment for all patients. \n\n\n### 2.3. rTMS procedure \n  \nUnlike our previous studies using case-control paradigm ( ,  – ), this study had a single-blind parallel design, only the rTMS administrator rather than researchers or raters knew the conditions to which patients were assigned. Stimulation was performed by a Magstim Rapid System (YIRUDE, Wuhan, China), using a 70 mm figure-of-eight coil. The stimulation site was determined based on the 10–20 international electrode location system (T3/P3). Active rTMS stimulation was carried out at 110% of the individual resting motor threshold (MT). The placebo condition was stimulated with a Magstim sham coil at the same location, which produced a similar sound stimulus, but no magnetic field through the skull. Each patient received a total of 15 rTMS sessions, each lasting 15 min, for a total of 9,000 pluses, over the course of 15 consecutive days. \n\n\n### 2.4. Neuroimaging data acquisition and processing \n  \nImages were acquired on a 3.0-Tesla scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) with a standard 8-channel phased-array head coil. The images were scanned twice in patients (baseline and after treatment). Participants were instructed to stay awake and kept their eyes closed during the scanning duration. Functional images were collected using a gradient-echo-planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: repetitive time (RT) = 2,000 ms, echo time (ET) = 40 ms, matrix = 64 × 64, field of view (FOV) = 260 × 260 mm , flip angle = 90°, 45 slices, with 3.5 mm slice thickness and no gap. A total of 210 whole brain volumes were acquired. An anatomical image was also obtained using an MP-RAGE sequence with the following parameters: TR = 8.1 ms, TE = 3.2 ms, matrix size = 256 × 256, flip angle = 12°, FOV = 240 × 240 mm , 176 slices, and with 1.0 mm thickness (no gap). \n\nData were processed in Matlab 2018b platform (MathWorks, Natick, MA) using the DPABI toolbox.  For each subject, the first 10 functional images were discarded and were then corrected for differences in slice timing and head motion. The corrected images were coregistered to the T1-weighted anatomical image. The coregistered anatomical images were segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. The following images were normalized into standardized Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space by the DARTEL algorithm and smoothed with a 6 mm Gaussian kernel. Subsequently, linear detrending and temporal filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz) were executed. Finally, nuisance covariates, including head motion, white matter signal, cerebrospinal fluid signal, and global mean signal, were regressed out. \n\n\n### 2.5. Static functional connectivity analysis \n  \nBased on the previous study ( ), the left TPJ seed was defined as a 10 mm radius sphere surrounding a central voxel ( ). Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis (REST) toolkit ( ) was used to calculate the seed-based resting-state SFC. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the time courses of the seed and the time series of each voxel of the whole brain were calculated. Correlation coefficients were transformed into Z-map with Fisher’s transformations to improve the normality of the data. \n  \nGraphical representation of the prior defined region of interest (left temporoparietal junction area) was defined using the Marsbar toolbox (MNI: −50.7, −41.4, 22.7). \n  \n\n### 2.6. Dynamic functional connectivity analysis \n  \nThe DFC was computed by using a sliding window approach through the DynamicBC toolbox ( ). DFC calculates the correlation of time series according to a certain length of the sliding window. Based on the previous literature ( ,  ), the length of the sliding window was set a 50 TRs, and the window overlap was set at 90%, resulting 31 windows for each participant. The temporal correlation coefficient between the time course of seed and time series all brain voxels within each sliding window was calculated and represented the DFC changes occurring entire scan course. Unlike the classic DFC studies that applied the k-means clustering algorithm to measure the frequency and structure of reoccurring FC patterns based on windowed covariance matrices between the predefined regions of interest (ROIs) or independent components (ICs) ( ,  ), the variance of each voxel across all windows on seed-based DFC denoted the temporal variability in the strength of connectivity. Higher DFC variability indicated greater fluctuations of FC strength over time. Referring to the previous study ( ,  ), the   Z  -valued FC variance maps were used in statistical analyses. To verity the results of DFC, the window size was changed with 40 TRs (overlap 90%) reanalyzed DFC for all participants. \n\n\n### 2.7. Statistical analysis \n  \nIndependent-sample   t  -test and chi-square test were used to test the clinical characteristic differences between the active treatment group and placebo group according to the nature of the data. In addition, a paired-sample   t  -test was used to test the changes in symptoms and FC between the patients before and after treatment. All results were controlled with age, sex, and head motion as covariates and were reported applied the Gaussian random field (GRF) correction with a voxel-level threshold of   p   < 0.05 and a cluster-level threshold of   p   < 0.05, the minus cluster size was set 30. \n\n\n### 2.8. Correlation analysis \n  \nTo investigate the associations between altered FC values and clinical responses, the mean values of altered SFC and DFC were extracted and then correlated with the scores of clinical responses with Pearson correlation analysis. A two-tailed p-level of 0.05 was considered as the criterion of statistical significance and corrected for multiple comparisons with the false discovery rate correction (FDR) method. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Patient characteristics \n  \nDue to excessive head movement (head motion parameters are greater than 3.0 mm and 3.0 degrees), data from three patients had to be excluded, leaving 30 patients in the active treatment group and 25 patients in the placebo group. There were no statistical significances between the two group in demographical variables, including age (  t   = 0.644,   p   = 0.478), sex (χ  = 0.045,   p   = 0.832), and education (  t   = 0.458,   p   = 0.756), and clinical measures, including illness duration (  t   = 0.525,   p   = 0.602), medication dosage (  t   = 0.218,   p   = 0.828), positive symptom (  t   = 0.983,   p   = 0.330), negative symptom (  t   = 0.178,   p   = 0.860), general symptom (  t   = 0.537,   p   = 0.593), and AVH (  t   = 0.689,   p   = 0.494). Details are displayed in  . \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the two patient groups receiving either rTMS or placebo treatment. \n    \n\n### 3.2. Treatment effect of rTMS \n  \nChanges in clinical symptoms over time were assessed separately for two groups. Pretreatment and posttreatment measures showed significant decreases in positive symptom (  t   = 6.197,   p   = 0.000), general symptom (  t   = 2.661,   p   = 0.011), and AVH (  t   = 6.542,   p   = 0.000) scores in the active treatment group ( ). But the clinical measures showed no change at all in the placebo group over time (all   p   > 0.05) ( ). \n  \nClinical symptom responses between before and after treatment in the active treatment group   (A)   and placebo group   (B)  . *  p   < 0.05, ***  p   < 0.001. ns, non-significance. \n  \n\n### 3.3. Static functional connectivity analysis of left TPJ seed \n  \nFor SFC analysis, the active treatment group showed significant FC changes in the left TPJ seed over the course of the treatment (  and  ). Specifically, the patients in the active treatment group had increased FC with the right superior frontal gyrus, right supplementary motor, and bilateral putamen, as well as decreased FC with the right inferior temporal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus ( ). \n  \nSeed-based static functional connectivity group comparisons. \n    \nSignificantly changes in static functional connectivity (SFC) of the left TPJ seed between before and after treatment in the two groups.   (A)   Significantly changes in SFC of the left TPJ seed in the active treatment group (posttreatment vs. pretreatment).   (B)   Significantly changes in SFC of the left TPJ seed in the placebo group (posttreatment vs. pretreatment). The warm color represents higher connectivity, and the cool color represents lower connectivity (GRF correction,   p   < 0.05, size > 30). TPJ, left temporoparietal junction; GRF, Gaussian random field. \n  \nThe placebo group on the other hand showed increased FC of the left TPJ with the left parietal cortex (e.g., angular and precuneus), as well as decreased FC of the left TPJ with left middle cingulate gyrus and bilateral insula ( ). \n\n\n### 3.4. Dynamics functional connectivity analysis of left TPJ seed \n  \nFor DFC analysis, there was a significantly increased DFC between the seed and left inferior frontal gyrus and right inferior parietal lobule in the active treatment group after treatment (  and  ). But decreased DFC of the seed with the right inferior occipital gyrus, right anterior cingulate gyrus, and right superior parietal lobule was observed in the placebo group (  and  ). \n  \nSeed-based dynamic functional connectivity group comparison. \n    \nSignificantly changes in dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) of the left TPJ seed between before and after treatment in the two groups.   (A)   Significantly changes in DFC of the left TPJ seed in the active treatment group (posttreatment vs. pretreatment).   (B)   Significantly changes in DFC of the left TPJ seed in the placebo group (posttreatment vs. pretreatment).

Discussion \n  \nThis study investigated the effects of l Hz rTMS on static and DFC in schizophrenia patients with AVH using the stimulation target (left TPJ) as seed. The results showed that active rTMS treatment could reduce the severity of clinical symptoms, whereas the placebo group appeared no symptom changes over the course of treatment. The results regarding alterations in clinical symptoms were fully consistent with the previous report ( ). The results also agree with the meta-analysis studies ( ,  ,  ) and confirmed the effectiveness of low-frequency rTMS treatment on AVH in schizophrenia with our previous studies ( ,  – ). Moreover, rTMS treatment induced beneficial connectivity changes of the seed in the active treatment group, including increased static FC (SFC) with prefrontal regions (e.g., right superior frontal gyrus and right supplementary motor cortex) and decreased SFC with the temporal lobe (e.g., right inferior temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus). In addition, increased DFC in the prefrontal (e.g., inferior frontal gyrus) and parietal (e.g., inferior parietal lobule) cortices was also observed in the active treatment group. But the placebo group showed a large proportion of reduced SFC or DFC of the seed after sham stimulation. In addition, these changed FC properties in the active treatment group were associated with a reduction in the severity of clinical symptoms (e.g., positive symptoms). These results were partially consistent with the previous study ( ). Clinical characteristics and sample size of patients may be the main reasons for the differences in results. Our findings provided   and suggested that induced broader FC changes relevant to the TPJ target site in schizophrenia patients could be the underlying neural mechanism of low-frequency rTMS treatment on AVH. \n\nAVH may arise from a mismatch of inner speech and its attribution ( ). The mismatch can be considered as a deficit in inner speech production or its perception and understanding ( ). Functional imaging studies have explored the neural correlates of AVH and have suggested that experiencing AVH is primarily involved the language-related network associated with the Broca area, the anterior insula, the inferior frontal gyrus, the middle temporal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus ( ,  ). Although structural and functional neuroimaging evidence has suggested that schizophrenia is associated with reduced left-hemisphere language lateralization ( – ), the right hemisphere is apparently involved in the meditation of left hemisphere language function ( – ), since the disturbance in the interaction of hemispheres appears in schizophrenia ( ). Previous studies have suggested that the inferior temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus are involved in language and semantic processing. Thus, the right inferior temporal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus as left hemisphere homologs may play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. AVH was associated with elevated metabolic activity and cortical involvement in the two regions ( ,  ), which supports the hypothesis that AVH arises from the misinterpretation of inner speech and the aberrant activation of the langue-related areas. \n\nThere is evidence that schizophrenia is linked to dysfunction in distributed neural circuits ( ,  ). rTMS has the potential to produce a distal effect that induces connection changes in remote brain regions beyond the stimulation site ( ,  ) through long-term potentiation and long-term depression-like mechanisms ( ). Studies have demonstrated that decreased metabolism in the auditor cortex, Broca area, and cingulate gyrus after TMS treatment relative to sham ( ), which implies that the clinical effect of rTMS may come from a normalization of the hyperactivity of language regions involved in the emergence of AVH. In line with these findings, we found that low-frequency rTMS decreased the SFC of seed with the right temporal lobes (e.g., right inferior temporal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus) in the active group and may suggest that the low-frequency TMS could have inhibitory effect on hyperconnectivity between the seed and language related areas, since rTMS in a low-frequency mode produce a reduction in cortical excitability of underlying brain tissue ( ,  ). The previous studies suggest that rTMS might induce local changes at the stimulate site and adjacent remote areas ( ,  ). Left TPJ as a critical stimulation target implicated in AVH generation and perception ( ,  ). Then, decreased connectivity of the stimulate site with contralateral temporal lobes may decrease the likelihood of inner speech intrusions. \n\nIn contrast, increased SFC of the left TPJ seed with the brain areas, including the right superior frontal gyrus, right supplementary motor cortex, and bilateral putamen was observed in the active treatment group after rTMS stimulation. The low-frequency rTMS-induced strong connectivity with these areas might be explained by the release of transcallosal inhibition ( ). For instance, enhanced activation is detected in the right hemisphere after left hemisphere injury ( ). As we know, the superior frontal gyrus is located at the superior part of the prefrontal cortex and has been reported to be involved in a wide variety of cognitive and attention tasks ( ,  ), which is a critical node of the cognitive control network ( ). This cortex is associated with decreased cognitive control ( ,  ) and decreased connectivity with other brain regions in schizophrenia patients ( ,  ). The supplementary motor cortex participates in the preparation and execution of movements ( ,  ), while the activation of this region is reduced during a motor task in schizophrenia patients ( ) and may reflect the motor dysfunction in schizophrenia ( ,  ), since motor symptom is one of clinical presentation of schizophrenia and frequently occur throughout the course of this disease ( ,  ). In addition, the putamen is a subcortical structure that forms the basal ganglia and is involved in the regulation of perception and motor controls ( ,  ). Degree centrality is decreased in the putamen in patients with AVH ( ) and reflects abnormal connectivity of the putamen with the whole-brain network. Thus, the results mentioned above were agreed with the accumulating evidence ( ,  ) and suggested that AVH are not solely associated with local brain dysfunction, but with abnormal neural networks, including cognitive control, motor, and perception processing systems. \n\nHowever, low-frequency rTMS treatment over the left TPJ appeared to enhance the involvement of these dysfunctional brain regions and help restore their normal functions. Specifically, the putamen is rich in dopaminergic neurons, and abnormal dopaminergic transmission in the putamen is related to positive symptoms such as hallucinations ( ). Therefore, increased connectivity with the putamen after active rTMS treatment in patients could normalize the dopaminergic activity of basal ganglia and contribute to the reduction of positive symptoms. Moreover, the supplementary motor cortex is involved in the imaging of speech in addition to movements ( ). During an auditory verbal imagery task (imaging a sentence being spoken by another person), which requires generating and monitoring inner speech, schizophrenia patients with AVH had reduced activation in the supplementary motor area ( ). The authors clarify that a predisposition to verbal hallucinations may be related to an inability to activate areas involved in monitoring inner language. In addition, the inferior temporal gyrus subserves language and sematic processing ( ). Patients with AVH had increased local spontaneous neural activity in the inferior temporal gyrus ( ). Thus, functional abnormalities in the cortices may cause a mismatch between perceived and predicted outcomes of intrinsic speech activity and associate with the experience of AVH. We found that rTMS treatment significantly (or marginally) induced the alternated connectivity of the TPJ with the right inferior temporal gyrus and supplementary motor cortex, and then could result in a restoration of the cortical functions and a reduction in the severity of clinical symptoms. \n\nThe human brain works in a dynamic approach to integrate, coordinate, and respond to external and internal stimuli across multiple time scales ( ). Thus, DFC can capture the wealth of information contained within the time-varying features in interregional functional interactions and reveal additional alternations in schizophrenia that could not be discovered by SFC ( ,  ). We found that increased connectivity of the seed with the left inferior frontal gyrus and right inferior parietal lobule were detected only by the DFC approach in the active treatment group after rTMS stimulation. The left inferior frontal gyrus is involved in langue processing. Underactivation of the left inferior frontal gyrus has been reported in patients with schizophrenia during various langue tasks, including verbal learning and speech comprehension ( ), and semantic encoding ( ). The inferior parietal lobule is known to be a central hub of multisensory integration ( ). In schizophrenia, neuroimaging studies have found that the inferior parietal has reduced cortical thickness ( ), functional activation ( ), and hemispheric asymmetry ( ). Deficits in this area can cause perception dysfunction in schizophrenia ( ,  ). The enhanced synchronization of the seed with these two regions as detected by DFC in the active treatment group might be beneficial for the recovery of speech and perceptional functions. These findings provided a comprehensive understanding of the treatment effect of rTMS treatment in schizophrenia. \n\nDespite wed did not observe any clinical improvements after placebo treatment, some alternations based on the SFC and DFC analyses were presented in the placebo group, similar to the previous study ( ). The decreased connectivity of the seed with the most brain regions, including the cingulate cortex, insula, superior parietal lobule, and inferior occipital lobe, was observed, which may represent the continuous deterioration of clinical symptoms over time, since hypoconnectity is dominant in schizophrenia ( ,  ) and AVH ( ,  ), and these regions critically represent the pathophysiology of schizophrenia ( – ) as well as AVH ( ,  – ). On the contrast, the placebo group also had increased connectivity of the seed with certain parietal areas (e.g., left angular and left precuneus) by SFC analysis. Abnormal functional (e.g., hypoactivation) ( ,  ) and structural (e.g., reduced gray matter volume) ( ,  ) alternations in the left angular and left precuneus have been reported in schizophrenia and appeared to be correlated with the severity of AVH ( ,  ). Thus, the increased synchronization in these brain regions underlies core deficits of schizophrenia and may imply a neural compensation to overcome the primary functional defects in patients with AVH. Nevertheless, the results suggested that future studies may need to adequately seek the placebo effects and real rTMS effects by directly comparing placebo-responders and rTMS responder following rTMS treatment. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, we observed that clinical improvement in the active treatment group coincided with FC alternations of the TPJ seed over the course of rTMS treatment. Low-frequency rTMS treatment of the left TPJ area could modulate neural circuits implicated in AVH, which contribute to the clinical improvement in schizophrenia. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in this study are included in the article/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors. \n\n\n## Ethics statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Xijing Hospital.

For example, glucose uptake and the dysfunctional spread of naturalistic and synthetic stimuli has proven useful to characterize hampered consciousness. However, understanding of the mechanisms behind loss of consciousness following brain injury is still missing. Here, we study the propagation of endogenous and in‐silico exogenous perturbations in patients with disorders of consciousness, based upon directed and causal interactions estimated from resting‐state fMRI data, fitted to a linear model of activity propagation. We found that patients with disorders of consciousness suffer decreased capacity for neural propagation and responsiveness to events, and that this can be related to severe reduction of glucose metabolism as measured with [ F]FDG‐PET. In particular, we show that loss of consciousness is related to the malfunctioning of two neural circuits: the posterior cortical regions failing to convey information, in conjunction with reduced broadcasting of information from subcortical, temporal, parietal and frontal regions. These results shed light on the mechanisms behind disorders of consciousness, triangulating network function with basic measures of brain integrity and behavior. \n  \nPropagation of neural events and network responses are disrupted in patients with disorders of consciousness. Loss of consciousness is related to the malfunctioning of two neural circuits: The posterior cortical regions fail to integrate information in altered consciousness and a breakdown of information broadcasting of subcortical cortical areas. Loss of network responses in these patients is related to glucose metabolism.   \n \n\n# Body\n   Abbreviations    [ ]FDG‐PET   \nfluoro‐deoxyglucose positron emission tomography or glucose PET \n    BOLD   \nBLOOD oxygenation level dependent \n    CRS‐R   \nComa recovery scale‐revised \n    DoC   \ndisorders of consciousness \n    EC   \neffective connectivity \n    fMRI   \nfunctional MRI \n    HC   \nhealthy control \n    MCS   \nminimally conscious state \n    MOU   \nmultivariate Ornstein‐Uhlenbeck \n    PCC   \nposterior cingulate cortex \n    SC   \nstructural connectivity \n    UWS   \nunresponsive wakefulness syndrome \n     τ    \nrelaxation time constant \n   \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nConsciousness is a subjective experience. Internally perceived as the personal experience of “what is it like, to be you,” the definition of consciousness and its origin are still a matter of scientific and philosophical debates without consensus (Damasio & Meyer,  ; Nagel,  ; Tononi,  ; Tononi et al.,  ). Within the clinical context, however, practitioners treating patients with severe brain injuries and disorders of consciousness (DoC) face the daily reality to help their patients in the best possible manner, regardless of the exact definition of consciousness. For that, it is important to better understand the mechanisms behind pathological loss of consciousness and its recovery, and to count with tangible correlates that accurately assess the state of the patients. The introduction of methods based on neuroimaging can help achieve these goals by providing complementary information to improve diagnosis and decision making (Owen & Coleman,  ). \n\nBehavioral assessment such as the response to sensory stimuli, pain or simple commands is the first line of action taken at bedside to evaluate patients. From this perspective, consciousness is often characterized based on two components: wakefulness (the level of arousal) and awareness (the content of one's conscious experience) (Demertzi et al.,  ; Laureys,  ). Patients with severe brain injury can fall into a coma, which is characterized by the absence of both wakefulness and awareness. Patients surviving coma often recover signs of wakefulness, that is, eye‐opening, but without manifestation of awareness of the self nor of the environment. Such state is known as the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) (Laureys,  ). Some of these patients gradually regain awareness and progress into the so‐called minimally conscious state (MCS), showing a wider range of non‐reflexive behaviors such as visual pursuit, localization to pain or response to simple commands, although their ability to functionally communicate remains hampered (Laureys et al.,  ). While behavioral assessment is the standard approach for diagnosis of DoC patients, recently the use of glucose PET (i.e., [ F]FDG‐PET) has proven valuable to enhance the accuracy of the diagnosis (Thibaut et al.,  ). Along these lines, the value of auxiliary assessments such as neuroimaging methods are indicated to refine diagnosis (Giacino et al.,  ; Kondziella et al.,  ), and especially to gain understanding of the mechanisms behind the loss and the recovery of consciousness that might form the foundation for the development of new treatments. \n\nIn recent years, the study of the brain's dynamical activity is emerging as a promising approach to assess brain states. It is well‐known that neural activity is characterized by different frequency bands across sleep stages (Armitage,  ) or cognitive processes, and that local field potentials display intercalated epochs of bursting activity followed by silent periods during anesthesia (Silva et al.,  ). Recent studies have shown that loss of consciousness leads to reduced spontaneous neural activity (Wenzel et al.,  ) and that functional connectivity between brain regions is also significantly reduced (Barttfeld et al.,  ; Bettinardi et al.,  ; Demertzi et al.,  ; Thibaut et al.,  ). Moreover, the patterns of fluctuating functional connectivity are altered during reduced consciousness, with functional patterns of shorter duration and more random transitions between them as compared to normal wakefulness (Barttfeld et al.,  ; Demertzi et al.,  ; López‐González et al.,  ; Luppi et al.,  ). \n\nObserving how external perturbations propagate through the brain constitutes a window to probe brain dynamics and to evaluate their integrity in different states. For example, natural audio‐visual stimuli presented to subjects undergoing general anesthesia or within deep sleep are still processed in the sensory cortices but fail to integrate at the higher level cortical regions (Arena et al.,  ; Ishizawa et al.,  ; Krom et al.,  ; Pavone et al.,  ; Portas et al.,  ; Sela et al.,  ). Application of artificial perturbations such as transcranial magnetic stimulation triggers a response of the stimulated regions that is comparable across conditions, but a rapid decline in the propagation of the signals is found during deep sleep, anesthesia or in patients with DoC (Casali et al.,  ; Massimini et al.,  ). These observations have been successfully employed to classify the level of consciousness both in patients and during anesthesia (Casali et al.,  ). However, as the procedure focuses on the description of the whole‐brain responses by a single number—the perturbational complexity index—it misses the directionality of the evoked causal interactions. These causal interactions have been demonstrated to be sensitive to different states of consciousness and moreover to hold explanatory power with respect to their neural mechanisms (Seth et al.,  ; Signorelli et al.,  ). \n\nIn the present paper, we investigate the capacity of both endogenous and exogenous events to propagate throughout the brain in patients with DoC by use of model‐free and model‐based analyses of resting‐state activity, as measured via functional MRI. First, we studied how spontaneous endogenous events within the resting‐state blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals propagate and are subsequently integrated (Deco & Kringelbach,  ). Also, we found that the intrinsic relaxation times of the BOLD signals exhibit a heterogeneous map of spatial distributions in the healthy brain that homogenises in patients, especially in the UWS group. Second, we employed a model‐based approach of linear propagation to estimate the pair‐wise effective connectivity between brain regions (Gilson et al.,  ; Gilson et al.,  ). Since effective connectivity captures the directional causal relations, we could simulate the asymmetrical propagation of exogenous perturbations in the brain in order to recognize changes in the ability of brain areas to ‘broadcast’ or to ‘receive’ converging information. In particular, we found two well‐differentiated subnetworks with altered propagation properties in the patients. The posterior regions of the cortex fail to convey information, while broadcasting of information is reduced in subcortical, temporal, parietal and frontal regions. We could confirm that these results correlate with the decrease in cerebral glucose metabolism as measured with [ F]FDG‐PET, reinforcing the evidence that the brain activity in patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness lack the sufficient capacity to propagate and subsequently integrate events, which are necessary conditions for conscious perception. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe included subjects with a pathological reduction or loss of consciousness after severe brain injury, called disorders of consciousness (DoCs), as well as healthy control (HC) volunteers. Written informed consent was obtained from all HC participants and the legal representative of DoC patients for participation in the study. The local ethics committee from the University Hospital of Liège (Belgium) approved the study. This study includes 40 adult DoC patients, of which 26 were diagnosed as in minimally conscious state (MCS) (7 females, age range 23–73 years; mean age ± SD, 41 ± 13 years) and 14 were diagnosed with the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) (7 females, age range 20–74 years; mean age ± SD, 49 ± 16 years). Besides, 33 age and gender‐matched healthy controls (HC) (13 females, age range 19–72 years; mean age ± SD, 40 ± 14 years) without premorbid neurological problems were included. The diagnosis of the DoC patients was confirmed through two standard approaches. The first is the repeated behavioral assessment using the Coma Recovery Scale‐Revised (CRS‐R) by trained clinicians and second, using Fluoro‐deoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG‐PET) neuroimaging as an objective test to complement behavioral assessment according to the procedure described by Stender et al. ( ). Patients were behaviorally diagnosed through the best of at least five CRS‐R assessments evaluating auditory, visual, motor, oromotor function, communication and arousal (Giacino et al.,  ). Patients for whom these two diagnostic approaches disagreed were excluded from further analysis. Disorders of consciousness occur for a variety of reasons (etiology). Among the 40 patients 17 suffered from anoxia causing widespread neuronal death and 22 of traumatic brain injuries (TBI), that also were grouped with patients presenting with a DoC after a hemorrhagic stroke or cerebral vascular accident (CVA) leading to more focal lesions. Among the patients diagnosed with UWS, 11 suffered anoxia and 3 TBI whereas the MCS group consists of 6 patients with anoxia and 19 with TBI. Patient specific clinical information is presented in Table  . \n\n\n###  MRI   data acquisition \n  \nStructural (T1 and diffusion weighted imaging, DWI) and functional MRI (fMRI) data was acquired on a Siemens 3T Trio scanner. The 3D T1‐weighted MP‐RAGE images (120 transversal slices, repetition time = 2300 ms, voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.2 mm , flip angle = 9°, field of view = 256 × 256 mm ) were acquired prior to the 10 min of BOLD fMRI resting state (i.e., task free) acquisition (EPI, gradient echo, volumes = 300, repetition time = 2000 ms, echo time = 30 ms, flip angle = 78°, voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm , field of view = 192 × 192 mm , 32 transversal slices). Last, diffusion weighted MRI was acquired in 64 directions (  b  ‐value =1000 s/mm , voxel size = 1.8 × 1.8 × 3.3 mm , field of view 230 × 230 mm , repetition time 5700 ms, echo time 87 ms, 45 transverse slices, 128 × 128 matrix) preceded by a single unweighted image (b0). \n\n\n###  MRI   data analysis \n  \n####  MRI   data preprocessing \n  \nPreprocessing was performed using MELODIC (Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components) version 3.14, which is part of FMRIB's Software Library (FSL,  ). The preprocessing consisted of the following steps: the first five functional images were discarded to reduce scanner inhomogeneity, motion correction was performed using MCFLIRT, non‐brain tissue was removed using BET, intensity was normalized, temporal band‐pass filtering with sigma 100 s was performed, spatial smoothing was applied using a 5 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel, rigid‐body registration and single‐session ICA with automatic dimensionality. Then noise components and lesion‐driven artifacts (e.g., head movement, metal, and physiological noise artifacts) were manually regressed out for each subject. Specifically, FSLeyes in Melodic mode was used to identify the single‐subject Independent Components (ICs) into “good” for cerebral signal, “bad” for noise or injury‐driven artifacts, and “unknown” for ambiguous components. Each component was evaluated based on the spatial map, the time series, and the temporal power spectrum (Griffanti et al.,  ). FIX was applied with default parameters to remove bad and lesion‐driven artifacts components (Griffanti et al.,  ). Then, the Shen et al. ( ) functional resting state atlas (without cerebellum) was used for parcellating the BOLD into   n   = 214 time series of cortical and subcortical brain areas in each individual's native EPI space (Finn et al.,  ). The cleaned functional data were co‐registered to the T1‐weighted structural image using FLIRT. Then, the T1‐weighted image was co‐registered to the standard MNI space by using FLIRT (12 DOF), and FNIRT. This transformation matrix was inverted and applied to warp the resting‐state atlas from MNI space to the single‐subject functional data. Finally, the time series for each of the 214 regions brain areas were extracted using custom‐made Matlab scripts using “fslmaths” and “fslmeants.” \n\n\n#### Structural connectivity matrix \n  \nWe computed an average whole‐brain structural connectivity matrix from all healthy participants as described in our previous study (López‐González et al.,  ). Briefly, the b0 image in native diffusion space was co‐registered to the T1 structural image using FLIRT. Next, the T1 structural image was co‐registered to the MNI space by using FLIRT and FNIRT. The resulting transformations were inverted and applied to warp the resting‐state atlas from MNI space to the native diffusion space using a nearest‐neighbor interpolation method. Then, analysis of diffusion images was performed using the FMRIB's Diffusion Toolbox (FDT)  . The structural connectivity matrices were then constructed for the same parcellation as employed to parcellate the BOLD signals, Shen et al. ( ) with   n   = 214 cortical and subcortical areas. The structural connectivity (SC) mask was obtained by averaging all HC subjects' SC matrix and applying a threshold of 80% to maintain the top 20% of strongest connections to binarize the SC. This SC mask was used to constrain the functional connectivity matrix for the whole brain EC computation. \n\n\n#### Intrinsic ignition \n  \nIntrinsic ignition is a measure to quantify the level of integration elicited by spontaneously occurring local events in the brain's activity (Deco et al.,  ; Deco & Kringelbach,  ). Given the BOLD signals   measured during a resting‐state session, intrinsic ignition is calculated in three steps: (i) identification of intrinsic (endogenous) events occurring in the BOLD, (ii) calculation of the network integration elicited by each of the endogenous events and, (iii) intrinsic ignition is the average of integration evaluated over all events. \n\nFirst, an intrinsic event is defined as a significant fluctuation spontaneously occurring in the resting‐state BOLD of a brain area. An event is said to occur in area   i   at time   t’   whenever the signal   surpasses a threshold of   θ =   2 standard deviations. Second, the integration elicited by an event is obtained from the functional connectivity (FC) matrix (excluding region   i  ) estimated in a short time window   t  ′   → t  ′ + 4TR after the event occurrence. Specifically, the size of the largest connected component in the binarised FC matrix is calculated across all thresholds from one to zero. The integration elicited by the event is thus the area‐under‐the‐curve for the largest component sizes across thresholds. Here, FC is calculated as the phase‐locking value between two BOLD signals instead of employing Pearson's correlation. The phase‐locking approach allows to estimate an FC matrix at each time‐point and to avoid errors of computing correlation over short windows (Hindriks et al.,  ). Last, intrinsic ignition is the average of integration values obtained for all events identified. \n\nFor completeness, the analysis was repeated considering various thresholds from   θ   = 0.5 to   θ   = 2.5 standard deviations. When   θ   ≥ 2.5 no intrinsic events were observed in the BOLD of some subjects for each group (UWS = 8; MCS = 9 and HC = 7) and thus ignition could not be calculated. \n\n\n#### Relaxation time constants (  τ  ) \n  \nIn order to obtain information about the operating regime of brain regions, we measured the relaxation time constant   τ   from the autocovariances of the BOLD signals. Specifically,   τ   represents the time a signal needs to decay towards its rest. The larger the   τ   the longer it takes for the activity of a region to decay and, the smaller it is   the faster the activity decays. Given that   and   are the 0‐TR‐lag and the 1‐TR‐lag covariance matrices obtained from the empirical BOLD, the time constants   are calculated as: where   corresponds to the slope of the linear regression of   by  . \n\n\n#### Estimation of effective connectivity \n  \nThe estimation of effective connectivity (EC) is a model‐based procedure that fits simulated data to empirical data by adjusting the pair‐wise connection strengths between the regions. Hence, EC represents the most likely set of connectivity strengths that—for the particular dynamical model employed—lead to simulation results closest to empirical data. In our case, we used the multivariate Ornsteing‐Uhlenbeck (MOU) process as the generative model of choice for the BOLD signals (Gilson et al.,  ). The MOU is a model of linear propagation in a network in which the activity is generated by injecting Gaussian noise at the regions. The MOU has been widely used to study the relation between the structural and functional connectivities (Barnett et al.,  ; Galán,  ; Messé et al.,  ; Tononi & Sporns,  ,  ; Zamora‐López et al.,  ,   ). Given a network of   n   regions and their   connectivity matrix   A   (either binary or real weighted) the MOU is formally defined as: where   is the activity (BOLD signal) of a brain region   i  ,   is the time constant characterizing the rate of the exponential decay of the brain region and   dB   represents white noise given by covariance matrix   B  . \n\nOne of the main benefits of the MOU is that the 0‐lag   and the 1‐lag   covariance matrices of the system can be analytically calculated, thus avoiding the need to run time‐consuming numerical simulations to generate the signals from which the covariances are determined. Hence, MOU‐EC is a method that fits the model parameters (via a Lyapunov optimization procedure) in order to minimise the distance (L1‐norm) between the   and   empirically extracted from the BOLD, and the corresponding   matrices estimated out of the MOU system (Adhikari et al.,  ; Gilson et al.,  ). In particular, the optimization procedure iteratively adjusts the pair‐wise connection strengths (weights of connectivity matrix   A  ) and the levels of covariances of the Gaussian noise injected at each region (diagonal entries of matrix   B  ). Thus, EC is the weighted connectivity matrix   A'   that results at the end of the iterative optimization process. Estimation of MOU‐EC was carried out using the   pyMOU   Python package, see the “Data availability statement.” \n\nIn this study, individual EC matrices were estimated for all HC participants, patients with UWS and partially recovered patients in MCS. A limitation of EC estimation for the whole‐brain is the large number of free parameters to be fitted, namely, the   n   entries of the connectivity matrix   A   and the   n   entries for the covariances of the Gaussian white noise inputs. Given the limited temporal resolution of the BOLD it becomes necessary to restrict the number of free parameters in order to avoid estimation “noise.” For that, the estimated EC (connectivity matrix   A   in Equation ( )) was constrained by the binarised average SC of the HC participants, tuning only the 20% strongest anatomical connections. Also, we restricted the optimization to the diagonal entries of the B matrix (i.e., input variances) assuming that each brain region receives an independent Gaussian white noise. As a consequence, the fitting involved 0.2  n   \n  + n   free parameters, a 10% of the total. \n\n\n#### In‐silico exogenous perturbational analysis \n  \nTo investigate the propagation of perturbations throughout the brains of the HC participants and of the patients we employed a model‐based approach to study networks through the analysis of their responses to inputs (Gilson et al.,  ). The method considers the linear model of activity propagation in Equation ( ). The second term of Equation ( ),  , represents the actual propagation of activity across the connectivity and how nodes influence each other. This mutual influence is exerted not only over direct connections or shortest paths as in the sense of graph distance, but it accounts for the activity propagated over all recurrent paths of different lengths. Indeed, as stated above, the matrix   A   can be either binary or weighted, thus comprising the general case of arbitrary connection strengths between regions. It shall be noted that when all values of   A   are positive this term diverges, leading to infinite network activity. On the contrary, the first term of Equation (2),   is a leakage or dissipation term representing an exponential decay of the activity at each region, with the decay rate determined by  . For small enough values of  —say, fast enough leakage—the divergent behaviour of the second term is counterbalanced through this dissipation term. Thus, the goal is to study the transient response of a network to external perturbations as its activity raises in the short term and decays in the longer time. \n\nFor the analysis in this study, we consider the canonical case in which an external unit perturbation is applied to every brain region simultaneously and we studied the subsequent responses. Figure   summarises the conceptual rationale behind this perturbational approach using a small network as an example. At time   every region receives a spike input of unit strength. In practice, this is achieved by setting the noise covariance matrix   B   to be the identity matrix, with all diagonal entries   and   otherwise. Taking advantage of the simplicity of the MOU process, as for the EC estimation, there is no need to run numerical simulations to obtain the network responses since they can be calculated analytically. The solution of the linear system in Equation ( ) with initial conditions is   given, in vector form, by   where  is the Jacobian matrix of the linear system and   is the Dirac‐delta taking values   when   i = j  , and   otherwise. Assuming initial conditions   we have that the matrix   is the response function to a unit perturbation. Depending on the field of research, the unit response function is often named as the Green function (Selçuk Bayin,  ) or the propagation kernel. Finally, since we are only interested in quantifying the part of the influence that nodes exert on each other through the connectivity, we regress out the trivial self‐responses of the regions to the external input, which is governed by the Jacobian of the first term,  . Hence, we define the pair‐wise response function as where   is a normalization factor to compare across networks of different size. On the one hand, the pair‐wise elements   represent the conditional, temporal response of area   j   to a unit perturbation applied on area   i   at time   t   = 0. This conditional pair‐wise response encompasses all network effects from   i   to   j   acting at different time scales along all recurrent paths of different lengths. On the other hand, at every time point   t  ,   is an   matrix revealing how the spatio‐temporal interaction patterns that emerge from connectivity   A   evolve over time. See Figure   for illustration. \n  \nNetwork analysis via simulation of perturbation‐responses. (a) Temporal evolution of pair‐wise responses to an initial unit perturbations at time   applied at every node of a sample network. The network is directed and weighted, thus pair‐wise responses are asymmetrical. The subsequent analysis of responses can be performed at different levels. (b) The global network response   is computed as the sum of all pair‐wise responses at each time   t  . Global network response rapidly peaks at time   t  * and slowly decays as a consequence of the leakage term in Equation ( ) resembling a dissipation of signal at the brain regions.   is thus the total accumulated response in the network and is calculated as the integral (area‐under‐the‐curve) of  . (c) The ‘Receiving’ capacity   is the temporal response of one node to all the inputs applied at  . It is thus a signature of how much of the network flows centralise at a given node, which is a (necessary but not sufficient) condition of a node to integrate information.   is calculated as the column‐sum of the response matrices  . (d) The ‘Broadcasting’ capacity   the nodes represent the influence that node   i   exerts over the network by quantifying the amount of response elicited over all the nodes by an input applied at node   i  . Thus,   is calculated as the row‐sum of the response matrices  . For illustration, the behaviour of two nodes,   and   are highlighted. Node 4 is a central and node 5 is a ‘leaf’ only connected to node 4. As a consequence, node 4 has the largest receiving and broadcasting capacities in the network. A strong connection 4 → 5 implies that node 5 is very much influenced by the network (large receiving) but a weak connection 5 → 4 results in that node 5 can barely influence the other nodes (low broadcasting). \n  \nThe response matrices   contain much information about the architecture of the network and several measures can be extracted from them. Here, we focus on two simple metrics. First, the global network response   representing the temporal evolution of the total amount of response propagated through the connectivity, Figure  . Thus,   is computed as the sum of the pair‐wise responses   of the   matrix at every time point   t  : \n\nSecond, we characterise the temporal evolution of the response   for every region. As this perturbational method accounts for arbitrary connectivity matrices   A  , either binary or weighted, it also naturally accounts for the case in which   A   represents a directed or an asymmetric connectivity. Therefore, for every region we can define both their input and output properties. We define the broadcasting   and the receiving   of a brain region as: \n\nThe receiving   quantifies the temporal response of region   i   to all the inputs simultaneously applied at time  , see Figure  . Hence, conceptually   represents how sensitive is a region within the network. On the contrary, as illustrated in Figure  , the broadcasting   quantifies the temporal response of the entire network due to the unit perturbation that was applied in region   i   at time  . Thus,   represents the influence that region   i   exerts over the whole network. While  ,   and   quantify the temporal evolution of the network and of the regional responses, the total responses  ,   and   are defined as the accumulated responses over time—say, the integral or area‐under‐the‐curve from   to   as illustrated by the shaded regions of Figure  . \n\nIn the present study, we applied the perturbational network analysis following the procedures in Gilson et al.,  . The parameters of Equation ( ) were constrained by information extracted from the empirical data. Namely, the connectivity matrices   A   were replaced by the EC matrices previously computed for each subject and the relaxation time constants   were precomputed from the BOLD signals of the brain regions. The benefit of doing so is that the complete analysis and modeling pipeline is based on the same model, assumptions and limitations, thus allowing for a coherent interpretation of the results at every step (Gilson et al.,  ). All calculations were carried out using the   NetDynFlow   Python package, see the “Data availability statement.” \n\n\n#### Metabolic index using [  F  ]  FDG‐PET  \n  \nAlongside the MRI analyses, we have estimated the cerebral glucose metabolism by means of the metabolic index for the best‐preserved hemisphere (MIBH) using [ F]FDG‐PET, that shows high accuracy to discriminate between UWS and MCS patients. To this end, data acquisition was performed with a Gemini PET‐CT (Philips Medical Systems) while receiving a bolus intravenous injection of FDG (185–370 MBq). The data was recorded in a single 12‐minute emission frame after a 30‐minute uptake phase and the images were corrected for attenuation (Annen et al.,  ; Stender et al.,  ). The following steps were followed to calculate MIBH (Stender et al.,  ,  ). First, we created a population‐specific template for the patients (by taking all DoC patients) and control groups to overcome the problem of big deformations due to brain lesions and atrophy by following the approach of previous studies (Annen et al.,  ; Phillips et al.,  , Stender et al.,  ; Thibaut et al.,  ). The population‐specific templates were built in three steps. First registering the [ F]FDG‐PET images of each subject to the  O‐H O‐PET‐template available in the SPM toolbox using an affine transformation individually for every subject. Then all the subject's coregistered images were averaged by group (i.e., HC, MCS, UWS) to create a study specific preliminary template. Secondly, an intermediate template was created by registering all individual [ F]FDG‐PET images to the aforementioned preliminary template using affine and non‐linear registration steps which was then averaged. Finally, the previous registration and averaging steps were iterated four times to create final population‐specific [ F]FDG‐PET templates (Phillips et al.,  ). After creating the template, individual images were registered to the appropriate template (for patients or healthy controls) with affine and non‐linear registration steps using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs version 2.0.3). Images were then segmented into the left and right cortical regions, extracerebral tissue and normalized based on the metabolism of the extracerebral tissue in reference to control as described by Stender and colleagues (Stender et al.,  ). Last, metabolic activity was scaled by setting the mean activity of extracerebral regions to an index value of 1 by transforming from 0 to 1. The MIBH was then computed as the highest mean metabolic activity out of the two hemispheres (Stender et al.,  ,  ). \n\n\n#### Statistical analyses \n  \nFor the model‐free measures, the group differences were assessed using two‐sample   t  ‐tests for the global intrinsic ignition and relaxation time constant   τ   at the whole brain level (Bonferroni correction for three groups). Specifically, we investigated local between group differences in regional relaxation time constant   τ   using two‐sample   t  ‐tests with Bonferroni correction (  p   < 0.05) accounting for the number of regions (i.e.,   n   = 214). \n\nFor the model‐based measures, we assessed between group differences for the EC links using two‐sample   t  ‐tests with Bonferroni correction (  p   < 0.05) accounting for 20% of the number of the structural links between the brain regions (i.e., 9116 links). Then, we assessed between group differences in whole‐brain total (i.e., receiving and broadcasting) network response. The whole brain network response was calculated as the average network response across all the brain regions. An ANOVA with Tukey post hoc comparison, Bonferroni corrected for 200 time points of integration, was employed. Before assessing the local broadcasting and receiving differences, we first evaluated the effect of etiology (anoxia and TBI) versus diagnosis (UWS and MCS) for whole brain early peak responses (i.e., the maximum amplitude of the whole brain network response curve) and late whole brain network responses (i.e., from integration time 60–200 s [modeled time], based on the findings of the ANOVA described above) using a linear regression model as implemented in MATLAB (i.e., fitlm function). Both the mean effects for diagnosis and etiology were considered as well as their interaction. Regional modulation of the responses   was evaluated only for factors with a significant main effect on global network response  . \n\nTo investigate local broadcasting and receiving properties, we considered the area under the receiving and broadcasting curves (i.e., from integration time 60–200 s modeled time) separately for every brain region. We identified regions with relatively high difference in network responses within groups (i.e., HC, UWS and MCS separately) with a one‐sample   t  ‐test (against the mean of all brain regions and subjects of the group) with Bonferroni correction (  p   < 0.05) accounting for the number of regions (i.e.,   n   = 214). We identified the regional dominance for broadcasting and receiving by subtracting the areas (integral) between the regional receiving and the broadcasting curves,   and performed a within‐group   t  ‐test to identify regions with specific functional specialization (considered significant at   p   < 0.05 Bonferroni corrected for   n   = 214). Last, between group differences in regional receiving and broadcasting information were assessed with two‐sample   t  ‐tests with Bonferroni correction (  p   < 0.05) accounting for the number of regions (i.e.,   n   = 214). \n\nWe computed differences in the MIBH between UWS and MCS groups using a two‐sample   t  ‐test. Finally, we correlate the MIBH and behavioral assessment (CRS‐R) values of DoC patients' with their network response (i.e., of regions with alterations as compared to healthy controls) using Pearson correlation (considered significant at   p   < 0.05) to explore if the brain network response measured using computational models is related to whole brain metabolism at rest and behavioral profile. \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nThis study comprises resting‐state fMRI (eyes‐closed) of 33 healthy control (HC) subjects, 14 patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and 26 patients classified as in minimally conscious state (MCS). The diagnoses were made using repeated CRS‐R assessments and confirmed with FDG‐PET neuroimaging (Stender et al.,  ) to avoid including MCS* patients (i.e., patients who do not show behavioral signs of consciousness but with preserved brain metabolism suggesting that they might be conscious) (Thibaut et al.,  ). \n\n### Global integration of local endogenous events is hampered in lower conscious states \n  \nWe started this study by investigating whether endogenous spontaneous events occurring locally propagate differently depending on the level of consciousness, across healthy controls, MCS or UWS patients. For that, we employed the   intrinsic ignition   measure which estimates the capacity for information integration elicited by spontaneously occurring local events in the brain's activity (Deco & Kringelbach,  ). The level of global intrinsic ignition for one subject is calculated as the average integration triggered by all endogenous events identified during in a resting‐state session, Figure  . The whole brain intrinsic ignition is the average of all the brain region intrinsic ignition. The whole brain intrinsic ignition was lowest for patients with UWS, Figure  , implying that the endogenous BOLD events lead to a lower network response than in healthy controls and in MCS patients (HC = 0.82 ± 0.02, UWS = 0.78 ± 0.02, MCS = 0.79 ± 0.02, HC vs. UWS   t  (45) = 6.0,   p   < 0.0001, HC vs. MCS   t  (57) = 4.6,   p   < 0.0001, MCS vs. UWS   t  (38) = 2.0,   p   = 0.029). Also, it shall be noted that the number of observed intrinsic events was lowest in UWS, intermediate in MCS patients and highest in healthy controls (HC = 14.1 ± 3.6, UWS = 7.6 ± 2.9, MCS = 11.0 ± 3.6, HC vs. UWS   t  (45) = 5.9,   p   < 0.0001, HC vs. MCS   t  (57) = 3.3,   p   = 0.0017, MCS vs. UWS   t  (38) = 2.9,   p   = 0.0048). These results were obtained for events defined at BOLD signals overcoming a threshold   θ   = 2 standard deviations. Equivalent results were found considering other thresholds (  θ   = 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5), see Figure  . \n  \nChanges in endogenous properties from resting‐state BOLD signals in healthy controls (HC), unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS). (a) Illustration of intrinsic ignition computation overview consisting of the identification of intrinsic (endogenous) events occurring in the BOLD and calculation of the network integration (using largest subcomponent of phase lag connectivity) elicited by each of the intrinsic events in a short time window. (b) Comparison of mean intrinsic ignition for the three groups, illustrating the reduced capacity to integrate endogenous spontaneous events in patients with DoC. (c) Representation of the relaxation (autocorrelation) time‐scales of the BOLD signals (  τ  ). A shorter   τ   implies a faster decay of the signal and a lower memory depth.

(e, f) Maps of significant differences in regional distributions of τ between patients and controls. The color bar represents the   t  ‐values of significant between‐group differences (Bonferroni corrected for 214 tests,   p  ‐value = 0.05). \n  \n\n### Shorter relaxation‐time of   BOLD   signals in low levels of consciousness \n  \nAlterations in the inherent time‐scales of signals can reveal changes in the underlying mechanisms controlling the local dynamics and determining their operating regime. Specifically, the autocovariance profile of the BOLD for one brain area estimates the duration for which the signal is altered before going back to pre‐event baseline activity (Murray et al.,  ), as illustrated in Figure  . Here, we measured the autocovariance time constant   τ  , also called the   relaxation time   or   memory depth   in the literature. Large   τ   implies a longer lingering effect of a signal after an event or perturbation before it decays, thus suggesting that the brain region might remain available for processing longer. \n\nAt a whole‐brain level, averaging over the   for all regions in one subject, we found that τ was shorter in patients with UWS (1.96 ± 0.38) than in healthy controls (2.72 ± 0.35;   t  (45) = 6.5,   p   < 0.0001) and MCS patients (2.70 ± 0.58;   t  (38) = 4.2,   p   < 0.001), see Figure  . Looking at the spatial distributions, we found a heterogeneous gradient of   in healthy controls with shorter time constants in subcortical areas (  ~ 1.5 s) and longer (  ~ 3.5 s) in the frontal and parietal areas, see Figure  . Importantly, the diversity of relaxation times is lost in UWS with   being homogeneously distributed and dominated by small values. Compared to healthy controls, the decrease of   in patients with UWS was most predominant in the bilateral thalamus, right caudate, left hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral posterior, middle and anterior cingulate, insula, inferior, middle, superior and dorsolateral frontal areas, Figure   and Table  . In the case of MCS patients   shows a similar heterogeneous spatial distribution to that of HC, Figure  . Compared to the healthy controls, in MCS patients   was lower only in the bilateral thalamus and left medial prefrontal cortex, see Figure   and Table  . \n\nThe results reported so far indicate a breakdown in the spatiotemporal structure of the BOLD signals that involves reduced propagation and integration capabilities of endogenous events in DoC patients, especially in the UWS group. For the remaining of the paper we shift to model‐based analyses. \n\n\n### Whole‐brain effective connectivity shows altered causal interactions in   DoC   patients \n  \nIn order to identify alterations to the causal relations between the brain regions, we computed the whole‐brain effective connectivity (EC) from the resting‐state BOLD for each subject. In short, the estimation of EC consists of identifying the most likely connectivity that gives rise to the observed data, fitting a generative dynamical model. In our case, this implied to adjust the pair‐wise connection strengths between the brain regions through an optimization procedure such that the resulting covariances are closest to the empirical ones (Adhikari et al.,  ; Gilson et al.,  ), see Figure  . As the generative model of the signals we considered the multivariate Ornstein‐Uhlenbeck process in Equation ( ). This is a model of noise diffusion on a network for which the covariance matrices can be analytically estimated, thus allowing for a fast optimization. \n  \nComparison of effective connectivity (EC) between healthy controls and patients. (a) Schematic representation of the fitting procedure leading to estimation of EC. Considering a model of noise diffusion—the multivariate Ornstein‐Uhlenbeck process—the whole‐brain network model is constrained using structural connectivity obtained from diffusion imaging and then fitted to reproduce the empirical resting‐state data. In particular, to fit the zero‐lag and 1TR‐lag covariance matrices   and  , and the regional noise level ∑ . (b, c) Maps of significantly different EC connections between patients and controls. UWS patients show connections with both decreased and increased EC (decreased in fronto‐temporal, frontal–parietal and midline regions; increased in subcortical and wide cortical areas). Blue and red arrows indicate lower and higher EC, respectively, in patients as compared to HC subjects. MCS patients show decreased EC in fronto‐temporal and interhemispheric midline connections. The directional connections in the glass brain represents connections with significant between‐group differences (Bonferroni corrected for 11,395 tests,   p  ‐value < 0.05) are represented. \n  \nAt the whole‐brain level, averaging all the connections in a subject, we found that the EC of in patients with UWS was higher than for the healthy controls or than in MCS patients (HC = 0.015 ± 0.002, UWS = 0.019 ± 0.004, MCS = 0.014 ± 0.003; HC vs. UWS   t  (45) = −4.7,   p   < 0.0001, MCS vs. UWS   t  (38) = −4.0,   p   < 0.001). A closer inspection of the pair‐wise EC values revealed the presence of links that either increased or decreased in UWS with respect to the healthy controls, Figure  . The patients with UWS showed increased EC for connections in the subcortical (thalamus, caudate and putamen) and cortical regions, but also decreased EC in connections spanning posterior (i.e., parietal, occipital) to frontal (i.e., temporal and frontal) regions as well as between midline posterior regions (parietal, occipital) and middle frontal regions. The MCS patients showed especially lower EC in interactions from posterior to frontal and temporal regions and midline regions encompassing the middle prefrontal and posterior cortex and the thalamus, see Figure  , including regions important for long range connectivity and overlapping with key areas of the Default Mode Network (i.e., Posterior cortex, middle frontal, bilateral inferior parietal and temporal). \n\n\n### Altered spatiotemporal propagation of exogenous perturbations \n  \nHaving identified changes in specific pair‐wise EC connections for both UWS and MCS patients, the remaining question is how those alterations affect the propagation of information throughout the brain. To investigate this question, we performed an in‐silico perturbational study and evaluated how exogenous perturbations spread in the three conditions. For that, we considered again, as for the EC estimation, the multivariate Ornstein‐Uhlenbeck process to be the generative dynamical model of the brain activity. Applying a unit perturbation to every brain region at time  , the pair‐wise responses are analytically estimated as in Equation ( ). The resulting spatio‐temporal responses   carry information of the spread of activity (Gilson et al.,  ,  ), Figures   and  . Specifically, the pair‐wise elements   represent the pair‐wise temporal response of area   j   to the unit perturbation applied on area   i  . This conditional response encompasses all network effects from   i   to   j   acting at different time scales over paths of different lengths. For the present study, the response analysis was performed on top of the EC matrices previously calculated for each participant—that is, the connectivity matrix   A   in Equation ( ) is replaced by the corresponding EC matrix of the subject—over which the propagation takes place. Also, the regional time‐constants   were constrained using the empirically calculated ones from the BOLD signals. First, we compared the global network response   r  (  t  ) across the three conditions. The global response quantifies the sum of all pair‐wise responses over time, typically characterised by a rapid transient increase followed by a slow decay, Figure  . Second, since EC captures the weighted and asymmetric connection strengths between the brain regions, we also studied the temporal evolution of the input and output responses   and   of every region, Figure  , representing the receiving and the broadcasting capacities of the brain areas. \n  \nIn‐silico propagation of exogenous perturbations. (a) Illustration of the propagation of simulated pair‐wise responses   to initial unit perturbations at  . Matrix elements   represent the conditional response at region   j   due to the unit perturbation initially applied at region   i  . (b) Temporal evolution of the response matrices   for healthy controls (HC) and patients (unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, UWS; minimally conscious state, MCS) at different times (early = 2 s, middle = 20 s, late 60 s and very late = 200 s). Note that here time corresponds to the arbitrary simulation time after the in‐silico perturbation is applied and thus it does not correspond to actual time, although the time‐constants governing the evolution were estimated from the BOLD signals. The colorbar represents the relative strength of the response between brain regions (unitless). (c) Whole brain response curves   for the three study cases reflecting the sum of all pair‐wise responses at each time point post‐stimulus (left panel). Shaded areas represent the 95% confidence intervals across subjects. Black stars indicate a difference in global responses between all three groups (Bonferroni corrected for 100 tests/time points,   p  ‐value = 0.05). Red stars indicate the early epoch during which UWS patients display a larger response than HC and MCS (Bonferroni corrected for 100 tests/time points,   p  ‐value = 0.05). The bar graph represents area‐under‐the‐curve for the three global response curves in the time range   t   = 60–200 s, quantifying the differences across the three groups (right panel). \n  \nSample response matrices for three participants are presented in Figure  . As seen, the patterns of responses are progressively reshaped over time for the three study groups—healthy controls, UWS patients and MCS patients. The group averaged global network responses are shown in Figure  . As expected, the global responses undergo a transient increase followed by a slower decay phase as the effects of the initial stimuli dissipate due to the leakage term of Equation ( ). This relaxation is also observed in the homogenization of the response matrices at the longer latencies in Figure  . The global response curves for controls and MCS groups follow quite a similar behavior, both peaking at 18.2 ± 2.9 and 15.6 ± 3.7 s, respectively, and taking peak values 0.30 ± 0.03 and 0.28 ± 0.05. In the UWS group, the global response peaks sooner (10.6 ± 2.9 s) (HC vs. UWS   t  (45) = 8.2,   p   < 0.0001, HC vs. MCS   t  (57) = 3.0,   p   = 0.0036, MCS vs. UWS   t  (38) = 4.3,   p   < 0.001) and displays a higher peak (0.34 ± 0.05) (HC vs. UWS   t  (45) = −3.3,   p   = 0.0019, MCS vs. UWS   t  (38) = −3.1,   p   = 0.0031) than for the controls and MCS groups, but then it decays notably faster. Quantitatively, we found that the area‐under‐the‐curve in the time spanning 60–200 s (modeled time) significantly decreases for the UWS group (0.08 ± 0.06) and MCS patients (0.15 ± 0.04) compared to healthy controls (0.18 ± 0.02) (HC vs. UWS   t  (45) = 7.1,   p   < 0.0001, HC vs. MCS   t  (57) = 2.9,   p   = 0.005, MCS vs. UWS   t  (38) = 3.6,   p   < 0.001). \n\n\n### Broadcasting and integrative capabilities of brain regions across states of consciousness \n  \nGiven that EC identifies the directed and weighted causal interactions, we could study the differentiated input and output responses—  and  —of each brain area in respect to the exogenous perturbations, see Figure   for illustration. First, in Figure  , the trajectories of the receiving and the broadcasting capacities for each brain region are compared plotting the two temporal trajectories against each other. Each panel shows the example for one participant. These results show that in the healthy participants some of the brain regions take a distinctive functional role, displaying either a dominant receiving or a broadcasting capacity. However, for the MCS and UWS patients such specialised regions are reduced or absent. \n  \nRegion‐wise broadcasting and receiving capacities due to exogenous perturbations. (a) Comparison between the temporal trajectories of the receiving   and the broadcasting   for different brain regions. Results for one sample participant shown in each panel. In healthy controls, an asymmetry between the receiving and broadcasting of several areas is observed suggesting a specialised functional role of those areas. This functional differentiation is lost in patients with UWS. Note that the end of the network response curve is cut at the end of the simulation time (200 s). Maps of significantly large broadcasting (b) and receiving capacities (c) for the three study groups (healthy controls, HC; unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, UWS; and minimally conscious state, MCS). The color code represents the   t  ‐values. Only regions with significantly high values are presented in each case (Bonferroni corrected   p  ‐values < 0.05 for 214 tests (brain regions). (d) Maps of regional specialization estimated as the difference   between the broadcasting and the receiving capacities of each brain region. \n  \nThe group average receiving and broadcasting capacities for the three conditions are mapped in Figure  . In the healthy controls, we found a few brain regions with simultaneous large broadcasting and receiving capacities: the bilateral occipital, calcarine, lingual, cuneus, precuneus, superior and inferior parietal, right middle temporal. Only significant broadcasting capacity was found in the bilateral middle and superior temporal, right inferior temporal, left parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral insula, inferior parietal, right supramarginal and right inferior frontal areas. And, only significant receiving capacity was identified for the bilateral thalamus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, middle cingulate and right supramarginal gyrus. In patients with UWS, however, we found that no brain region stands out either as a broadcaster or as a receiver; except for the thalamus which displays a relatively large receiving capacity. The group of MCS patients was characterized by a generalised reduction of both broadcasting and receiving capacities. A few areas displayed simultaneous significant receiving and broadcasting capacities: bilateral occipital, cuneus, bilateral superior and inferior parietal and precuneus. Preserved significant broadcasting was found in the left supramarginal area, Figure  , and significant receiving capacity was observed in the right thalamus, Figure  . See Table   for further details. \n\nFigure   summarises the functional specialization of the brain regions, which was evaluated as the area between the broadcasting and receiving curves such that  . The results suggest the presence of two distinct networks in healthy subjects: a receiving network prominently represented by the posterior cortex, the occipital cortex and the thalamus, and a broadcasting network encompassing parietal, temporal and frontal cortices. These two specialized functional networks show a strongly hampered flow in UWS patients with only preserved receiving capacity in the thalamus. In MCS patients, we observe that the two networks have been partially preserved, although flow in both receiving and broadcasting networks is diminished. The broadcasting network is smaller, yet the blueprint of the receiving network is largely preserved whereas these in MCS patients. \n\nHaving identified separate networks of brain areas specialised in either the integration or the broadcasting of activity, we finalise the model‐based perturbational analysis by directly comparing how these networks are altered in the patients, in respect to their configuration in the healthy controls, Figure  . As compared to HC, broadcasting capacity   was notably reduced in patients with UWS at the bilateral hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, caudate, amygdala, putamen, insula, inferior/middle temporal, temporal pole, right superior temporal, fusiform, lingual, calcarine, occipital, anterior cingulate, right inferior and middle frontal cortices. The lack of broadcasting capacity of the subcortical regions evidences a reduced activity of the whole brain network. Regarding the receiving capacity   was significantly reduced in patients with UWS at the bilateral precuneus, PCC, lingual, calcarine, fusiform, middle occipital, middle/anterior cingulum, inferior/superior parietal, supramarginal, middle temporal, inferior frontal cortices and the middle prefrontal cortex. These regions encompass primary visual and auditory areas, but also higher integration areas in the PCC that have an important hub function within the whole‐brain network, see Figure   and Table  . \n  \nGroup comparison of regional broadcasting and receiving capacities after exogenous perturbations.

Color bar represents the   t  ‐values for regions with significant between‐group differences (Bonferroni corrected   p  ‐values < 0.05 for 214 tests (brain regions). \n  \nCompared to healthy controls the MCS patients showed a significant reduction for the broadcasting in the bilateral thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus, left hippocampus, bilateral insula, inferior/middle temporal, right superior temporal, bilateral fusiform and lingual cortices, Figure  , middle column. We furthermore observed a reduced capacity to receive information in the bilateral precuneus, PCC, cuneus, right lingual, calcarine, bilateral middle cingulum and right middle temporal cortices. The comparison between MCS and UWS showed an additional significant reduction for patients with UWS in receiving and broadcasting of information at the left precuneus, occipital cortex, temporal and right superior parietal, Figure  , right column; thus indicating that the information flow in these areas might be the most important contributors to conscious information processing. \n\n\n### Association of whole‐brain network responses to clinical measures \n  \nIn order to better contextualise the data‐driven and the model‐based analyses reported in this study, we also searched for the relation to other aspects of clinical interest. We first evaluated if the whole brain responses (as in Figure  ) are sensitive to etiology alongside the level of consciousness. Main and interaction effects of diagnosis and etiology on the peak value (i.e., early response) and late global brain responses (area‐under‐the‐curve in the 60–200 s of modeled time) were quantified using a linear regression model. We did not find significant differences for peak global responses for diagnosis (  p   = 0.405), etiology (  p   = 0.137), or the interaction between diagnosis and etiology (  p   = 0.258), the model   r  ‐squared = 0.27 and model   p  ‐value = 0.008. For the late global response, we noted significant differences in the case of diagnosis but neither in etiology nor in the interaction between diagnosis and etiology (  p  ‐value for diagnosis = 0.0004,   p  ‐value for etiology = 0.063,   p  ‐value for interaction = 0.096; the model   r  ‐squared = 0.32 and model   p  ‐value = 0.0027). This confirms that the main differences in our analyses are due to diagnosis and ensured that the observed effects were mediated by the level of consciousness primarily, rather than by the effects of etiology. Indeed, looking at the global brain responses of individual subjects, we see that the anoxia and TBI subjects are diversely distributed in both UWS and MCS patient groups, Figure  . As etiology and the interaction between etiology and diagnosis were not significant, we did not explore their relationship with the regional responses further. \n  \nAssociation of the individual whole brain response curves of in‐silico perturbations and clinical variables. (a) Response curves   for individual participants grouped by diagnostic including healthy controls (HC; top), unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS; middle) and minimally conscious state (MCS; bottom) and colored by etiology in the case of DoC patients (Anoxia in orange and non‐Anoxia [e.g., TBI, hemorrhage] in blue). The whole‐brain responses of anoxia and TBI patients are heterogeneously distributed in both UWS and MCS groups. (b) Example for the MIBH images for a representative UWS and MCS patient. As also evident from the boxplot, glucose metabolism is minimal in UWS patients while partially preserved in MCS patients. (c) Correlation of whole brain response to simulated perturbation (  y  ‐axis) with the metabolic index of the best hemisphere (MIBH;   x  ‐axis) and individual data points are color coded according to the patient's CRS‐R total score (left panel). Similarly, correlation of whole brain response to In‐silico perturbation (  y  ‐axis) with the CRS‐R total score (  x  ‐axis) and individual data points are color coded according to the patient's MIBH index (right panel). \n  \nSince neural activity propagation requires the consumption of energy at the neural level, we quantified whole‐brain glucose metabolism (measured via glucose PET imaging) and assessed its relation to the integrative network response (measured as the whole‐brain computational response to perturbation). We first establish that the MIBH of UWS patients was significantly lower (2.53 ± 0.31) as compared to MCS patients (4.57 ± 1.32), (  p   < 0.0001), Figure  . Then, we compared the whole brain glucose PET MIBH values with the whole brain network response of the regions whose perturbation showed significantly altered flow in UWS patients. We noted positive correlations of whole brain network responses with the MIBH (  r   = 0.44,   p   = 0.005; Figure  , left column). To further explore the link of the network response with behavior observable at the bedside, we correlated the functional network response with CRS‐R scores obtained from behavioral evaluation. This also yielded a significant correlation (  r   = 0.39,   p   = 0.013 Figure   right column). \n\nIn summary, our model‐based analyses to estimate effective connectivity and to simulate in‐silico the response to exogenous perturbations can be related to basic biological measures and clinical observations, allowing us to identify specific directed pathways that are disrupted in patients with DoC. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn the present paper, we have studied the neural propagation of endogenous and exogenous perturbations in the brain using model‐free and model‐based analysis methods, applied to the problem of elucidating the mechanisms behind the loss of consciousness due to acquired brain injury and its partial recovery. The methods employed here add significant value to the dynamical approaches for two main reasons. First, they rely on simple observables—the resting‐state fMRI—thus bypassing the need to execute experimental exogenous stimulation protocols, for example, transcranial magnetic stimulation. Second, unlike previous approaches, they allowed us to investigate the directional causal interactions between brain regions, thus elucidating alterations in the broadcasting and the integrating capacities of individual areas or pathways, between normal awake and unconscious patients. Our main finding is that we could identify two distinct malfunctioning neural circuits in patients with DoC: the posterior cortical regions fail to convey information, in conjunction with reduced broadcasting of information from subcortical, temporal, parietal and frontal regions. These results show that patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness lack the capacity for the integration of events that would lead to conscious perception. \n\nIn healthy controls, we found that the relaxation time constants   associated with the resting‐state BOLD signals display a graded spatial distribution with shorter relaxation times in subcortical areas and longer time constants in the frontal and in the parietal areas, Figure  a. Accordingly, analysis of exogenous in‐silico perturbations revealed that the broadcasting of information flow is predominant in a broad range of cognitive modules, including the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal, posterior and inferior frontal regions. This subcortical–cortical loop has been proposed to mediate the sensory information to be globally ‘accessible’ to other cognitive functions through feedforward and feedback loops by the global neuronal workspace theory, and only when access to all cognitive modules occurs, sensory content is elevated to conscious perception (Dehaene et al.,  ; Dehaene & Changeux,  ; Mashour et al.,  ). Although the activity in the posterior regions is highly influenced by perturbations, suggesting that they have a large cause‐effect capacity to receive and integrate the information flow, is one of the key principles of conscious perception in integration information theory (Oizumi et al.,  ; Tononi,  ; Tononi et al.,  ). \n\nRegarding the patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), the results observed were very much altered. First, the propagation of endogenous events occurring in the resting‐state BOLD rapidly decays, avoiding their subsequent integration, Figure  . This is corroborated by the fact that the spatial distribution of relaxation times fades away in the UWS patients, with all areas taking short relaxation times (Figure  ) and evidencing that local activity does not properly propagate along the network. Especially frontal, parietal and higher‐order cortices which ensure sensory information processing, need longer time to integrate diverse information (Hasson et al.,  ; Yeshurun et al.,  ). Second, effective connectivity is reduced overall but interestingly some effective subcortical–cortical connections were found to significantly increase, Figure  . The propagation of in‐silico exogenous perturbations showed a rapid and large initial response quickly followed by a fast decay, Figure  , since the activity fails to propagate throughout the network in a sustained manner. Such early hyper‐response has been previously seen in UWS patients (Di Perri et al.,  ) and in loss of consciousness due to generalized epilepsy possibly caused by excess electrical discharges in the brain (Moeller et al.,  ). The mechanism for this hyper‐response, Figure  , is yet to be fully elucidated but it has been previously reported during loss of consciousness in different scenarios. For example, Kroeger and Amzica ( ) observed hypersensitivity to stimuli (sensory or mechanical) in cats during deep anesthesia. Their results suggested that during the periods of neural inactivity (the down states) both intra‐ and extra‐cellular (e.g., Ca ) concentrations have the time to relax to basal levels allowing the neural tissue to respond the moment a stimulus is applied. Wollstadt et al.,   suggested that such hyper‐response could be due to lack of inhibition within and between subcortical–cortical areas in anesthetized ferrets (Wollstadt et al.,  ). The hyper‐response after stimulation is reminiscent of the empirical stimulation studies in DoC patients too. Activity after transcranial magnetic stimulation in unconsciousness states are characterized by a breakdown of cortical complexity (Casali et al.,  ; Massimini et al.,  ), hypothesized to be the result of low integration or lacking differentiation in neural activity. Such a network‐level interpretation might be relevant for the interpretation of our results as well, and after initial perturbation, a rapid decline in the brain's ability to process and broadcast stimuli is observed. Simply stated, even if the unconscious brain attempts to propagate activity throughout the network, it fails to integrate the input into conscious perception. \n\nThe patients in minimally conscious state (MCS) studied here went through a period of coma and UWS after brain injury, but later regained partial consciousness and cognitive functionalities. All the results found for the MCS patients show moderate alterations to those in the healthy participants, as expected from their partial functional recovery. The spatial gradient of relaxation time constants from the resting‐state BOLD is recovered, Figure  , except shorter time constants were still found in the thalamus and the left medial prefrontal cortex. Effective connectivity was in general slightly below values observed in control subjects but a significant reduction was found remaining in frontoparietal connections and in between temporal regions, Figure  . Regional broadcasting and receiving capacities to in‐silico perturbations displayed a recovered scenario, see Figure   and Table  . It is clinically relevant to understand why or how MCS patients could partially recover from the unresponsive wakefulness state. In the light of our results, it seems that a sufficient regain of the propagation of information leading to an increase in receiving and broadcasting of information at the left precuneus, occipital cortex, temporal and right superior parietal is instrumental for the recovery of conscious information processing, Figure  . \n\nIn comparison with healthy controls, the patients with UWS showed a severe reduction of receiving information in posterior regions, which implies sensory information integration is already impaired at the level of sensory regions to the high‐level hub regions of the Default Mode Network (i.e., PCC and Precuneus). Indeed, the lack of receiving of information in the sensory areas hampers a stimulus or event to reach awareness, as integration of external inputs is a prerequisite for consciousness (Herbet et al.,  ). Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for how the ability to receive information in sensory and DMN hub regions alters cerebral information processing, which might be at the essence for the structural and functional anomalies in UWS. Although it is known that the PCC and the Precuneus have decreased structural, functional and metabolic integrity (Annen et al.,  ; Demertzi et al.,  ; López‐González et al.,  ; Luppi et al.,  ; Stender et al.,  ), our results show that the ability to receive information in sensory and DMN hub regions is reduced in UWS. On the other hand, broadcasting was reduced in the subcortical regions (i.e., thalamus, caudate, putamen) and regions involved in higher cognitive function (i.e., temporo‐parietal, anterior cingulate and frontal regions). This is aligned with the mesocircuit hypothesis (Schiff,  ) which states that the feedforward connections between these regions play a key role in reaching levels of (cortical) activity that support the stimuli to access consciousness processing. This has been recently confirmed in macaques using intracraneal‐EEG, showing that integration at the thalamus, caudate, putamen and parietal cortex is a hallmark of conscious states (Afrasiabi et al.,  ). Our findings unravel that human consciousness also relies on the broadcasting capacities (i.e., from the thalamus, caudate and putamen) to support the transmission of activity, functional integration and recurrent activity between subcortical and cortical neurons, all of which is lost in UWS. Interestingly, we also noted a decrease in receiving and broadcasting capacities in the bilateral temporal areas for DoC patients. Recent studies also noted altered structural (Annen et al.,  ) and functional loss in the temporal area of DoC patients (Demertzi et al.,  ; Thibaut et al.,  ). To date, there is limited explanation for the involvement of the temporal cortex in consciousness. We speculate that a lesser involvement of the temporal areas in the information pathways could impede self‐awareness and memory. \n\nFrom a clinical point of view, there is a variety of causes leading to disorders of consciousness. These are typically classified into two categories. On the one hand,   anoxia   is a generalized damage of brain tissue due to a temporary disruption of oxygen supply caused by, e.g., a heart attack or asphyxia. On the other hand, loss of consciousness can also occur as a result of focal brain lesions, e.g., traumatic brain injury, stroke or epilepsy. It is well‐known that the probability of (partial) recovery from UWS is larger for patients with focal lesions than for anoxic patients (Thibaut et al.,  ). This is reflected in the sample of patients here studied since 11 out of 14 patients with UWS are anoxic and 19 out of 26 patients in MCS suffered from focal brain injuries. However, the extent of damage is not a perfect predictor and the heterogeneity of lesions across patients calls for a better understanding of the mechanistic causes leading to the loss and the (partial) recovery of consciousness. We have explored the effects of etiology in our results and found that the diagnostic classification of the patients into UWS and MCS based on EC and on the propagation of perturbations significantly correlate, while this was not the case for etiology. Even though, at this point, we could not establish a link between etiology and network responses, perhaps due to a lack of data and heterogeneity within the data, hypothetically the evaluation of lesion‐specific alterations in network responses could help formulate more specific predictions about where propagation is significantly altered in reduced conscious states. Other samples including healthy volunteers under sedation could help narrowing down the location of possible consciousness mechanisms further as well. \n\nAdditionally, we have observed that activity propagation leading to consciousness is correlated to the presence of relatively widespread preserved glucose metabolism (Figure  ). This widespread preserved glucose metabolic rate is associated to the richness of signs of consciousness at the behavioral level, as commonly reported in the literature (Annen et al.,  ; Stender et al.,  ; Thibaut et al.,  ). The association of the complex model‐based assessment of network function to empirically measured brain metabolism and behavioral profiles in the first place suggests that the model is biologically relevant. Second, although a causal relation cannot be established to date, it is a first step towards the exploration of a potential mechanism behind the widespread altered glucose metabolism in DoC patients. However, the causal relationship between regional glucose metabolism and their broadcasting/receiving properties is still to be clarified. On the one hand, we could speculate that a significant disruption of the propagation of events along the neural network leads to a loss of metabolic demand, which is then observed via glucose PET. But, on the other hand, the opposite possibility also needs to be considered that the brain lesions could disrupt the metabolic supply chains, thus exhausting the capacity of the neural network to generate sufficient activity and responses. To be noted, both BOLD and FDG‐PET are related to metabolism and neural function, and a relationship between the two is to be expected. However, the latter is a more direct measure of metabolism. Another relevant difference is that the timescales of both the modalities are very different, which allows for a complementary interpretation of the findings. FDG‐PET presents the cumulative metabolism of gray matter at rest and is possibly related to the capacity for consciousness in an individual. We believe, the BOLD response after perturbation gives an indication of the state specific potential activity of specific brain areas (Bodart et al.,  ). Hence, the current assessment of activity propagation could be used to monitor patient's progress over time or in response to therapy. \n\nOur in‐silico pertubational study revealed transient global changes to the propagation of activity, associated to glucose metabolism, that are similar to those we observed from the integration of endogenous events with the intrinsic ignition. In DoC patients, and especially for those with UWS, the brain's cause‐effect capacity to respond is significantly lower than during normal wakefulness in healthy subjects. It seems that the observed spatiotemporal alterations of local event processing also hamper global integration and whole brain neural responses; as observed both after in‐silico and endogenous perturbations. These results are in line with a number of empirical observations showing that during loss of consciousness due to sleep, anesthesia or brain damage, external natural (artificial perturbations) trigger normal neural responses in the area primary sensory cortices (in the area of application) but this initial activity fails to adequately propagate further impeding conscious integration and perception of the stimuli at higher cognitive levels (Arena et al.,  ; Casali et al.,  ; Ishizawa et al.,  ; Krom et al.,  ; Massimini et al.,  ; Pavone et al.,  ; Portas et al.,  ; Sela et al.,  ). In conclusion, the cerebral capacity of propagation and integration of local, naturally occurring events into the entire network is affected by reduced states of consciousness and shares similarities with both information integration theory (Tononi,  ; Tononi et al.,  ) and global neuronal workspace theory (Dehaene et al.,  ; Mashour et al.,  ). Although these theories have distinct concepts of consciousness (Northoff et al.,  ; Northoff & Lamme,  ; Winters,  ), our results suggest that they might represent two sides of the same coin. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nRajanikant Panda, Ane López‐González, Jitka Annen, Gorka Zamora‐López, Matthieu Gilson, Gustavo Deco and Steven Laureys designed research.

Additionally, compared with the HC group, the left habenula showed decreased dFC with the bilateral cuneus gyrus and bilateral calcarine gyrus in the SCH group. The PANSS negative sub-scores were positively correlated with the sFC values of the bilateral habenula with the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and angular gyrus. The PANSS general sub-scores were positively correlated with the sFC values of the right habenula with the left middle temporal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus. The hallucination scores of PANSS were negatively correlated with the sFC values of the left habenula with the bilateral cuneus gyrus and bilateral calcarine gyrus; The anxiety scores of PANSS were positively correlated with the dFC values of the left habenula with the right temporal pole. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis study provides evidence that the habenula of the first-episode schizophrenia patients presented abnormal static functional connectivity with temporal lobe and angular gyrus, and additionally showed weakened stability of functional connectivity in occipital lobe. This abnormality is closely related to the symptoms of hallucination and anxiety in schizophrenia, which may indicate that the habenula involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia by affecting the dopamine pathway. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nSchizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder caused by brain dysfunction under the influence of biological, psychological and social environmental factors, which lead to different levels of obstacles in cognitive, emotional, volition and behavior and other mental activities, seriously threatening human health and quality of life, and causing huge burden to families and society ( ). The clinical symptoms of schizophrenia are extremely knotty and vary greatly among individuals, including positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions and mental disorders), negative symptoms (apathy, poverty of thought and spontaneous speech) and cognitive dysfunction ( ). \n\nSchizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder of unknown etiology. Researchers have been exposing the pathogenesis of schizophrenia from many aspects including genetics, neuroanatomy, neurobiochemistry, neurodevelopment, neuropathology, neuropsychology and so on. In neurobiochemical researches of schizophrenia, dopamine has recently garnered the most attention among the monoamine neurotransmitters, as studies in the past have demonstrated that its malfunction plays a significant part in the development of schizophrenia ( ,  ). Dopamine is one of the important neurotransmitters that transmit information between brain neurons. It is produced by the ventral tegmentum and substantia nigra of the midbrain and can act on the prefrontal lobe, nucleus accumbens and striatum. It is believed that the dysfunction of dopaminergic neurotransmitter leads to the appearance of symptoms of schizophrenia ( ). Patients with schizophrenia typically experience abnormalities in the frontal cortex’s dopamine D1 receptor hypofunction and the subcortical structure’s dopamine D2 receptor hyperfunction. Three crucial components in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia involving the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and the ventral tegmentum of the midbrain form three important neural circuits, namely, midbrain-limbic dopamine circuit, midbrain-cortex dopamine circuit and cortex-limbic glutamate circuit-γ-aminobutyric acid circuit ( ). Whether the antipsychotic drugs are effective for schizophrenia is closely related to their affinity with dopamine D2 receptors, and researchers have widely accepted the “hyper dopamine hypothesis” according to extensive research bases. According to previous research, dopamine hypofunction in the prefrontal lobe is linked to negative symptoms like apathy and cognitive decline while dopamine hyperfunction in subcortical areas is linked to positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions ( ). Therefore, considering the key influence of dopamine dysfunction in the development of schizophrenia, to comprehend the pathophysiology of schizophrenia better, it is crucial to investigate the brain regions that control the midbrain dopamine system. \n\nThe habenula is a pair of small nuclei in the middle and posterior part of the dorsal thalamus, which is segmented into medial habenula (MHb) and lateral habenula (LHb) histologically. It is a relay station connecting the limbic system, the frontal lobe, the basal ganglia and the monoaminergic nuclei in the midbrain, relating to learning, reproduction, stress and anxiety reactions, pain, and reward ( ). Studies have shown that dysfunction of habenula can lead to a variety of mental diseases, such as schizophrenia and depression ( ,  ). The habenula, as an important node in the dopamine reward circuit and its role in mental diseases, as well as its biological function in regulating dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), has attracted extensive attention in recent years. The habenula gradually emerged as a new hotspot in the field of psychiatric research. In February, Cui et al. and Yang et al. published two research articles in Nature, which revealed the close relationship between depression and habenula, and was regarded as a major breakthrough in the study of mental diseases ( ,  ). In terms of schizophrenia, numerous studies on animal have found that the functional disturbance of habenula is closely related to schizophrenia, but few studies of habenula in schizophrenia patients have been reported. A research on rats found that the decrease of attention, cognitive ability and social behavior activity after LHb damage was very similar to the symptoms of schizophrenia, and distraction could also cause the decline of learning and memory ability of rats, indicating that poor habenula function may act a crucial part in cognitive dysfunction of schizophrenia ( ). Shepard et al. ( ) believed that habenula dysfunction would limit the ability to learn from mistakes, which is one of the most typical cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Studies on schizophrenia patients have found that the decrease in the volume, frequent calcification and hypometabolic state of habenula imply that the activity of habenula may be diminished in schizophrenia, which may cause the emergence of schizophrenia-like symptoms through increasing the midbrain dopaminergic activity ( ). \n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be employed to detect resting and task states changes of brain regions in schizophrenia patients. Several studies have confirmed that schizophrenia patients show abnormal functional activities of brain regions at rest ( ,  ). Functional connectivity is a basic indicator of brain network changes in patients with mental disorders, which can reveal additional information regarding brain function. So far, most functional connectivity (FC) studies on schizophrenia focus on static functional connectivity (sFC), and it reflects the statistical correlation of time series among various areas and supposes that the FC between regions is static across time ( ,  ). In recent years, progressively more scholars believe that FC in resting state is dynamic, showing significant spontaneous fluctuations over a small time scale ( – ). Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), a supplementary technique, can describe the dynamic properties of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal variations in the time scale. A fixed length time window is chosen for the dFC method and used to calculate FC metrics. After a predetermined duration, the window slides to the next time window, resulting in several FC metrics that can clarify the time characteristics of FC over the entire scan duration. The dFC method can accurately describe the cooperation of brain regions by calculating the time-varying covariance of bold signals between regions. In other words, the higher the dFC value, the more unstable the FC. The instability of FC may reveal the neural mechanism of diverse diseases, numerous studies have reported that the FC window states of healthy controls were observed to switch more frequently, indicating that patients with disorders such as schizophrenia and depression tend to linger in a state of “weak” and relatively “rigid” connectivity with a decreased dFC, while healthy controls dynamically switch between different FC states. Such a finding was not detectable using a static FC approach, and underscores the importance of evaluating dynamic changes in connectivity. Yet the relationship between more unstable FC with better or worse symptomatology still need further discussion. Therefore, the functional connectivity between different brain regions changes with time, and dFC reflects the variation of functional connectivity on the time scale, which can explain the stability of brain activity more deeply and contribute to clarify the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Consequently, combining sFC and dFC methods to analyze the brain functional images of schizophrenia patients can better explain its neural mechanisms. However, there are few studies on habenula activity in schizophrenia patients. Shepard et al. found that the habenula regulates dopamine neurons and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia in their study ( ) and Zhang et al. also found that schizophrenia patients presented abnormal volume and functional connectivity compared with healthy controls ( ). However, none of these studies has discovered the dynamic functional connectivity of the habenula. So, it is unclear whether and how the habenula function is altered in schizophrenia patients, and there is no study on dFC of habenula in schizophrenia patients. \n\nThe current study’s objective was to explore the sFC and dFC of habenula in schizophrenia patients, comprehensively explore the role of habenula in the pathophysiological changes of schizophrenia, search for the biological markers of the disease from the perspective of brain function, and provide clues and basis for the clinical diagnosis and evaluation of schizophrenia. This study collected rs-fMRI data from first-episode and drug- naïve schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. First, we studied the voxel-wise sFC and dFC of bilateral habenula with the whole brain in two groups; Additionally, we conducted the correlation analysis of altered sFC and dFC values with symptom index in schizophrenia (SCH) group. We hypothesized that SCH may show altered sFC and dynamic FC fluctuations of habenula throughout the scanning compared with the healthy controls (HC) group, which made it possible to substantially discover the neuromechanism of schizophrenia. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nWe recruited 198 first-episode drug-naïve schizophrenia patients and 199 healthy controls, and all participants are Chinese Han and right-handed. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), schizophrenia was diagnosed by two professional clinical psychiatrists. The schizophrenia patients included in this study were recruited from the psychiatry department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, and never received treatment and psychological counseling before, with the first symptom of which (disease’s duration) occurs less than 3 years. According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria and the definition of “first episode” by Breitborde et al. and Keshavan and Schooler ( ,  ), it is reasonable to infer that drug-naïve patients with a course of less than 3 years can be regarded as a group of first-episode schizophrenia included in this study, yet the possibility cannot be ruled out that some of the included patients were not first episode. Two trained researchers assessed the patients with questionnaires and assessed their symptoms with the Positive and Negative Symptom Scales (PANSS). \n\nThe present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. The exclusion criteria for this study are as follows: (1) The head has suffered from trauma or severe organic disease; (2) Drug or alcohol abuse; (3) Organic mental disease; (4) Pregnancy; and (5) MRI contraindication. For HC group, nervous system disease or mental illness, as well as family history of mental illness will be excluded. After clarifying the study, all participants were asked to sign the informed consent sheet. \n\n\n### 2.2. Data acquisition \n  \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired by 3.0 T MRI scanner (Discovery MR750, GE, USA) with an 8-channel head coil. All subjects were asked to lie quietly with their eyes closed, stay awake and relaxed, foam pads and rubber earplugs being used to reduce head movement and strepitous interference. \n\nA 3D-T1 BRAVO sequence was applied to obtain high-resolution structural images with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 8.2/3.2 ms, slices = 188, slice thickness = 1 mm, slice gap = 0 mm, flip angle (FA) = 12°, field of view (FOV) = 25.6 × 25.6 cm , number of averages = 1, data matrix = 256 × 256, voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm , scan time = 4.33 min. The functional images were obtained using a gradient spin echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence: TR/TE = 2000/30 ms, slices = 32, slice thickness = 4 mm, slice gap = 0.5 mm, FA = 90°, field of view (FOV) = 22 × 22 cm , number of averages = 1, data matrix = 64 × 64, voxel size = 3.4375 × 3.4375 × 4 mm , and 180 volumes lasting for 360 s. \n\n\n### 2.3. Data preprocessing \n  \nBased on MATLAB (MathWorks) platform, DPABI toolbox  was used to preprocess rs-fMRI data. To allow magnetic saturation, the first five volumes of data were thrown away. Next, additional preprocessing was conducted with the following procedures: (1) slice timing; (2) realignment, subjects with maximum head motion exceeding 3 mm or a 3° rotation will be removed for purpose of head motion rectification; (3) normalization (DARTEL method), the unified structural images segmentation information were used to register individual functional images to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate space, resampling to 3 × 3 × 3 mm ; (4) detrending; (5) temporal band-pass filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz); and (6) nuisance covariates regression of white matter, cerebrospinal fluid and head movement profile (Friston-24). \n\n\n### 2.4. Definition of region of interest \n  \nTwo regions of interest (ROIs) were selected to conduct sFC and dFC analysis, including left habenula and right habenula. The bilateral habenula mask was downloaded on the website of Automated Human Habenula Segmentation Program  according to a previously calculated functional magnetic resonance imaging study ( ). \n\n\n### 2.5. Static FC analyses \n  \nThe Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI Advanced Edition (DPARSFA) software package in DPABI software is used for sFC analysis. The BOLD time series of the left and right habenula was extracted respectively, then the Pearson correlation coefficients with the whole brain’s time series were measured, and finally the Fisher Z transformation values were used for subsequent statistical analysis. \n\n\n### 2.6. Dynamic FC analyses \n  \nThe Temporary Dynamic Analysis software package in DPABI software is used for dFC analysis with the sliding window method ( ), which was employed to form dFC maps for each subject. According to the recommendations on dFC in previous researches ( ), in order to optimize the balance between the characteristics of rapid functional status changes and the stable connectivity among brain regions, the appropriate length for obtaining dynamic FC state is 30 seconds to 1 minute using the Hamming window method ( ). Finally, the window length is set to 30 TR (60s) and the sliding step length is 1 TR. In each window, Pearson correlation coefficients of the whole brain’s time series were measured were calculated, generating FC maps of left and right habenula of each window, and then Fisher Z transformation was performed to generate zFC maps. The standard deviation of zFC value of each window is the dFC value. \n\n\n### 2.7. Statistical analysis \n  \nStatistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0 software was employed for statistical processing of general demographic and clinical data, which were represented in the form of mean ± standard deviation. The difference of age and education level between the SCH group and the HC group was compared by two sample t-test, and the difference of gender was compared by chi-square test. Statistical significance was all determined by   p   < 0.05. \n\nThe fMRI data were statistically analyzed using the DPABI software package. The sFC and dFC values of bilateral habenula with the whole brain in SCH group and HC group were compared by two sample   t  -test and corrected by gaussian random field (GRF), with age, gender, years of education, and head motion (mean FD) as covariates. The GRF method for multiple comparison correction (voxel-wise   p   < 0.005, cluster-wise   p   < 0.05) was applied. \n\nThe sFC and dFC values of statistically significant clusters were generated individually. Then, in the SPSS software, Spearman’s correlation analysis was utilized to explore the correlation of extracted sFC value/dFC value with the PANSS scores by Bonferroni correction (  p   < 0.05). \n\n\n### 2.8. Validation analysis \n  \nGiven the small size of habenula, to remove the distortions and signal loss of rs-fMRI signals influenced by the magnetic field inhomogeneity at air-tissue interfaces, we use the Temporal Signal to Noise Ratio (tSNR) based on BRANT (BrainNetome Toolkit)  ( ), which is calculated as the average intensity of time series divided by the standard deviation, to generate subject-level whole-brain mask to exclude spurious voxels, then we extracted the tSNR of left and right habenula seeds, and two adjacent but not overlapping cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) seeds (sphere with a radius of 3 mm). Finally, a contrast between the tSNR of bilateral habenula with adjacent CSF seeds was performed. \n\nIn order to verify the repeatability of dFC results, in addition to 30 TR, we also performed verification tests on sliding window lengths of 50 and 60 TR according to the suggestion by Liao et al. ( ), and the dFC maps for the left and right habenula were reconstructed separately. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1.

Spearman correlational analysis \n  \nPANSS negative sub-scores were positively correlated with the sFC values of cluster 1 using the left habenula seed in SCH group (  r   = 0.152,   p   = 0.020). PANSS negative sub-scores were positively correlated with the sFC values of cluster 1 using the right habenula seed in SCH group (  r   = 0.153,   p   = 0.048). PANSS general sub-scores were positively correlated with the sFC values of cluster 1 using the right habenula seed in SCH group (  r   = 0.151,   p   = 0.034). PANSS total scores were positively correlated with the sFC values of cluster 1 using the left habenula seed in SCH group (  r   = 0.144,   p   = 0.043). PANSS total scores were positively correlated with the sFC values of cluster 1 using the right habenula seed in SCH group (  r   = 0.161,   p   = 0.024) (see  ). The scores of P2 (hallucination) were negatively correlated with the sFC of cluster 3 using the left habenula seed in SCH group (  r   = –0.226,   p   = 0.019). The scores of G3 (anxiety) were positively correlated with the dFC of cluster 1 using the left habenula seed in SCH group (  r   = 0.212,   p   = 0.008). \n  \nCorrelations between abnormal sFC, dFC, values and clinical variables.

The sliding window lengths of 50 and 60 TRs generated findings that were comparable to what we discovered for the 30 TR. The findings of every validation analysis were posted as  ,  . \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn our study, we applied the bilateral habenula as seeds to compare the whole brain’s sFC and dFC maps of the first-episode, drug-naïve schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, both left and right habenula were observed increased sFC in SCH group, while left habenula was observed decreased dFC in SCH group. With regard to sFC, the SCH group showed a significant increase in sFC of left habenula with right middle temporal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, right temporal pole, left middle temporal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus compared with HC group; In SCH group, the sFC of right habenula with left middle temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus and left angular gyrus was significantly increased. The dFC of left habenula with bilateral cuneus gyrus and bilateral calcarine gyrus was significantly decreased in SCH group compared with HC group. In addition, our study discovered that the sFC values of statistically significant brain regions with left habenula as seed (right middle temporal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus) were positively correlated with the negative scores and total scores of PANSS, and sFC values of statistically significant brain regions with right habenula as seed (left middle temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left angular gyrus) were positively correlated with the negative scores, general scores and total scores of PANSS. The sFC and dFC values of habenula were negatively correlated with P3 (hallucination) and positively correlated with G2 (anxiety) of PANSS. In conclusion, these results indicate that several brain regions presented abnormal static and dynamic FC with bilateral habenula in schizophrenia patients, including the middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, temporal pole, angular gyrus, bilateral cuneus gyrus, and bilateral calcarine gyrus, which act a crucial part in the mechanism of schizophrenia. \n\nDopamine transmission disorder is an important feature of schizophrenia, and several studies have found that psychiatric symptoms may be driven by hyperdopaminergic state and increased temporal activity in subcortical regions ( ,  ). Despite its diminutive size, the habenula was focused by a growing number of psychiatric studies. The habenula mediates the transmission of negative feedback information between dopamine-rich brain regions in the limbic forebrain and dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain structure, as a result of which it can produce a self-rewarding effect, which is thought to act an important part in the pathophysiological process of affective disorders ( ,  ). The malfunction of habenula may bring out SCH-like symptoms by mistakenly inhibiting mesencephalon dopaminergic activity ( ). Neuroimaging studies have confirmed that the interactions between brain regions in schizophrenia patients have altered ( ,  ). Several scholars put forward the theory of “prefrontal-striatum-substantia nigra circuit”, and believed that the damage of this circuit was related to the pathogenesis of mental and cognitive disorder in schizophrenia. The habenula mainly receives information from the “frontal-limbic system-basal ganglia circuit” and the efferent pathway to the midbrain, suggesting that the habenula may be an important hub structure in the forebrain limbic system, striatum and substantia nigra dopamine control system, and a key node connecting the limbic system and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, which could have a crucial impact on how schizophrenia develops ( ). \n\nNumerous studies have proved that the structural and functional alteration of prefrontal lobe, temporal lobe, basal ganglia, midbrain and other brain regions are related to the occurrence and development of schizophrenia ( ), and inseparable fiber and functional connection between the habenula with these regions exists ( ). Up to now, only a tiny minority have studied the abnormal FC of habenula in schizophrenia. Zhang et al. reported that the FC of the left habenula with the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), left lingual gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in patients with SCH has increased, and the FC of the right habenula with the left ventral striatum, caudate and putamen has increased ( ). In our study, the SCH group presented several regions which exist abnormal sFC with left and right habenula. The results showed that the sFC of left habenula with bilateral middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and right temporal pole increased, and the sFC of the right habenula with the left middle temporal gyrus, the left superior temporal gyrus, and the left angular gyrus increased, indicating that the habenula may play a role in the pathological changes associated with schizophrenia. Extensive research about schizophrenia have discovered defects in the structure, activation and functional connectivity of the temporal lobe, and several studies have also suggested that temporal lobe dysfunction may be involved in mediating the loss of dopaminergic neuron activity, the enhancement of subcortical dopaminergic nerve conduction and psychosis. Serge et al. reported that the dyslexia of schizophrenia patients is related to the abnormality of dopamine receptors in the middle temporal gyrus, and confirmed that the dopamine receptors in the middle temporal gyrus act an important part in the pathogenesis of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia ( ). Mirjam et al. and Monte et al. respectively reported that schizophrenia patients have decreased dopamine D2/D3 receptor binding in the temporal cortex in their PET studies ( ,  ). Benedetta et al. study on the resting state network (RSN) of schizophrenia found that the signal transduction of dopamine and 5-HT may be correlated with the FC alteration of RSN such as sensorimotor network (SMN), salience network (SN), and default-mode network (DMN), involving the temporal lobe ( ). For the temporal cortex in the auditory system, a mouse model study by Chun et al. found a neuronal mechanism to link the dopamine dysfunction with the generation of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia ( ). Our study also found an increase in functional connectivity of the right habenula with the left angular gyrus. Numerous cognitive processes, including visual communication, visual spatial attention, memory semantics, and social cognition, are mediated by the angular gyrus ( – ). Many previous studies have shown that the angular gyrus, as a part of the default network, showed destroyed structural and functional coupling in schizophrenia patients. Gao et al. utilized methods of rs-FC and granger causality analysis (GCA) to study the internal and causal alteration of habenula in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients after electroconvulsive therapy, and it was found that the functional connectivity between the habenula and the left angular gyrus was increased, and it is concluded that the functional and causal relationship between left angular gyrus and bilateral habenula can be used as a biomarker to distinguish MDD and HC ( ). To sum up, we identified aberrant functional connectivity between the habenula and the temporal lobe, angular gyrus in our investigation, which added new evidence for the habenula’s critical role in the neuropathology of schizophrenia. The habenula may affect dopamine information transmission through the altered FC of the habenula with the middle temporal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus, and the angular gyrus, thus leading to the occurrence of symptoms in schizophrenia patients. \n\nThe conventional sFC displays the average connectivity degree between regions, while the dFC shows the potential neuro-endophenotype of schizophrenia, which can better mirror the time-varying nature of internal activity and connectivity, thus revealing the special connectivity patterns that are often lost in sFC analysis. Up to now, a growing number of studies have found that schizophrenia appears dFC alteration in multiple brain regions ( ,  ). In this study, the dFC results were different from sFC, and abnormal dFC of significantly abnormal sFC regions with the habenula was absent. In contrast to the HC group, the dFC of the habenula with bilateral cuneus gyrus, calcarine gyrus was significantly reduced in the SCH group, suggesting that the stability of FC of the habenula with the occipital lobe weakened. The cuneus and calcarine gyrus belong to the occipital lobe anatomically, and the occipital lobe is primarily responsible for the prevalence of visual hallucinations in schizophrenia, according to earlier research ( ). Li et al. found the altered dFC between the lateral occipital cortex and multiple networks in first-episode schizophrenia patients by using dynamic functional connectivity methods, suggesting that the decreased FC stability of the lateral occipital cortex contributes to the emergence of schizophrenia ( ). Bai et al. found that the dopamine receptor-interacting protein in the prefrontal and occipital lobes of schizophrenia were up-regulated, which was related to the abnormal dopamine pathway in schizophrenia ( ). In a word, our results may indicate that the FC frequency of left habenula with bilateral cuneus gyrus, calcarine gyrus decreases over time, which may be crucial in the etiology of schizophrenia by affecting the dopamine pathway. \n\nOur study also found that the abnormal sFC of habenula was positively correlated with the negative scores, the general scores and the total scores of PANSS. In terms of symptom scores in PANSS, the sFC and dFC values of habenula were negatively correlated with P3 (hallucinatory) and positively correlated with G2 (anxiety). It is worth mentioning that the correlations of PANSS scores with FC were, despite being significant, rather weak in effect-size. Several studies have found that habenula may play a key role in regulating feedback processing defects of schizophrenia through affecting dopamine pathway ( ). Abi-Dargham et al. reviewed several studies and discovered that dopamine dysfunction can help explain the positive symptoms experienced by schizophrenia patients ( ). Li et al. observed that decreased activity of the lateral habenula may lead to negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia by downregulating the expression of dopamine receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex in their research on rats ( ). Stopper et al. reported that the abnormal dopamine transmission in the habenula may mediate the defects in positive and negative feedback guidance decision-making in schizophrenia patients ( ). Our research observed that the decreased sFC between the left habenula and occipital lobe is negatively related to the symptom of hallucination, indicating that the weakened stability of the functional connectivity of the habenula may be the cause of hallucination, while the increased dFC between the left habenula and the left temporal pole which is positively correlated with anxiety indicate that the habenula is strongly linked to the symptom of anxiety in schizophrenia, implying that unstable FC is related to more serious symptom of anxiety. Yet, the absence of this situation of the right habenula may reveal the asymmetry of the habenula’s function, and the abnormal functional connectivity of the left habenula acts a critical role in the occurrence of symptoms in schizophrenia. \n\nThere are several limitations in this study that need to be addressed. First of all, we recognize that the habenula is a small structure, and there is a risk of signal leakage from surrounding structures with limited resolution. A more accurate method of segmenting the region is to calculate the exact volume of each subject’s left and right habenula. In the future, a specific habenular nucleus mask based on anatomical manual segmentation and a fMRI of high resolution should be employed. Secondly, this study is a horizontal study of pre-medication schizophrenia patients. In the future, it is necessary to infer whether the abnormal functional connectivity of habenula improves after intervention from the longitudinal study. Third, due to the limitation of imaging resolution, our study did not segment the habenula into medial and lateral part which play an important role in 5-HT and dopamine pathways respectively. In the future, high-resolution imaging is required to separate the medial and lateral habenula, so as to comprehend the respective mechanisms of lateral and medial habenula for mental diseases. Last, we did not evaluate the cognitive function in schizophrenia patients, therefore it is difficult to predict the influence of habenula on the cognitive function of schizophrenia. Therefore, our research is still superficial, in the future, we need to further detailed study about the habenula in schizophrenia, so as to find out the role played by structural and functional abnormalities of habenula in schizophrenia. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nOur study utilized sFC and dFC analysis to examine the aberrant functional connectivity of the habenula with the entire brain regions of first-episode schizophrenia. Additionally, we conduct the correlation analysis of sFC and dFC values with PANSS scores. Our findings revealed that in schizophrenia patients, the sFC between the habenula and the middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, temporal pole, angular gyrus is enhanced, while the dFC of the habenula with bilateral cuneus gyrus, calcarine gyrus is weakened. Moreover, the alterations of FC are closly associated with the symptoms of hallucination and anxiety in schizophrenia patients. To sum up, the current research results showed that the habenula of schizophrenia patients presents abnormal static and dynamic functional connectivity with multiple brain regions, which may lead to the symptoms of schizophrenia by affecting the dopamine pathway and provide a new neural mechanism. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in this study are included in this article/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University.

One complication in the analysis and interpretation of rs-fMRI data is the existence of non-neuronal low frequency physiological noise (systemic low frequency oscillations; sLFOs) which occurs within the same low frequency band as the signal used to compute functional connectivity. Here, we demonstrate the use of a time lag mapping technique to estimate and mitigate the effects of the sLFO signal on resting state functional connectivity of awake squirrel monkeys. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nTwelve squirrel monkeys (6 male/6 female) were acclimated to awake scanning procedures; whole-brain fMRI images were acquired with a 9.4 Tesla scanner. Rs-fMRI data was preprocessed using an in-house pipeline and sLFOs were detected using a seed regressor generated by averaging BOLD signal across all voxels in the brain, which was then refined recursively within a time window of −16–12 s. The refined regressor was then used to estimate the voxel-wise sLFOs; these regressors were subsequently included in the general linear model to remove these moving hemodynamic components from the rs-fMRI data using general linear model filtering. Group level independent component analysis (ICA) with dual regression was used to detect resting-state networks and compare networks before and after sLFO denoising. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nResults show sLFOs constitute ~64% of the low frequency fMRI signal in squirrel monkey gray matter; they arrive earlier in regions in proximity to the middle cerebral arteries (e.g., somatosensory cortex) and later in regions close to draining vessels (e.g., cerebellum). Dual regression results showed that the physiological noise was significantly reduced after removing sLFOs and the extent of reduction was determined by the brain region contained in the resting-state network. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThese results highlight the need to estimate and remove sLFOs from fMRI data before further analysis. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nBlood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), which measures spontaneous low-frequency hemodynamic fluctuations in the brain during rest, is widely used to investigate functional organization of the brain. Because neuronal activity causes local changes in BOLD fMRI signal intensity, the temporal correlation of rs-fMRI signal fluctuations between brain regions is used to infer functional connectivity, i.e., neuronal communication between different regions, which can provide insight into large-scale functional dynamics of the brain (Friston,  ; Biswal et al.,  ; Biswal,  ). Two common approaches to determine functional connectivity are seed-based correlation mapping and independent component analysis (ICA; see Cole et al.,  ; Smitha et al.,  ). Through these methods, several distinct patterns of hemodynamic temporal coherence within different regions across the brain have been identified as resting-state networks (RSNs) (Biswal et al.,  ; Beckmann et al.,  ) and are thought to indicate synchronized neuronal activities within specific networks. These patterns have been extensively examined to understand the functional connectivity of each network, its relation to various behavioral, sensory, and cognitive processes, and how it may be altered during the progression of various disease states or in response to various stimuli. \n\nOne complication in the analysis and interpretation of rs-fMRI data is the existence of non-neuronal low frequency physiological noise. Previous studies have provided compelling evidence that systemic low frequency oscillations (sLFOs) constitute a significant fraction of the rs-fMRI signal in humans (i.e, 30–50% of the low frequency variance in gray matter (Tong and Frederick,  ; Tong et al.,  ; Erdogan et al.,  ). Many attempts have been made to detect and limit the impact of low frequency physiological components on rs-fMRI data. For example, Birn et al. modeled respiration-induced low frequency oscillations (LFOs) from respiratory belt recordings and demonstrated their contribution to the default mode network (Birn et al.,  ,  ). More recently, Tong et al. measured sLFOs in the periphery using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and showed high correlation between sLFOs and several RSNs (Tong et al.,  ). Moreover, these results demonstrated good correspondence between the sLFO signal and rs-fMRI data throughout the brain, with a pattern of time delays suggesting that the sLFO signal was related to vascular anatomy (Tong and Frederick,  ; Tong et al.,  ,  ; Erdogan et al.,  ). This idea is further strengthened by the observation that such sLFO signals propagate within both the cerebral vasculature and throughout the body and have spatiotemporal patterns that reflect dynamic blood flow in the brain (Tong and Frederick,  ; Erdogan et al.,  ; Tong et al.,  ). \n\nThe sLFO signal poses a problem for the interpretation of rs-fMRI data, as it occurs within the same low frequency band as the signal used to compute functional connectivity (i.e., 0.01–0.15 Hz). To address this problem, we have employed a time lag mapping methodology (Erdogan et al.,  ) by which the sLFO component of the brain's BOLD signal can be tracked in the absence of systemic recordings. Such a procedure provides a means to estimate the sLFO signal from the BOLD data itself, determine the voxel-specific time delay of the sLFO signal, quantify its contribution to the rs-fMRI signal, and remove it, mitigating its effect on the evaluation of RSNs. Further, since sLFOs travel with blood, the time when sLFOs reach each voxel can be interpreted as relative blood arrival time, yielding significant insight into cerebral hemodynamics (Tong et al.,  ,  ). \n\nThe present study sought to demonstrate the implementation of this technique to estimate and mitigate the effects of the sLFO signal on the resting state networks of awake squirrel monkeys at ultra-high field (9.4 Tesla). Recently, Aso et al. reported a pattern of sLFOs in rs-fMRI data from rhesus monkeys that was similar to that shown in humans (Aso et al.,  ) suggesting that such procedures may help to decrease contamination of RSNs by non-neuronal sources across various species. The present study extends these findings in two important ways. First, we demonstrate that the contamination of resting state neuronal activation data by moving sLFO signals is seen even in small primates (this is the first study of this type in squirrel monkeys). Second, and perhaps more importantly, we demonstrate that unlike in human data, the sLFO signal is by far the largest source of low frequency variance in the fMRI data (over 60% in much of the gray matter, as much as double the contribution from neuronal activation). Therefore, though performing low frequency signal regression (either global signal regression or our time delayed method) is still a matter of debate and considered “optional” in human data; here we establish that it is essential in squirrel monkeys and, possibly, other animal species. Our findings are of clear translational value as many of the core RSNs that have been identified in humans (Smith et al.,  ,  ) also have been identified in laboratory animal species including non-human primates (NHPs; Hutchison et al.,  ; Belcher et al.,  ; Yacoub et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ) and rodents (Jonckers et al.,  ; Lu et al.,  ). \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Subjects \n  \nTwelve experimentally naïve adolescent (~2.5 years of age) male and female squirrel monkeys (6 male; 6 female) (  Saimiri sciureus  ) served as subjects. Subjects were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled vivarium with a 12-h light/dark cycle (0700–1900). Monkeys had unlimited access to water in the home cage and were maintained at approximate free-feeding weights with a nutritionally balanced diet of high protein chow (Purina Monkey Chow, St. Louis, MO). Fresh fruit and vitamins were provided as part of our environmental enrichment plan. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at McLean Hospital in a facility licensed by the US Department of Agriculture in accordance with guidelines provided by the Committee on Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Institute of Laboratory Animals Resources, Commission on Life Sciences. \n\n\n### 2.2. Awake MRI training and acclimation \n  \nExtensive behavioral training was used to acclimate subjects to the MR procedures. Acclimation sessions, in which operant shaping techniques involving milk reinforcement were used to train subjects to move from the home-cage into a custom-designed MR-compatible chair, were typically conducted 5 days per week. Initially, subjects were trained to sit on their haunches in the prone position within the chair enclosure for brief, 5–10 min, sessions. This duration was gradually increased over several sessions to 30 min, after which, a helmet was introduced. The helmet was designed based on squirrel monkey anatomic images collected on our 9.4 Tesla Agilent/Varian MR system, 3-D printed (Silva et al.,  ), and lined with padding to limit motion and increase comfort for the subjects. The helmet, which also included a platform to position a transmit/receive surface coil, was mounted to the chair body with plastic screws. Once subjects were acclimated to the helmet, the session duration was further increased to 60 min. The final phase of acclimation involved moving subjects into a mock MRI bore housed within the laboratory. During mock scan sessions, recorded sounds from the scanner were played at decibels similar to those within the actual scanner (~90–100 dB). Vital signs (e.g., heart rate and oxygen saturation (SPO2); Nonin Model 7500FO, Plymouth, MN) were tracked and recorded at 5-min intervals throughout both training and actual MR sessions and subjects were continuously monitored through live video-feeds by a trained research assistant (VID-CAM-MONO-1 with SOF-842; Med-Associates, St. Albans, VT) (12M camera; MRC systems GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). \n\n\n### 2.3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \n  \nMRI scans were acquired using a 9.4 Tesla horizontal bore magnet system (Varian Direct Drive, Varian Inc, Palo Alto, CA, USA) running VnmrJ software (version 3.2A). An 11.6 cm inner diameter gradient was used for the present studies with maximum gradient strength of 40 G/cm and a transmit/receive surface coil was used for data collection. Following image localization and manual shimming, whole-brain gradient-echo EPI data were acquired at an isotropic resolution of 1.0 mm with a repetition rate of 1.5 s and echo time of 15 ms over a 30 min session. The fMRI sequence was run for 5 min without data capture prior to the acquisition to allow the gradients to come to thermal equilibrium and minimize artifactual drift. \n\n\n### 2.4. MRI data processing \n  \nfMRI preprocessing was conducted with the FSL software library (FMRIB, Oxford University, UK) (Smith et al.,  ; Woolrich et al.,  ; Jenkinson et al.,  ; Kohut et al.,  ). The first 100 volumes and last 200 volumes of the datasets were removed to minimize motion effects, leaving 900 volumes for analysis. Intensity spiking was detected and mitigated using an open-source program ( ) with a percentage threshold of 2 and a voxel threshold of 129 (defined as 3 median average deviates greater than the median number of voxels exceeding the percentage threshold). The de-spiked images were then motion corrected and high pass filtered with a 100 s cutoff. For registration to standard space, functional volumes were aligned to the VALiDATe (Gao et al.,  : Schilling et al.,  ) T2w template through a 12 DOF affine transformation followed by adjustment of nonlinear distortion fields using the jip analysis toolkit ( ). The VALiDATe brain mask was subsequently applied to perform final skull stripping. For quality assurance, scan metrics were assessed using MRIQC (Esteban et al.,  ), and group mean motion statistics were computed for the dataset. \n\n\n### 2.5. sLFO characterization and removal \n  \nSystemic low frequency oscillation was characterized using rapidtide, an open-source package implementing the Regressor Interpolation at Progressive Time Delays (RIPTiDe) method (Frederick,  ). Details of the RIPTiDe procedure have been described previously (Erdogan et al.,  ; Tong et al.,  ). Briefly, the default Rapidtide parameters were used with the exception of some modifications noted below. First, the resting state fMRI data was filtered to the low frequency band (0.01–0.15 Hz) and a Gaussian spatial filter with a 0.75 mm kernel width was applied to smooth the data, reflecting the smaller brain size of the squirrel monkey. A seed regressor was generated by averaging BOLD signal across all voxels in the brain, and recursively refined in three passes by calculating the relative arrival time of the regressor in each voxel by fitting the peak of the cross-correlation function within a time window of −16 to 12 s relative to the mode of the delay times (NB: the time window used is larger than the expected delay range to allow for better fitting of the relatively broad correlation peaks. The search range parameter is an operational tuning parameter of the Rapidtide program and does not determine the range of delays obtained. The search range used here was empirically determined from multiple runs), time-shifting each voxel's time course to align with the regressor, and then using principal component analysis to extract a signal representing 80% of the variance of all shifted BOLD voxels. The refined regressor was cross-correlated with the time course in each voxel, and the peak of the cross-correlation was fit with a Gaussian function to calculate the maximum correlation coefficient and the relative arrival time of sLFO in each voxel. If no peak could be uniquely determined, the delay and maximum correlation value were set to zero; however, the SNR was sufficiently high after spatial filtering that there were very few voxels without fittable peaks. In contrast to humans, the blood arrival time distribution was found to be bimodal. Therefore, the initial moving regressor was calculated and refined using only gray matter voxels, as the blood signal is stronger and has more uniform delays in gray matter in squirrel monkeys, and the “pickleft” flag was used to restrict refinement to voxels in the earlier delay time peak. The relative arrival time was defined as the time when maximum cross-correlation was reached. It is important to note that since we do not have an absolute reference for zero arrival time, zero is set arbitrarily to the peak of the arrival time distribution histogram, i.e., the mode. The refined regressor was then time-shifted by this relative arrival time to generate voxel-wise regressors to remove the moving hemodynamic component from the functional data by means of general linear model. The VALiDATe gray matter mask was supplied to restrict the calculation to gray matter only. \n\n\n### 2.6. Pseudoperiodicity \n  \nWhile using a frequency range up to 0.15 Hz (~6.67 s cycle time) does lead to the possibility that the moving regressor will be pseudoperiodic, this is unavoidable, as this is the range in which neuronally driven hemodynamic fluctuations are found. Pseudoperiodicity in the sLFO waveform is always a concern in performing rapidtide analysis when unambiguous delay estimation is the goal. Fortunately, this is not as large a problem as it may seem, particularly in this instance. First, because the sLFO signal is essentially random, usually with a fairly flat frequency spectrum, it is usually   not   pseudoperiodic, and as long as any “dominant” frequency is below ~0.06 Hz, correlation sidelobes will not occur within the peak search range. Second, rapidtide checks the regressor for pseudoperiodicity, and implements a number of mitigation strategies, including voxelwise peak shifting by the pseudoperiod to remove spatial discontinuities in the delay map, and notch filtering out the dominant periodic frequency during delay estimation. Finally, in the case of denoising, as we are doing here, if there are multiple indistinguishable peaks in the cross-correlation, then which one we use is not important, as we will remove essentially the same noise signal in each case (this is not the case when we are estimating delay for its own sake). \n\n\n### 2.7. Independent component analysis and dual regression \n  \nGroup level time concatenated independent component analysis (ICA) and dual regression were conducted within FSL to evaluate the performance of the noise reduction method. Initially, a series of group ICAs were computed with the non-denoised dataset, with varied dimensionality (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50), to determine the optimal number of independent components (ICs). The optimal number of ICs was chosen based on sufficient separation from noise and reasonable merging of the same resting state networks and is consistent with previously published reports in animal subjects (e.g., Hutchison et al.,  ; Jonckers et al.,  ; Belcher et al.,  ). The group IC maps estimated from group ICA with the dimensionality of 25 were then used as template in the following dual regression. The 25 component ICA was repeated on the rapidtide-denoised dataset, and the components in the denoised ICA were matched to their non-denoised equivalents using PICAchooser (Frederick,  ). \n\nThe dual regression was carried out in two steps. The group spatial IC template was first regressed into both the non-denoised dataset and the denoised dataset to compute subject-specific timecourses. Subject-specific spatial ICs were then identified by regressing subject-specific timecourses against each subject's own fMRI data. Next, permutation-based non-parametric testing was implemented to quantify the difference in ICs before and after noise reduction; 5,000 permutations were used in the analysis and the resulting statistical maps were thresholded at   p   ≤ 0.05 (threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) corrected). To visualize the distribution of sLFO relative arrival time within each IC, a probability density map was plotted for each IC. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. sLFO signal estimation with RIPTiDe \n  \nThe top panel of   shows the average maximum correlation coefficient map of all 12 subjects. High correlation values were observed, primarily within gray matter, suggesting that sLFO constitute a significant portion of the fMRI signal within the low frequency range. The individual maximum correlation coefficient maps for each subject in the lower panels show that the pattern is consistent across individual subjects. \n  \nMaximum correlation coefficient map. The top panel shows the average map across all 12 subjects, while the maps at the bottom represent subject-specific maximum correlation coefficient maps. The percentage of variance explained by the time shifted LFO regressor in each voxel is 100 * (correlation coefficient) . Cross-correlation between each individual map and the average map was performed, and the correlation coefficient is indicated above each individual map; note that correlation values are strong across all subjects (>0.9). \n  \n displays the sLFO relative arrival time maps (group average in the top panel, individual maps below). The regions of early arrival are shown in cool colors (blue, light blue and green), while regions of late arrival are shown in warm colors (red and yellow). The map clearly depicts a consistent pattern of blood circulation in squirrel monkey brain; sLFOs arrive early in bilateral motor and somatosensory cortex where middle cerebral arteries reside, while those regions with later arrival of sLFO appeared mainly in regions close to the vascular drainage system, i.e., ventricles and cerebellum. White matter also has generally later arrival times than gray matter. The sLFO circulation pattern is consistent across subjects, with varied sLFO arrival time, with differences most likely due to individual variation in the vascular anatomy. Overall, these results support the contention that the sLFO signal is embedded in the underlying physiological circulation and is consistent with blood flow mapping in humans using sLFO delays (Erdogan et al.,  ), which have been cross validated with dynamic susceptibility mapping (Erdogan et al.,  ). \n  \nsLFO arrival time maps. The mean arrival time map for the group is shown at the top, followed by subject-specific individual arrival time maps. Delays are in seconds relative to the peak of the voxelwise delay histogram. Cross-correlation between each individual map and the average map was performed, and the correlation coefficient is indicated above each individual map. The majority of the correlations (8 of 12 subjects) were moderate (0.5–0.7) to strong (≥0.7). \n  \n\n### 3.2. Group level independent component analysis and dual regression \n  \nAfter visual inspection of a series of group IC maps with different dimensionality, 25 spatial IC maps computed by group ICA of the original data were used as the template for dual regression and subsequent statistical analysis to compare the networks before and after the application of rapidtide denoising.   shows the comparison results for two of the representative resting state networks; lateral visual network and cerebellar network. For referencing purposes, the IC templates (original resting state network) are shown in the first row of  . The second row represents group average of spatial ICs of non-denoised dataset, and the third row displays group mean spatial ICs for the denoised dataset. Group comparison results through permutation testing are presented in row 4. The lateral visual network exhibits a wide distribution of significant noise reduction; in contrast, the cerebellar network exhibits very localized noise reduction. Based on their sLFO arrival time distribution (row 5), the voxels within the lateral visual network have similar range of sLFO relative arrival times as the voxels within the whole brain (the arrival time distribution largely overlaps with that of the whole brain sLFO), hence rapidtide denoising affects multiple voxels across the whole brain. The voxels within the cerebellar network, however, have relatively later sLFO arrival time (the peak occurs several seconds after the peak of whole brain distribution); thus, noise reduction only exists in voxels with later sLFO arrival time. This relationship holds for most of the networks; the number of significantly changed voxels tends to increase as the center of mass (COM) of the delay distribution within the IC moves farther from the overall COM of delays throughout the brain. In fact, 16 of the 25 ICs showed >25% of voxels and 8 of 25 ICs showed >50% of voxels in the brain change significantly after denoising (see  – ,  ). It's important to recognize that ICs are thresholded for display to show only voxels that meet a level of significance, but the IC contains continuous spatial patterns that extend throughout the brain and exist both within, and outside, of the thresholded z-maps. This is described in greater detail in the  , along with depictions of all the significant networks before and after denoising. \n  \nResults from IC1, the lateral visual   (left)   and IC14, the cerebellar network   (right)  .   Top row:   IC computed from original data;   second row:   averaged spatial ICs of non-denoised dataset;   third row:   averaged spatial ICs of denoised dataset;   fourth row:   statistical map representing significant reduction in IC after sLFO removal (TFCE-corrected), the number of significant voxels is also calculated and indicated above the statistical map;   fifth row:   probability density map showing number of voxels within IC at different sLFO arrival time. \n  \n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThe present study demonstrates that time lag mapping can be successfully applied to non-human primate fMRI data for visualizing spatiotemporal patterns of sLFOs. This finding is consistent with previous reports in human subjects (Tong et al.,  ). Furthermore, the delay map clearly resembles the patterns of cerebral blood circulation, implying a hemodynamic, rather than neuronal, origin. The sLFO relative arrival time patterns, while generally similar, vary across individuals since they have different vascular anatomy. This yields new insight into the circulatory architecture of non-human primates, as well as information on individual differences which may be of use to assess neurovascular health. \n\nPerhaps of more interest to those interested in neuronal connectivity, however, is the magnitude of this signal component. The correlation maps indicate that up to 64% of the voxel-wise BOLD signal variance (100 × the square of the correlation coefficient) was explained by sLFOs. In contrast, gray matter sLFO variance in humans is predominantly < 50% (Erdogan et al.,  ). Therefore, it is even more important to remove this heterogeneous signal of non-neuronal origin in squirrel monkeys. In an attempt to better illustrate the effect of sLFO contamination on resting state networks, we performed an ICA analysis to extract resting-state networks using the same rs-fMRI data with and without denoising. Although we tuned the number of components to maximize the separation of noise while still maintaining the networks of interest, each component still contains significant low frequency physiological noise. This will negatively affect subsequent statistical analysis and interpretation. Since up to ~2/3 of the gray matter signal variance in the low frequency band used to estimate neuronal connectivity carries no relevant information about neuronal activity, if these signals are not removed, they will bias connectivity measures toward hemodynamic factors (i.e., areas where blood coincidentally arrives at similar times will appear to be functionally connected). In pharmacological challenges, which can have profound effects on both neuronal and hemodynamic function, the inability to separate these effects will significantly limit the validity of connectivity changes as a tool for assessing neuronal effects. In the current study, the RSNs computed from denoised data and the dual regression results comparing RSNs before and after denoising showed that the physiological noise was significantly reduced after removing sLFOs, and the extent of reduction is related to the brain region contained in the IC. More specifically, if ICs contain brain regions that have a similar sLFO arrival time as the majority of brain regions, they will have broad reductions after denoising. Contrarily, if ICs contain voxels with sLFO relative arrival times that differ significantly with the majority of the voxels within the whole brain, more localized reductions could be observed. These results have further demonstrated the need to remove sLFOs before analyzing rs-fMRI data. \n\nThis analysis demonstrates the rapidtide package (Frederick,  ), provides a simple set of open-source turnkey tools to perform this retrospective denoising in non-human primate data. It is easily applied retrospectively to existing datasets, as it can extract sLFO regressors directly from the fMRI data itself without the need of external recordings, and it removes significant hemodynamic noise contamination from resting state data without the pitfalls of global signal regression (Erdogan et al.,  ). Therefore, we suggest incorporating rapidtide denoising in non-human primate fMRI data as a standard step in the preprocessing pipeline. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Ethics statement \n  \nThe animal study was reviewed and approved by McLean Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nParticipated in research design and wrote or contributed to the writing of the manuscript: LC, SK, and BF.

Participants included 27 adolescents who were clinically recovered from concussion and 29 never‐concussed, typically developing controls (10–17 years); all participants were examined using the Physical and Neurologic Examination of Subtle Signs (PANESS). Functional connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) or dorsal attention network (DAN) and regions of interest within the motor network was assessed using resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Compared to controls, adolescents clinically recovered from concussion showed greater subtle motor deficits as evaluated by the PANESS and increased connectivity between the DMN and left lateral premotor cortex. DMN to left lateral premotor cortex connectivity was significantly correlated with the total PANESS score, with more atypical connectivity associated with more motor abnormalities. This suggests that altered functional connectivity of the brain may underlie subtle motor deficits in adolescents who have clinically recovered from concussion. More investigation is required to understand the persistence and longer‐term clinical relevance of altered functional connectivity and associated subtle motor deficits to inform whether functional connectivity may serve as an important biomarker related to longer‐term outcomes after clinical recovery from concussion. \n  \nThis study examined functional connectivity and subtle motor deficits in adolescents clinically recovered from a concussion. Compared to never‐injured controls, adolescents clinically recovered from concussion showed greater subtle motor deficits and increased connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and left lateral premotor cortex. DMN to left lateral premotor cortex connectivity significantly correlated with the total PANESS score, with more atypical connectivity associated with more motor abnormalities.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nConcussions (mild traumatic brain injury [mTBI]) are a serious public health concern, and adolescents may be uniquely susceptible to negative long‐term consequences (Schmidt et al.,  ). The adolescent brain shows continued maturation during this age range and may be more vulnerable to longer recovery from a brain injury (Field et al.,  ). There is growing consensus that neurobiological recovery following a pediatric concussion may be incomplete at medical clearance to return to play (Churchill et al.,  ,  ). Common assessments of pediatric concussions, including self‐ or parent‐reported questionnaires or neuropsychological tests, are highly sensitive in the acute phase but demonstrate reduced sensitivity in the sub‐acute phase (>1‐week post‐injury; McCrea et al.,  ). Additionally, most measures do not provide an index of the underlying neuropathology (Schmidt et al.,  ). \n\nEmerging research suggests that adolescents who have clinically recovered from concussion (and have been cleared to return to play) still show abnormalities in motor performance (Crasta, Raja, et al.,  ; Howell et al.,  ; Sosnoff et al.,  ; Stephens et al.,  ). Persistent motor deficits following injury in concussed athletes are also observed during gait and postural control tasks (Murray et al.,  ) and on motor performance during dual‐task conditions (Howell et al.,  ). Moreover, asymptomatic adolescents can display atypical cognitive‐motor performance until nearly 2 years post‐concussion (Dalecki et al.,  ). These findings are particularly noteworthy considering the increased incidence of additional injuries in athletes returning to play (Herman et al.,  ; Howell et al.,  ) and proposed underlying neuromuscular control deficits associated with lower‐extremity musculoskeletal injury following recovery from concussion (Eagle et al.,  ; Oldham et al.,  ). From a mechanistic perspective, Cantarero et al. ( ) utilized non‐invasive brain stimulation to demonstrate corticomotor pathway dysfunction and deficits in motor skill learning, due to impaired retention, that begin within 2 weeks of concussion and persist >1‐year post‐injury (Cantarero et al.,  ). As such, there is a critical need for behavioral measures that are sensitive to motor control and learning deficits in young athletes to identify those at greatest risk. Furthermore, there is a need for ongoing research examining the neurophysiological basis of these motor deficits to support the development and evaluation of rehabilitative interventions. \n\nRecent research has shown that the Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs (PANESS; Denckla,  ) can detect persistent motor sequelae beyond the acute phase in pediatric concussion and is more sensitive to subtle motor dysfunction across the severity spectrum of pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared to standard neurocognitive measures (Crasta, Raja, et al.,  ; Stephens et al.,  ,  ,  ). The PANESS is a brief (~20 min to administer) performance‐based measure evaluating subtle motor signs of overflow, dysrhythmia, and speed of movements during gait, balance, and timed activities, capturing bilateral performance and using less familiar tasks (e.g., walking on the sides of the feet, heel tapping; Denckla,  ). The PANESS demonstrates strong psychometric properties including construct validity (Crasta et al.,  ; Saleem et al.,  ), test–retest reliability (Holden et al.,  ; Stephens et al.,  ; Vitiello et al.,  ), and inter‐rater reliability (Svingos et al.,  ; Vitiello et al.,  ). \n\nThe PANESS is sensitive to the effects of age (Crasta, Raja, et al.,  ; Crasta, Zhao, et al.,  ), and performance on the measure improves with time since injury among children with concussion (Stephens et al.,  ) and mild–moderate TBI (Stephens et al.,  ). After accounting for confounding effects of age and level of athletic ability, adolescents fully cleared to return to activities after concussion exhibit greater subtle motor deficits on the PANESS compared to never‐injured controls (Crasta, Raja, et al.,  ). The enhanced sensitivity of the PANESS for deficits related to subtle motor function and motor learning, compared to simple motor function tasks often used during clinical care, suggests that the PANESS may be a good candidate as a marker of neurophysiological changes after concussion (Crasta, Raja, et al.,  ; Stephens et al.,  ). \n\nDeficits on the PANESS have also been linked to alterations in brain structure and function in children with more severe forms of TBI. In children more than 1 year after moderate–severe TBI, greater motor deficits were associated with a smaller volume of motor/premotor cortex (Crasta et al.,  ). Risen et al. ( ) investigated functional connectivity of the (a) default mode network (DMN) and (b) dorsal attention network (DAN) with the rest of the brain in adolescents with mild‐complicated and moderate TBI 2 months post‐injury and showed that between‐group differences from control participants were limited to connectivity with motor regions (Risen et al.,  ). In these children with TBI, increased (more atypical) connectivity between the DMN and motor regions was associated with poorer motor performance on the PANESS. The authors posited that increased connectivity between the DMN (a task‐negative network typically deactivated during tasks demanding outward attention) and motor regions may impair task‐related recruitment of motor regions. In contrast, increased (also more atypical) connectivity between the DAN and motor regions correlated with better motor performance (Risen et al.,  ). The authors hypothesized that increased connectivity of motor regions with the DAN, a task‐positive network activated during attention‐demanding tasks (Raichle,  ), may serve as a compensatory mechanism. Further research is required to examine if a similar relationship between motor performance and functional connectivity exists in adolescents with concussion. \n\nTo date, in adolescents post‐concussion, studies have shown altered functional connectivity across various regions, not only during the symptomatic phase of concussion but also after the resolution of acute symptoms (Churchill et al.,  ; Rausa et al.,  ; Schmidt et al.,  ). A common finding across studies includes persistent hyper‐connectivity between the DMN and other networks such as the DAN, and such alterations have been associated with poor outcomes (Iyer et al.,  ; Schmidt et al.,  ). Studies have also consistently shown both structural (Borich et al.,  ; Virji‐Babul et al.,  ) and functional (Ashe et al.,  ; Borich et al.,  ; Schmidt et al.,  ) alterations in the attention network and motor regions including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region associated with top‐down control of goal‐directed motor performance and explicit motor learning. Increased connectivity within motor regions in adolescent mTBI has been shown to persist up to 3 months post‐injury (Manning,  ), and alterations in the mPFC have been associated with persistent post‐concussion symptoms following pediatric mTBI (Iyer et al.,  ). However, there is limited research examining the clinical correlates of persisting altered connectivity post‐concussion including in youth who have been medically cleared post‐injury. \n\nImaging studies on concussion have often failed to find strong brain–behavior relationships which have been partly attributed to the lack of sensitive clinical assessments (Schmidt et al.,  ). Currently, there is no optimal behavioral marker that is sensitive to recovery from a pediatric concussion, associated with functional connectivity, and feasible for widespread clinical use (Schmidt et al.,  ). Given this need, the present study aimed to examine whether subtle motor performance, as measured by the PANESS, is associated with altered functional connectivity in adolescents clinically recovered from concussion. Building from prior research, we examined the functional connectivity of (a) DMN and (b) DAN with pre‐determined motor regions of interest (ROIs). Applying whole‐brain analyses in one data set to both discover group differences in functional connectivity and examine relationships between functional connectivity and behavior can result in circular analyses (Kriegeskorte et al.,  ). To avoid this circularity, we selected motor ROIs based on anatomically defined parcellations of the frontal lobe in children (Ranta et al.,  ). We hypothesized that adolescents clinically recovered from concussion would show increased functional connectivity compared to controls and that more anomalous functional connectivity would be associated with greater motor deficits on the PANESS. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Procedure \n  \nThe Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Research Board approved this research. Child assent and parent/guardian's written informed consent were obtained before study participation for all participants. Data from participants ages 10–17 years with a recent history of concussion (following symptom resolution and subjective return to baseline) and never‐concussed, neurotypical controls were made available from across three different research protocols (including a subset of participants whose PANESS data have been previously published; Crasta, Raja, et al.,  ). \n\nFor inclusion in the current study, participants needed to have behavioral testing and resting state neuroimaging conducted at the same research study visit. For inclusion in the concussion group, participants needed to have a diagnosis of concussion with subsequent clinical recovery, defined as resolution of all concussion symptoms and subjective return to baseline (assessed via parent report). Participants were excluded if they did not have a resting state fMRI scan meeting quality assurance criteria (see Section   for details) or if they had developmental/learning/mental health diagnoses (e.g., attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression), or any other medical diagnosis known to be associated with altered brain function or structure (e.g., history of epilepsy; moderate to severe TBI). \n\n\n### Measures \n  \n#### Revised Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs \n  \nPANESS (Denckla,  ) administrations were conducted by a trained psychology associate or masters‐level research assistant in a laboratory setting (hallway for gait assessment portion, testing room for other portions). Total PANESS summary scores were used for analysis in the current study which reflects the sum of total scores for the timed motor (total timed summary score) and gaits and stations (total gaits and stations summary score) sections of the PANESS. The gaits and stations section involves items requiring walking on heels, toes, and sides of feet, forward and backward tandem gait, and balance tasks including maintaining tandem stance with eyes closed, standing on both feet with eyes closed, and with arms and fingers outstretched, standing on one foot, and hopping. Scores for this section are derived based on the presence of ambulatory errors, impersistence, foot‐to‐hand overflow, and involuntary movements (e.g., choreiform). The timed motor section includes repetitive and sequenced movements such as foot‐tapping, heel‐toe tapping, hand patting, hand pronation/supination, finger tapping, finger apposition (tapping the thumb to each of the four other fingers in a fixed sequence), and tongue‐wagging. Scores in this section incorporate speed for completing repetitive and sequenced movements as well as the presence of any overflow or dysrhythmia during associated trials. Total PANESS scores range from 0 to 105, with higher scores reflecting greater subtle motor signs, including the presence of balance disturbances, speed/accuracy deficits, overflow movements, and dysrhythmia. Overflow scores were not age‐corrected (Crasta, Zhao, et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Lifetime Sports Participation Questionnaire \n  \nParents of all participants completed a survey describing their child's lifetime history of participation in organized sports or related physical activities, such as dance, and the associated level of competition for each sport/activity. For the current study, data was available as to the highest level of competition reported for each child in one of four categories: none, recreational (no try‐outs), school, or travel/select. For analysis, the competition level was grouped into low (non‐athletes and those participating in organized sports or related activities only at a recreational level) and high (participation in school and/or travel/select activities; Crasta, Raja, et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Imaging protocol \n  \nAll participants underwent brief training in a mock scanner to habituate to the MRI environment and to practice lying still. Resting state‐fMRI was acquired during a 6‐min 40‐s scan (including the first 10 s that were discarded for magnetization stabilization) on a 3.0‐T Philips “Achieva” MRI scanner (Best, The Netherlands) using a single‐shot, partially parallel, gradient‐recalled echo‐planar sequence with SENSitivity Encoding (SENSE) and a 32‐channel receiver head coil (repetition time [TR] = 2500 ms, echo time [TE] = 30 ms, flip angle = 75°, SENSE acceleration factor of 3, in‐plane resolution = 3.0 × 3.0 mm, matrix size = 84 × 84, 156 volumes saved). Whole‐brain coverage was obtained using 47 contiguous 3 mm axial slices acquired in ascending order, parallel to the anterior and posterior commissure (AC‐PC plane). Participants were instructed to relax and focus on a centrally located crosshair mark during scan acquisition. \n\n\n#### Resting state‐fMRI processing \n  \nPreprocessing of functional images was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 12, Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London, United Kingdom) and custom‐written MATLAB scripts (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA). Resting state‐fMRI scans were slice‐time adjusted using the slice acquired at the middle of the TR as a reference. Next, rigid body realignment parameters from alignment with the mean volume were estimated to account for participant head motion. The volume collected in the middle of the scan was spatially normalized using the Montreal Neurological Institute EPI template (Calhoun et al.,  ). The estimated rigid body and nonlinear spatial transformations were applied to the functional data in one unified step, resulting in 2 mm isotropic voxels. Linear trends were removed from the data on a voxelwise basis. Nuisance signals were estimated from the ventricles and white matter using the aCompCor method (Muschelli et al.,  ), which has been shown to enhance group discriminability (Shirer et al.,  ), and then regressed from each voxel along with linearly detrended versions of the six motion parameters and their first derivatives estimated through backward differences. A 6‐mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) filter was used to spatially smooth functional images that were then temporally filtered (bandpass 0.01–0.1 Hz). Prior to imaging analysis, all scans were checked for image quality and registration to the EPI template by two trained research assistants. All included data met motion criteria of between‐volume translational movements <3 mm and rotational movements <3° (Fassbender et al.,  ). Mean and max framewise displacement (FD) were calculated using the realignment parameters (Power et al.,  ) and group differences in mean and max FD were assessed using independent samples   t  ‐tests. \n\n\n#### Resting‐state fMRI connectivity analysis \n  \nA seed‐based correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate DMN–motor and DAN–motor functional connectivity. First, the DMN and the DAN were represented by three predefined 6 mm‐radius spherical seeds centered at locations based on existing resting state‐fMRI studies (Fox et al.,  ; Risen et al.,  ). The DMN seeds included the mPFC (Talairach coordinates: −1, 47, −4), posterior cingulate cortex (−5, −49, 40), and the lateral parietal cortex (−45, −67, 36). The DAN seeds included the intra‐parietal sulcus (−25, −57, 46), frontal eye field (25, −13, 50), and the middle temporal region (−45, −69, −2). The seed coordinates were converted to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the Lancaster transformation (Lancaster et al.,  ). For each participant, an average time course was generated for each seed. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between each seed region's average time course and every other voxel within the brain and then converted to a normal distribution by Fisher's   z  ‐transformation. The three whole‐brain connectivity maps for each network were averaged to generate one DMN and DAN map for each participant. \n\nSecond, given our specific interest in examining DMN and DAN functional connectivity with the motor system, we created a single motor mask by combining eight functionally relevant motor ROIs from the Ranta Atlas aligned to MNI space (primary motor cortex [M1], the sensorimotor motor cortex [SMC], lateral premotor cortex, and mPFC for each hemisphere; Ranta et al.,  ). Multivariable regression models including sex and competition level as covariates were constructed to examine group differences in DMN–motor and DAN–motor functional connectivity for every voxel within the motor mask. Sex and competition level were included as covariates given their confounding role on motor skills and lack of 1:1 matching for these variables (Crasta, Raja, et al.,  ). The significance of group differences was assessed using a voxel‐level threshold of   p   < .001, in combination with a cluster‐level threshold of   p   < .05, and then we identified the Ranta ROI in which any significant clusters were located. \n\nTo explore the clinical relevance of these group‐level functional connectivity differences, we also examined brain–behavior associations. To avoid circular analyses and to validate prior brain–behavior relationships (Risen et al.,  ), we examined connectivity across the entirety of each of the eight anatomically defined Ranta motor ROIs for this analysis. Using the entirety of each motor ROI allows for the generalizability of brain–behavior relationships beyond isolated findings of significant voxels associated with the group differences as defined in the analysis described above and minimizes the potential for double‐dipping (Kriegeskorte et al.,  ,  ). For each participant and network, we calculated the average functional connectivity score within each motor ROI separately. As a result, 16 connectivity values (eight DMN‐to‐motor pairs, and eight DAN‐to‐motor pairs) were derived for each participant. See Figure   for a summary of our processing pipeline. \n  \nProcessing pipeline for resting‐state fMRI and seed‐based functional connectivity. All subject‐level processing steps are outlined from (a) to (d). (a) Resting‐state fMRI data were obtained from both the concussion group and control group. All participants' data were preprocessed using the same steps. (b) The DAN included three task‐positive seed regions: FEF, IPS, and MT+. The DMN included three task‐negative seed regions: LPC, mPFC, and PCC. (c) Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between the mean time course of each seed region and every other brain voxel, and then converted to   z  ‐scores via Fisher's   z   transformation. (d) Correlation maps from task positive and task negative seed regions were averaged to generate one DAN and one DMN connectivity map for each participant. (e) Group differences in DAN–motor and DMN–motor functional connectivity were assessed for all voxels within a single motor mask while controlling for sex and competition level. Correlation maps and motor ROI masks computed in volume space were inflated to the surface for display purposes only. DAN, dorsal attention network; DMN, default mode network; FEF, frontal eye field; IPS, intra‐parietal sulcus; LPC, lateral parietal cortex; M1, primary motor cortex; mPFC, medial prefrontal cortex; MT+, middle temporal region; PCC, posterior cingulate cortex; ROIs, regions of interest; SMC, supplementary motor cortex. \n  \nAnalysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to assess group differences in PANESS scores with and without confounder adjustment. The effects of the covariates on these analyses are provided in Table  . Effect sizes are reported using partial eta‐squared (  η  ; small = 0.01, medium = 0.06, large = 0.14; Richardson,  ). Brain–behavior relationships across each Ranta motor‐relevant ROI were examined using partial correlations between network connectivity and total PANESS score controlling for sex and competition level in the whole sample and within each group. Multiple regressions were run to predict the total PANESS score from group, sex, competition level, and the various DMN and DAN motor connectivity pairs. For brain–behavior relationships, we did not correct for multiple comparisons. Data were inspected for outliers above 3.29 standard deviations, assessed for normality, and tested for the appropriate statistical assumptions per statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 25. Left‐ and mixed‐handed participants were excluded from primary analyses given our interest in functional connectivity involving motor regions; however, analyses including these participants are provided in   for reference. \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Participant demographics \n  \nA total of 32 concussion participants completed resting‐state imaging, but   n   = 2 were excluded from analysis due to scans failing to meet motion quality control criteria and   n   = 3 were non‐righted‐handed. In the never‐concussed group,   n   = 3, were excluded from primary analyses due to non‐right‐handedness. The final sample included 27 adolescents in the concussion group (13 males;   M   = 14.71; SD = 2.51) and 29 never‐concussed, neurotypical children (11 males;   M   = 14.50, SD = 2.45 years). Participant characteristics and total PANESS scores are presented in Table  . For the concussion group, the mean number of days post‐concussion was 80.30,   SD   = 41.91, range of 27–183 days. For a subset of the concussion group (  n   = 22, 81%), the exact clearance date was documented, and mean days from injury to clearance was 41.36, SD = 25.27, range 10–97 days. No significant group differences were found for mean FD (  p   = .55) and max FD (  p   = .47). \n  \nParticipant demographics and PANESS scores. \n    \n\n### Group differences in   PANESS  : Subtle motor performance is worse in adolescents clinically recovered from concussion compared to controls \n  \nThe ANCOVA model accounting for sex and competition level showed that the concussion group had worse motor performance on the total PANESS score (  F   = 5.85,   p   = .019,   η   = 0.101) than the control group. See Table   for details regarding the impact of covariates on subtle motor function. \n  \nEffect of covariates on subtle motor function. \n    \n\n### Group differences in functional connectivity:   DMN  –premotor functional connectivity is stronger in adolescents clinically recovered from concussion compared to controls \n  \nFigure   illustrates t‐maps of DMN–motor functional connectivity for the concussion group, the control group, and the concussion‐control group difference controlling for sex and competition level. Some evidence of regions within the motor mask showing both stronger and weaker functional connectivity with the DMN in concussion adolescents compared to controls can be seen. However, the only cluster with a significant group difference was found within the left lateral premotor region, in which the concussion group, on average, showed stronger functional connectivity with the DMN compared to the control group (peak MNI coordinate:   x   = −38,   y   = 0,   z   = 46,   p   = .049) and showed a positive correlation between these regions. In contrast, the control group showed no or slightly negative correlation between these regions. See Table   for details regarding the impact of covariates on peak MNI coordinates from regions with significant group differences and directionality. No other significant group differences in DMN–motor functional connectivity were observed. There were also no significant group differences observed in DAN–motor functional connectivity. \n  \nDefault mode network (DMN)–premotor functional connectivity is stronger in adolescents in the concussion group compared to controls.

Similarly, stronger DMN–right primary motor cortex (  p   = .032), and DMN–left/right SMC (  p   < .05) functional connectivity were associated with higher total PANESS scores or worse motor control (see Table  ). \n  \nStronger default mode network (DMN)–left lateral premotor functional connectivity is associated with poorer motor control. Trend lines are shown across all adolescents and within each group. \n    \nBrain–behavior relationships across levels of covariates. \n    \nCorrelations within each group separately indicated that the relationship between DMN–motor connectivity and total PANESS score was stronger in the concussion group (  r  ‐values range: 0.156–0.475) compared to the control group (  r  ‐values range: −0.211–0.316). In the concussion group, there was a statistically significant relationship between DMN–left/right lateral premotor cortex (  p   < .05), DMN–left/right primary motor cortex (  p   < .05), and DMN–left/right SMC, and total PANESS score. There were no other significant associations between other DMN–motor pairs and total PANESS score. The DMN–motor pairs by group multiple regression models accounting for sex and competition level did not statistically significantly predict total PANESS score (see Table  ). \n\n\n####  DAN  –  motor   functional connectivity \n  \nFunctional connectivity between the DAN and all motor regions was significantly associated with total PANESS. Namely, stronger DAN–left/right lateral premotor cortex (  p   < .05), stronger DAN–left/right mPFC (  p   < .005), stronger DAN–left/right primary motor cortex (  p   < .05), and stronger DAN–left/right SMC (  p   < .05), were all associated with higher total PANESS, or more motor deficits (see Table  ). \n\nCorrelations within each group separately indicated that the relationship between DAN–motor connectivity and total PANESS score was stronger in the concussion group (  r  ‐values range: 0.359–0.568) compared to the control group (  r  ‐values range: 0.285–0.359). There was a statistically significant relationship between DAN–right lateral premotor functional connectivity (  p   = .041), DAN–left/right mPFC connectivity (  p   < .05), DAN–left/right primary motor cortex (  p   < .05), DAN–right SMC (  p   < .05), and total PANESS score in the concussion group and not in the control group. The DAN–motor pairs by group multiple regression models accounting for sex and competition level did not statistically significantly predict total PANESS score (see Table  ). \n\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThis study examined resting‐state functional connectivity and its relationship to subtle motor function as measured by the PANESS in adolescents clinically recovered from concussion and never‐concussed controls. Consistent with our hypothesis, compared to controls, adolescents with a history of concussion showed greater subtle motor deficits and increased intrinsic DMN–motor connectivity. The finding of greater subtle motor deficits in adolescents with a history of concussion compared to controls is consistent with prior findings in a cohort that included these participants (Crasta, Raja, et al.,  ). More anomalous DMN–motor connectivity patterns were associated with greater subtle motor deficits. This study provides the first evaluation of the association between altered network connectivity and subtle motor function in adolescents recovered from concussion. \n\nConsistent with literature showing global hyper‐connectivity patterns between brain networks (Churchill et al.,  ,  ; Manning,  ) as well as previous findings specific to the motor network post‐concussion (Schmidt et al.,  ; Trofimova et al.,  ), adolescents clinically recovered from concussion showed increased functional DMN–left lateral premotor cortex connectivity compared to controls. Regardless of the covariates included, there were cluster‐level group differences in connectivity between DMN and right and left lateral premotor regions, suggesting that this is an important region bilaterally. Our results also align with previous findings of increased DMN–motor connectivity in adolescents with mild‐complicated and moderate TBI (Risen et al.,  ). Borich and colleagues also showed increased resting‐state functional connectivity within the DMN and frontal networks in adolescents post‐concussion during the sub‐acute phase (Borich et al.,  ). Our results are consistent with findings from Churchill and colleagues indicating increased connectivity in motor regions beyond the acute symptomatic stage in adolescents post‐concussion (Churchill et al.,  ). \n\nOur behavioral finding of greater motor deficits on the PANESS is consistent with studies showing impaired motor learning in athletes with a history of concussion (Cantarero et al.,  ; De Beaumont et al.,  ). Additionally, our brain–behavior finding showing the association between the PANESS and altered DMN–left/right lateral premotor cortex connectivity is consistent with the role of the lateral premotor cortex in motor learning (Hardwick et al.,  ). A possible explanation of this brain–behavior relationship may be related to the “default mode interference” phenomenon, which posits that reduced DMN deactivation (increased interference) may lead to ineffective task performance and lapses in attention (Mayer et al.,  ; Sonuga‐Barke & Castellanos,  ; van der Horn et al.,  ). Studies in individuals with concussions have shown this effect, such that adults with persisting symptoms after concussion showed greater connectivity between the DMN and frontal regions, especially during difficult tasks compared to those without symptoms (van der Horn et al.,  ). Collegiate athletes with a history of concussion also show chronic deficits in motor learning, especially with retention (Cantarero et al.,  ). Overall, this suggests that the motor constructs examined by the PANESS including subtle motor function and motor learning may be particularly sensitive to long‐term neurophysiological recovery following a pediatric concussion; however, further research is required to validate these findings. There was an indication of group‐level differences when informally comparing marginal group results. However, interaction tests were not significant. Future studies with larger sample sizes would be warranted to fully investigate these potential interactions. \n\nStrikingly, greater DAN to motor network connectivity was associated with worse motor performance on the PANESS across all participants. Although we did not detect group differences in DAN–motor network synchrony, our results suggest that the attention network may play a role in motor function recovery post‐concussion. Our findings are in contrast to a study wherein increased DAN–motor connectivity was associated with better motor performance in children with more severe TBI (Risen et al.,  ). While both studies have relatively small sample sizes, this could potentially indicate that brain–behavior relationships may be different based on the severity of TBI. Stronger connectivity between the DMN and attention/executive networks has been linked to an overall disruption in high‐level attention processes (Borich et al.,  ), cognitive complaints (Mayer et al.,  ), and is suggestive of issues with network switching (van der Horn et al.,  ). In milder brain injuries like concussions, this reallocation of resources may be a marker of relatively more severe injury and be detrimental to behavioral performance (Churchill et al.,  ; Viano et al.,  ). In contrast, in more severe TBI, hyper‐connectivity may suggest the availability of neural resources and may function as an adaptive response (Hillary et al.,  ). It is also plausible that DAN to motor network connectivity reflects a compensatory increase in functional connectivity secondary to loss of structural connectivity (Palacios et al.,  ; Virji‐Babul et al.,  ). For future research, it will be helpful to include multi‐modal neuroimaging methods such as fMRI and diffusion‐tensor imaging to shed more light on neural recovery processes following concussions and to assess changes in functional connectivity longitudinally during the course of clinical recovery and beyond. Future work will also benefit from the incorporation of a reference group who have not clinically recovered (either through a longitudinal design monitoring youth from the point of injury or through inclusion of a reference group of participants with persisting symptoms following concussion). Future studies should also seek to understand if youth with concussion that demonstrate anomalous functional connectivity and neuromotor performance are more likely to sustain secondary injuries such as repeated concussions and orthopedic injuries. \n\nWe acknowledge the limitations associated with the unbalanced representation of competition level among the MC post‐concussion group; however, our results showed general stability regardless of covariates included. Given our modest sample size, the results should be considered preliminary and require replication in larger cohorts of adolescents who have clinically recovered following concussion. In addition, multiple comparisons remain an issue. However, our approach reduced comparisons to a small number of ROI pairs of interest, which evidenced complementary results. \n\nIn summary, the persistence of subtle motor deficits and related altered functional connectivity in adolescents clinically recovered from concussion highlights the need for more investigation of subtle persisting impairments which may be of clinical relevance for later outcomes after apparent recovery and may inform the development of rehabilitative interventions. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nStacy J.
